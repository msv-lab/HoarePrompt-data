You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we’ll look closely at its behavior concerning the problem description and identify any potential edge cases or flaws.

### Problem Analysis
Vasya needs to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
2. The coordinates of the points must fall within the limits \(0 \le x_i \le n\) and \(0 \le y_i \le m\) for \(i = 1, 2, 3\).

### Key Observations
1. The area of any triangle formed by three points can be calculated using the determinant method; however, in this case, the area needs to be exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
2. The program first checks if \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer. If it's not, it outputs "NO". This effectively filters out cases where an exact triangle area cannot be matched.
3. Then, it checks if the area is 0, which is not valid since the problem states \(k \ge 2\) and both \(n\) and \(m\) are also at least 1, implying the area can’t be zero.
4. After validating the area, the program tries to determine points based on specific conditions:
   - It tries to position the points based on whether the double area fits within the dimensions governed by \(n\) or \(m\).
   - However, the chosen coordinates may not always form a valid triangle, depending on their positions.

### Potential Issues
1. The program might generate points that result in collinear points, which would produce an area of 0, even if the area check passes. For instance:
   - If \(n = 2, m = 2, k = 2\), then \(\frac{nm}{k} = 2\). The program could generate the points (0,0), (2,1), and (0,1), which actually form a line since they share a common x-coordinate. The area calculated would be 0.
2. The assumption about area checks is inadequate; it should also check if the points generated actually satisfy the triangle area condition, rather than just assuming they do by their arrangement. 

### Conclusion
Given these observations and potential edge cases where the generated points do not form a valid triangle or meet the area requirement, it is clear that:

Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to ensure valid, non-collinear triangle formation for all valid inputs, particularly with corner cases where points might become collinear while still passing earlier checks.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent dimensions and a divisor, respectively. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the computed `area` is not an integer or is zero, the function outputs 'NO'. If `area` is a positive integer, it outputs 'YES' and attempts to provide coordinates based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `area`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints the coordinates '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, it prints '1 0'. If `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`, it halves `m` and then prints '0' followed by the value of `m // 2`. There are no return values; the function relies solely on print outputs to convey its findings. The code lacks functionality for input validation beyond area checks and does not handle cases explicitly where the area could lead to negative outputs in an unaccounted manner.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
