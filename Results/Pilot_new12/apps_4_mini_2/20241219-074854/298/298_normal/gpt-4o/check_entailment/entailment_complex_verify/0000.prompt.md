You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the possible scenarios given the constraints for \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

1. **Understanding Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the triangle formed by the points should be equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
   - If the area is not an integer, it is impossible to have three points which will create a triangle of that exact area, so the output should be "NO".

2. **Point Generation**:
   - The program attempts to generate points based on the calculated area:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( n \), it tries to create two points using \( (2 \times \text{area}, 1) \) and \( (0, 1) \).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( m \), it generates points \( (1, 2 \times \text{area}) \) and \( (1, 0) \).
     - Otherwise, it defaults to using \( (n, m // 2) \) and \( (0, m // 2) \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program must check not only conditions for generating points but also must ensure that the points generated provide a valid triangle on the coordinate plane considering the bounds \( [0, n] \) and \( [0, m] \).
   - There are cases where the calculated area could be feasible mathematically, yet the produced points could still result in non-unique or collinear points depending on the generated coordinates.

4. **Counterexamples**:
   - Suppose we have \( n = 5, m = 2, k = 3 \):
     - The area will be \( \frac{10}{3} \).
     - Since this is not an integer, the output should rightly be "NO".
   - Now test with \( n = 5, m = 2, k = 5 \):
     - The area will be \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \):
       - The program would choose to output points but may lead to points forming collinear formations, as \( (0, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1) \) do indeed generate area but do not always guarantee non-collinearity.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the area checking and the conditions used in the program, there are scenarios where valid triangular formations may not be possible, especially since the logic does not adequately handle the generation of points to ensure they are not collinear.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')

If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 0' is printed. Otherwise, `m` is halved, and '0' followed by the value of `m // 4` is printed.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `area` is greater than `n / 2`, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9. If `area` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. If `area` is greater than `n / 2` and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; if `area` is not an integer, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `area` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. If `area` is greater than `n / 2` and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent dimensions and a divisor, respectively. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the computed `area` is not an integer or is zero, the function outputs 'NO'. If `area` is a positive integer, it outputs 'YES' and attempts to provide coordinates based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `area`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints the coordinates '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, it prints '1 0'. If `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`, it halves `m` and then prints '0' followed by the value of `m // 2`. There are no return values; the function relies solely on print outputs to convey its findings. The code lacks functionality for input validation beyond area checks and does not handle cases explicitly where the area could lead to negative outputs in an unaccounted manner.
