You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer, with the value of `area` greater than `n / 2`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 0' is printed. Otherwise, `m` is halved, and '0' followed by the value of `m // 4` is printed.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. Otherwise, if `area` is greater than `n / 2`, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9. If `area` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. If `area` is greater than `n / 2` and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; if `area` is not an integer, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `area` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. If `area` is greater than `n / 2` and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent dimensions and a divisor, respectively. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the computed `area` is not an integer or is zero, the function outputs 'NO'. If `area` is a positive integer, it outputs 'YES' and attempts to provide coordinates based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `area`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints the coordinates '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, it prints '1 0'. If `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`, it halves `m` and then prints '0' followed by the value of `m // 2`. There are no return values; the function relies solely on print outputs to convey its findings. The code lacks functionality for input validation beyond area checks and does not handle cases explicitly where the area could lead to negative outputs in an unaccounted manner.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
