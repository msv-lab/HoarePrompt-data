To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the possible scenarios given the constraints for \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

1. **Understanding Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the triangle formed by the points should be equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
   - If the area is not an integer, it is impossible to have three points which will create a triangle of that exact area, so the output should be "NO".

2. **Point Generation**:
   - The program attempts to generate points based on the calculated area:
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( n \), it tries to create two points using \( (2 \times \text{area}, 1) \) and \( (0, 1) \).
     - If \( 2 \times \text{area} \) is less than or equal to \( m \), it generates points \( (1, 2 \times \text{area}) \) and \( (1, 0) \).
     - Otherwise, it defaults to using \( (n, m // 2) \) and \( (0, m // 2) \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program must check not only conditions for generating points but also must ensure that the points generated provide a valid triangle on the coordinate plane considering the bounds \( [0, n] \) and \( [0, m] \).
   - There are cases where the calculated area could be feasible mathematically, yet the produced points could still result in non-unique or collinear points depending on the generated coordinates.

4. **Counterexamples**:
   - Suppose we have \( n = 5, m = 2, k = 3 \):
     - The area will be \( \frac{10}{3} \).
     - Since this is not an integer, the output should rightly be "NO".
   - Now test with \( n = 5, m = 2, k = 5 \):
     - The area will be \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \):
       - The program would choose to output points but may lead to points forming collinear formations, as \( (0, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1) \) do indeed generate area but do not always guarantee non-collinearity.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the area checking and the conditions used in the program, there are scenarios where valid triangular formations may not be possible, especially since the logic does not adequately handle the generation of points to ensure they are not collinear.

Correctness: **False**.
