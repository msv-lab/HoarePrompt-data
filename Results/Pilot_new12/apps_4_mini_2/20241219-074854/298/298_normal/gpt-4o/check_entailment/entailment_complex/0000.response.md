To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the key aspects of both the problem and the program's logic.

### Problem Summary:
The task requires finding three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) within defined bounds based on the input integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). Specifically, the area of the triangle formed by these three points should be exactly equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The outputs should indicate whether such points exist ("YES" followed by the points) or state that it is not possible ("NO").

### Program Behavior:
1. **Area Calculation**: The program computes the area using `area = n * m / k` and checks if it is an integer. If not, it prints "NO".
  
2. **Area Check**: If the area is zero or not an integer, it prints "NO".

3. **Output "YES" and Points**: If the area is valid:
   - It prints "YES".
   - It attempts to provide points based on the calculated area using conditional checks.

### Analysis of Conditions Imposed:
- **Area Conditions**:
  - The area must be non-zero and an integer: This is validated in the program.
  
- **Point Generation Logic**:
  - The logic that generates the points relies on checking whether \(2 \times \text{area}\) is less than or equal to \(n\) or \(m\).
  - The points chosen are:
    - \((0, 0)\) as one of the triangle points.
    - The second point is chosen based on the value of \(2 \times \text{area}\) in relation to \(n\) and \(m\).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case of Area Calculation**: If \(\text{area} = \frac{nm}{k}\) is not achievable as an integer (the program outputs "NO").
- **Point Selection**: When generating points:
  - The conditions appropriately check if the chosen points remain within the bounds mentioned in the problem.
  
- **Potential Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not explicitly account for whether the selected points actually form a valid triangle that meets the area requirement, given that the points strictly depend on the chosen values of \(2 \times \text{area}\). 
  - If \(k\) is such that \(\frac{nm}{k}\) leads to avoiding certain constraints, e.g., an area value resulting in negative coordinates, the program may fail to provide a valid triangle.

### Example Correlation:
From provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: Works correctly since valid points are generated that maintain the area requirement.
2. **Example 2**: "NO" is correctly printed as there are no valid integer points meeting the area necessity.

### Conclusion:
While the program captures key logic for area and outputs based on initial checks, it fails to validate if the points actually form a triangle that meets the area properly under certain edge cases. It primarily assumes that any valid checks for coordinates based solely on the area calculations will suffice without affirming the triangle's area property in all prospective selections.

Thus, the verdict is:

Correctness: **False** 

This is because there could exist test cases where the points generated do not satisfy the area condition despite appearing valid based on the checks performed.
