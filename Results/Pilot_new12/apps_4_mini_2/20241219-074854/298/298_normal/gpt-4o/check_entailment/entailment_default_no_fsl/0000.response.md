Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to consider cases where the area calculated, \( \frac{nm}{k} \), requires that the three chosen points must also independently satisfy the triangle area condition, aside from just being valid coordinates within the allowed range. The program generates points based on arbitrary conditions related to \( 2 \times \text{area} \) but does not ensure that the triangle formed by those points actually has the intended area of \( \frac{nm}{k} \). 

For example, consider the input \( n=4, m=4, k=7 \):
- The calculated area is \( \frac{16}{7} \), which is not an integer, so the function correctly outputs "NO".
- However, for \( n=4, m=6, k=3 \), the area would be \( \frac{24}{3} = 8 \).
  - The points produced could be \( (0, 0), (16, 1), (0, 1) \).
  - Despite the area being calculated as 8, the points used can lead to invalid coordinates outside the necessary bounds, failing to ensure a valid triangle area when coordinates exceed limits specified \( (x_i \leq n, y_i \leq m) \).

Moreover, the program does not validate or check whether the formed coordinates adhere to other requirements, meaning scenarios exist where it could incorrectly conclude that a triangle can be formed when it cannot, confirming that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. This inconsistency shows that the program lacks generalizability and correctness for all potential inputs.
