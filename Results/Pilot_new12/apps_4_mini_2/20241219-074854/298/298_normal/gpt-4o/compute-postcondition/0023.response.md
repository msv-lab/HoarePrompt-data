Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9. If `area` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` is 0 and the output is '0 1'. If `area` is greater than `n / 2` and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, the output is '1 0'. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, `m` is halved and the output is '0' followed by the value of `m // 4`.***
