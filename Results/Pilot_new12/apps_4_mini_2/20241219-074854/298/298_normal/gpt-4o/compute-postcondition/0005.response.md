The variable `area` is assigned the value obtained from casting the previous value of `area` to an integer. However, since `area` is already specified as being equal to `n * m / k` and is stated to be an integer, the value of `area` remains unchanged after this operation. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and `area` remains an integer.**
