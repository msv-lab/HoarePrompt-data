The code outputs a formatted string using the values of `n` and `m`. The value of `m` is divided by 2 using floor division.

Since the initial state includes the constraints that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9, and that `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` (which is a non-zero integer and greater than `n / 2`), we can derive the new state as follows:

1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
2. The value of `m` is halved using floor division. Therefore, the new value of `m` will be `m // 2`.

As a result, we will output the current values for `n` and `m // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `m` is equal to `m // 2` (where `m` is an input integer divided by 2 using floor division).**
