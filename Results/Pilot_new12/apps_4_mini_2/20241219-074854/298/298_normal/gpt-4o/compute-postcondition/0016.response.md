The `print` statement outputs a formatted string. The output includes the number `1` and the value of `2 * area`. Given that `area` is defined as `n * m / k`, we can substitute that into our output calculation. However, since the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not provided and only their relationships are described in the conditions, we can't determine specific numeric values.

The output information regarding `area` satisfies the condition that it is greater than `n / 2` and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, the expression `2 * area` translates to `(2 * (n * m / k))`, which gives us a general format without specific numerical output.

After executing the `print` statement, we note that the program does not alter the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. 

Thus, the information regarding the state of the variables remains as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer; the value of `area` is greater than `n / 2`, and the current value of `area` satisfies the condition `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`; output printed is '1 {2 * area}'.**
