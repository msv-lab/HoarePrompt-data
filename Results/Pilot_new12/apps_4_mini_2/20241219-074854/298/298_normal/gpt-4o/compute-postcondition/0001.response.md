`area` is assigned the value of `n * m / k`. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers and the product `n * m` can potentially be very large, the output will be dependent on the specific values assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the variable `area` will now represent the result of this calculation.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`.**
