Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent dimensions and a divisor, respectively. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the computed `area` is not an integer or is zero, the function outputs 'NO'. If `area` is a positive integer, it outputs 'YES' and attempts to provide coordinates based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `area`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints the coordinates '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, it prints '1 0'. If `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`, it halves `m` and then prints '0' followed by the value of `m // 2`. There are no return values; the function relies solely on print outputs to convey its findings. The code lacks functionality for input validation beyond area checks and does not handle cases explicitly where the area could lead to negative outputs in an unaccounted manner.**
