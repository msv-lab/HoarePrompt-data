The code prints '0 0', but it does not change any variables or their values. The variable states and the conditions remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer; output printed is '0 0'.**
