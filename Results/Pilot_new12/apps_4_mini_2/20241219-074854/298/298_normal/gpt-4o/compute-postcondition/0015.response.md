Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer; output printed is '0 0'; the value of `area` is greater than `n / 2`, and the current value of `area` satisfies the condition `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`.***
