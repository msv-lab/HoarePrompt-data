The code prints a formatted string containing `2 * area` and the integer `1`. The variable `area` was calculated as `n * m / k`, and it is a non-zero integer. Since we know the current value of `area` satisfies the condition that `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, this confirms that `2 * area` is valid as a printed value. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged in value. However, the printed output will be affected by the computation of `2 * area`.

Since the output of the print statement is '0 0', it indicates that `2 * area` evaluates to `0`. Given that `area` cannot be zero, it implies an inconsistency with the preconditions or is simply part of the output formatting as '0 0' does not reflect the actual calculations.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer; `2 * area` is 0 and the output printed is '0 0'.**
