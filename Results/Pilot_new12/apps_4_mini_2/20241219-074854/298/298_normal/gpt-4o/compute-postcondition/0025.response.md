The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly since it takes no arguments in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer that the function implicitly expects three integer inputs: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\). The function's output based on these inputs is not specified in the provided data. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not fully defined.

Functionality: **The function accepts integer parameters n, m, and k (implicitly). The specific functionality and return value based on these parameters are not defined in the provided output.**
