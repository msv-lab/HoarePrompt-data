The code prints the statement '0 1', which does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. Therefore, although the values of the variables remain unchanged, the output from the print statement must be acknowledged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer; `2 * area` is 0; printed output is '0 1'.**
