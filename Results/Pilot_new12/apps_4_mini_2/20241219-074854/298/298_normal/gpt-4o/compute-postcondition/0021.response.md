Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k` and is a non-zero integer, with the value of `area` greater than `n / 2`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 0' is printed. Otherwise, `m` is halved, and '0' followed by the value of `m // 4` is printed.***
