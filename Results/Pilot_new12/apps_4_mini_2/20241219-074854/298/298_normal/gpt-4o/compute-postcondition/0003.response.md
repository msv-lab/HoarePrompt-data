The code snippet calls `print('NO')`, which outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not alter any variable state. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the value of `area` remains a non-integer fraction derived from the existing values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, and `area` is not an integer; output is 'NO'.**
