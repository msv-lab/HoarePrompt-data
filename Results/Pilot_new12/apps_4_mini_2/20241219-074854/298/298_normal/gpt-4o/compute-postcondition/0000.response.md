`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` that are then converted to integers through `map(int, input().split())`. The previous conditions of the variables remain valid, but their values become whatever integer values the user provides through the input. Since the output specifies that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` change, we represent this as integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.**
