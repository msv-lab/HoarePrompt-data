The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values, `x` and `y`. The function then returns these values `x` and `y`, along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The output thus consists of three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. There are no explicit checks for the validity of the results from `func_2`, meaning that if `func_2` produces unexpected values (like non-numeric), this function could lead to errors or undefined behavior. Furthermore, there is no error handling or validation of inputs `a` and `b` before utilizing them in calculations. Therefore, the program state after execution will be based entirely on the outcomes produced by `func_2`, and any error handling relies solely on that function.
