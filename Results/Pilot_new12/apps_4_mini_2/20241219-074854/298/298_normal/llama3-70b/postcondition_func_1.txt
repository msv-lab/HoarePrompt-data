The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a non-negative integer `b`. It performs a recursive computation reflective of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is typically used to find integers x and y such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0), indicating that the gcd of `a` and 0 is `a`, and the coefficients for the equation are 1 and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself with `b` and \( a \mod b \), eventually returning a tuple consisting of the second value from the recursive call and the calculated coefficient for `a`. 

It's important to note that if `b` is negative, the function does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior or infinite recursion. The function should only be called with `b` as a non-negative integer to preserve expected functionality. The end state of the program will be the returned tuple containing the coefficients related to the gcd computation for the initial values of `a` and `b`.
