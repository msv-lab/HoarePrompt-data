The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function performs this calculation by repeatedly updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero. Upon completion, the function returns the GCD, which is the final value of `a`, while the value of `b` is guaranteed to be zero at this point. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative; it assumes that both inputs are positive integers, as stated in the precondition.
