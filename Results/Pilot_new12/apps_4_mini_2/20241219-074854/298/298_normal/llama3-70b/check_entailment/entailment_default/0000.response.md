To analyze the given Python program against the problem description, let's evaluate the code and output hints provided:

The essential requirement is to find three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle they form is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The output also specifies that if it's impossible to find such points, the program should print "NO".

### Code Analysis:

1. **Condition Check:**
    ```python
    if n * m % k:
        print('NO')
        exit()
    ```
   This line checks if the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) can be an integer since if \(n \cdot m \mod k \neq 0\), the desired area is not a whole number and thus it is impossible to find integer points that form such a triangle.

2. **Using `func_3`:**
    ```python
    (n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
    if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
        print('YES')
        print(0, 0)
        print(0, n1 * m // g)
        print(m1 * m // g, 0)
    else:
        print('NO')
    ```
    Here, `func_3(n, m)` is called to find coefficients such that a triangle can be formed as specified. If the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` is satisfied, it prints the triangle's vertices. If not, it returns "NO".

3. **Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`:**
   - **`func_1`:** Calculating GCD of two integers.
   - **`func_2`:** Extended Euclidean algorithm, returning coefficients for the GCD computation which may provide necessary \(x\) and \(y\) for area calculations.
   - **`func_3`:** Uses `func_2` to get \(x\) and \(y\) and compute their linear combination with respect to \(a\) and \(b\).

### Potential Issues:
While the logic seems sound, thereâ€™s an essential detail regarding the logic derived from \((n1, m1, g)\) and the determination of whether it is possible to form the triangle. The hint states that no output is printed if there's no possible configuration for triangle coordinates that match the area. 

However, there might be values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) such that:

- Valid \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) exist, resulting in a valid area calculation, yet yielding no valid triangle points through the current vertex generation logic.

### Conclusion:
Since we cannot guarantee that the coordinates based on the output from `func_3` will be valid for every case when the area can be expressed in whole numbers, and since the output hints indicate a possibility of yielding no triangle points:

- Importantly, there are cases where despite good areas possible, the implementation could still yield "NO" due to the derived coordinates not capturing valid points.

Therefore, given that potential valid cases could still lead to failure in generating appropriate points for the triangle:

Correctness: **False**. 

This assumed behavior from cases where \(n\), \(m\), \(k\) combinations could yield valid areas yet not valid triangle points reinforces that the current code does not strictly assert correctness across all input values.
