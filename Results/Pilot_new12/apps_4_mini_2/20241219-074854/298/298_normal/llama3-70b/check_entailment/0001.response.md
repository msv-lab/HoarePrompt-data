Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description adequately. The problem requires identifying three integer points such that the area of the triangle they form equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \). However, the functions given in the code do not seem to relate to the requirements of calculating triangle areas or determining specific points satisfying the conditions of the problem.

For instance, the area of a triangle formed by points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), and \( (x_3, y_3) \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

The code lacks any such calculation or logical implementation to find suitable points. Therefore, it cannot produce valid output for given inputs. 

Furthermore, since there is no implementation that checks if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) can be a valid area (particularly, if \( nm \) is divisible by \( k \)), we can conclude that the code does not handle all potential cases correctly.

For example, if we take \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( k = 3 \), the expected area would be \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \). However, the functions provided don't predictably yield three integer points that meet this requirement, leading the program to an incorrect conclusion.

In summary, since the code does not compute or return the required triangle area, and does not find points fulfilling the conditions provided in the problem statement, its correctness is deemed to be False.
