To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the requirements and the logic within the program.

### Problem requirements:
1. We need to check if three integer points can be selected such that:
   - \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
   - \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
   - The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
   
2. If such points exist, output "YES" followed by the coordinates of the three points; if not, output "NO".

### Program analysis:
1. **Input and validity check**:
   - The program reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It first checks if \(n \times m\) is divisible by \(k\). If not, it prints "NO".
   - This is indeed necessary because the area of the triangle can only be a whole number if the product \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\).

2. **Point generation**:
   - The program calls `func_3(n, m)` to find coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that they can be used to create the triangle points. This function essentially finds integers \(x\) and \(y\) (using the Extended Euclidean algorithm) and calculates the quantity \(g = x \cdot n + y \cdot m\).
   - The program then checks if the area can be expressed as \( \frac{nm}{k} \) by validating that \(abs(n1 \cdot m) \geq g\).

3. **Output generation**:
   - If all checks pass, it constructs three points:
     - (0, 0)
     - (0, \(n1 \cdot m / g\))
     - (\(m1 \cdot m / g\), 0)
   - These points are designed to ensure the triangle has the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

### Correctness evaluation:
The program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. It includes the necessary checks to ensure that the area can be formed and systematically derives the points based on mathematical properties.

- The check for the divisibility ensures that the calculated area is indeed a whole number when it could be represented as \(nm/k\).
- The use of the Extended Euclidean algorithm allows for generating appropriate integer coefficients to form the desired triangle configuration upon verification that the area condition is fulfilled, leading to the output of point coordinates as specified.

### Conclusion:
Based on the explanation, the program adheres strictly to the problem description and correctly determines whether or not the points satisfying all constraints exist.

Correctness: **True**
