Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues in its logic. 

1. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the expected area of the triangle as \( \frac{nm}{k} \) and correctly checks if \( n \cdot m \) is divisible by \( k \). However, it does not adequately guarantee that the output points will always form a triangle with the desired area. For example, there may be configurations leading to either degenerate triangles (area zero) or triangles that do not satisfy the area constraint due to improper selection of point coordinates.

2. **Point Coordinate Limits**: The code does not properly validate if the coordinates returned by `func_3` actually lie within the limits given in the problem (the points must be in the ranges \( 0 \leq x_i \leq n \) and \( 0 \leq y_i \leq m \)). Specifically, if the values returned by the helper function `func_2` do not yield coordinates that adhere to these constraints, the points will not be valid.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to consider edge cases, such as when \( n \) or \( m \) is very small compared to \( k \). In cases where \( k \) approaches the product \( nm \) but is still a divisor, valid integer coordinates may not exist.

For example, if we input values like \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \), \( k = 2 \), this returns 'YES' with some point calculations that do not adhere to the triangle area requirement because it implies an area of \( 0.5 \), which is impossible to form with integer points. 

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not consistently fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential input values.
