You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description adequately. The problem requires identifying three integer points such that the area of the triangle they form equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \). However, the functions given in the code do not seem to relate to the requirements of calculating triangle areas or determining specific points satisfying the conditions of the problem.

For instance, the area of a triangle formed by points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), and \( (x_3, y_3) \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

The code lacks any such calculation or logical implementation to find suitable points. Therefore, it cannot produce valid output for given inputs. 

Furthermore, since there is no implementation that checks if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) can be a valid area (particularly, if \( nm \) is divisible by \( k \)), we can conclude that the code does not handle all potential cases correctly.

For example, if we take \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( k = 3 \), the expected area would be \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \). However, the functions provided don't predictably yield three integer points that meet this requirement, leading the program to an incorrect conclusion.

In summary, since the code does not compute or return the required triangle area, and does not find points fulfilling the conditions provided in the problem statement, its correctness is deemed to be False.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values, `x` and `y`. The function then returns these values `x` and `y`, along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The output thus consists of three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. There are no explicit checks for the validity of the results from `func_2`, meaning that if `func_2` produces unexpected values (like non-numeric), this function could lead to errors or undefined behavior. Furthermore, there is no error handling or validation of inputs `a` and `b` before utilizing them in calculations. Therefore, the program state after execution will be based entirely on the outcomes produced by `func_2`, and any error handling relies solely on that function.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
