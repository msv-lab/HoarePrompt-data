Final: **True**

The annotated version of the program clarifies its logic and how it addresses the problem description. The program first checks if \( nm \mod k = 0 \) to determine if the area of the triangle can be formed as \( \frac{nm}{k} \). If not, it appropriately outputs "NO". 

Next, it uses the function `func_3` which, through `func_2`, calculates points that are supposed to form the triangle with required properties. The `func_2` is effectively used to derive integer relationships necessary for calculating the coordinates of the triangle based on the greatest common divisor logic. The state of the program at different points indicates that the returned values from `func_3` are integers that would fit within the bounds set by \( n \) and \( m \), and the area checks are properly addressed.

Since the program includes logical checks for the validity of triangle area construction with integer coordinates and limits those properties within the provided constraints, it adheres to the problem's requirement of finding three valid integer points defining a triangle that meets the area condition. 

Thus, the original assessment that declared the program's correctness as False is now deemed inaccurate. The program correctly handles the specified logic and validates the necessary checks, fulfilling the problem description adequately.
