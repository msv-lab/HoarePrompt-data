You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers, where a and b are the two numbers whose greatest common divisor is being calculated.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, indicating the loop has finished executing.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 indicating the calculations have concluded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function performs this calculation by repeatedly updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero. Upon completion, the function returns the GCD, which is the final value of `a`, while the value of `b` is guaranteed to be zero at this point. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative; it assumes that both inputs are positive integers, as stated in the precondition.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where b is non-negative.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where y and x are the outputs of func_2(b, a % b), 'b' is non-negative and greater than 0, and 'a' is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a non-negative integer `b`. It performs a recursive computation reflective of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is typically used to find integers x and y such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0), indicating that the gcd of `a` and 0 is `a`, and the coefficients for the equation are 1 and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself with `b` and \( a \mod b \), eventually returning a tuple consisting of the second value from the recursive call and the calculated coefficient for `a`. 

It's important to note that if `b` is negative, the function does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior or infinite recursion. The function should only be called with `b` as a non-negative integer to preserve expected functionality. The end state of the program will be the returned tuple containing the coefficients related to the gcd computation for the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x and y obtained from func_2(a, b), along with the result of the calculation x * a + y * b, where x is derived from a and b via func_2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values, `x` and `y`. The function then returns these values `x` and `y`, along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The output thus consists of three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. There are no explicit checks for the validity of the results from `func_2`, meaning that if `func_2` produces unexpected values (like non-numeric), this function could lead to errors or undefined behavior. Furthermore, there is no error handling or validation of inputs `a` and `b` before utilizing them in calculations. Therefore, the program state after execution will be based entirely on the outcomes produced by `func_2`, and any error handling relies solely on that function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
