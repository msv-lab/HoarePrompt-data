Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description requirements. Specifically, it does not implement the logic needed to determine whether three integer points can be found such that the area of the triangle they form equals nm/k. 

Additionally, it does not include any conditional checks to assess if the area computed (nm/k) is a valid integer or can actually be represented by integer coordinates within the given constraints. 

For example, if we have inputs n = 4, m = 3, and k = 3, the area would be 4. This might indeed allow for such points, but the provided program logic does not compute or validate this. The program should contain both computations based on these inputs and the generation of points (if valid) based upon calculated coordinates or determine that no such points exist.

Therefore, since there is a failure to meet the problem requirements, the correctness of the implementation is false.
