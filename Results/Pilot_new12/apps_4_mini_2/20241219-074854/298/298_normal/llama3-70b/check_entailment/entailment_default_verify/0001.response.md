Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the problem description's requirements. The code consists of functions that appear to calculate the greatest common divisor and related values, but it does not implement any functionality to compute or validate the area of a triangle formed by three points in a two-dimensional space as described.

The problem specifically asks for three integer points such that the area of the formed triangle equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \). The functions in the code do not address this requirement, lacking logic to derive the coordinates of such points or to check the condition of the area being equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

Moreover, the output hints clarify that while the program may produce values from the `func_2`, there is no correlation with the triangle area or the aspect of finding coordinates that would fulfill the requirements. Thus, the original assessment that the program's correctness is **False** remains accurate as the program does not satisfy the problem's conditions.
