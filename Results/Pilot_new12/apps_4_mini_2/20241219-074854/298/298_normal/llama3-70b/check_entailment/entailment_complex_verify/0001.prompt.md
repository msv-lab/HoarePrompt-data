You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description adequately. The problem requires identifying three integer points such that the area of the triangle they form equals \( \frac{nm}{k} \). However, the functions given in the code do not seem to relate to the requirements of calculating triangle areas or determining specific points satisfying the conditions of the problem.

For instance, the area of a triangle formed by points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), and \( (x_3, y_3) \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

The code lacks any such calculation or logical implementation to find suitable points. Therefore, it cannot produce valid output for given inputs. 

Furthermore, since there is no implementation that checks if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) can be a valid area (particularly, if \( nm \) is divisible by \( k \)), we can conclude that the code does not handle all potential cases correctly.

For example, if we take \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( k = 3 \), the expected area would be \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \). However, the functions provided don't predictably yield three integer points that meet this requirement, leading the program to an incorrect conclusion.

In summary, since the code does not compute or return the required triangle area, and does not find points fulfilling the conditions provided in the problem statement, its correctness is deemed to be False.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers, where a and b are the two numbers whose greatest common divisor is being calculated.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, indicating the loop has finished executing.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 indicating the calculations have concluded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function performs this calculation by repeatedly updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero. Upon completion, the function returns the GCD, which is the final value of `a`, while the value of `b` is guaranteed to be zero at this point. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative; it assumes that both inputs are positive integers, as stated in the precondition.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where b is non-negative.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where y and x are the outputs of func_2(b, a % b), 'b' is non-negative and greater than 0, and 'a' is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a non-negative integer `b`. It performs a recursive computation reflective of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is typically used to find integers x and y such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0), indicating that the gcd of `a` and 0 is `a`, and the coefficients for the equation are 1 and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself with `b` and \( a \mod b \), eventually returning a tuple consisting of the second value from the recursive call and the calculated coefficient for `a`. 

It's important to note that if `b` is negative, the function does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior or infinite recursion. The function should only be called with `b` as a non-negative integer to preserve expected functionality. The end state of the program will be the returned tuple containing the coefficients related to the gcd computation for the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x and y obtained from func_2(a, b), along with the result of the calculation x * a + y * b, where x is derived from a and b via func_2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values, `x` and `y`. The function then returns these values `x` and `y`, along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The output thus consists of three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. There are no explicit checks for the validity of the results from `func_2`, meaning that if `func_2` produces unexpected values (like non-numeric), this function could lead to errors or undefined behavior. Furthermore, there is no error handling or validation of inputs `a` and `b` before utilizing them in calculations. Therefore, the program state after execution will be based entirely on the outcomes produced by `func_2`, and any error handling relies solely on that function.
