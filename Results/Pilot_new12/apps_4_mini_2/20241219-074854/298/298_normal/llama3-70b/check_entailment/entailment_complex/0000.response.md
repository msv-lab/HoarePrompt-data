To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and annotations closely.

### Problem Description Summary:
- Given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, we need to find three integer points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)` such that:
  - \(0 \leq x1, x2, x3 \leq n\)
  - \(0 \leq y1, y2, y3 \leq m\)
  - The area of the triangle formed by these points should equal \(\frac{nm}{k}\).
- If such points exist, print "YES" followed by the coordinates; otherwise, print "NO".

### Code Overview:
1. Checks if \(n \times m\) is not divisible by \(k\). If not divisible, prints "NO" and exits.
2. Calls `func_3(n, m)`, which relies on `func_2` to compute certain values related to the GCD of `n` and `m`.
3. After getting values from `func_3`, it checks if the computed area based on the points can fit within the limits defined by `n` and `m`.
4. If it can, points are printed, otherwise "NO".

### Critical Points in Code:
- The first check of `n * m % k` directly relates to whether it's possible to form the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) as an integer. If this condition doesn't hold, the function correctly identifies that no points can satisfy the area requirement.
- The functions `func_2` and `func_3` utilize the Extended Euclidean Algorithm; however, there are no checks post-invocation for invalid scenarios.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Non-integer Area**: If \(k\) divides \(nm\), the area is calculated correctly; if not, the program early exits. This aligns with the expectations.
2. **Output Conditions**: The generated points from the area calculation must also adhere to the bounds set by `n` and `m`. If the conditions are not met, "NO" is returned.

### Considerations for Failure:
- The potential concern arises if the computation of points allows for an area larger than can be provided by the bounds \(n\) and \(m\). For example, if \(k > nm\) could lead to attempts to generate points from a negative or zero area scenario despite passing the immediate modulus conditions.

### Validity Confirmed by Examples:
- For example, in \(4, 3, 3\), area is 4, and a valid triangle is constructed within bounds, leading to correct output.
- Conversely, in \(4, 4, 7\), producing an area \(\frac{16}{7}\) should explicitly return "NO" which it does.

### Conclusion:
Considering all checks and analyses:
- The program handles cases where the area is non-integer correctly by early exit.
- Potential issues with generating valid points within specified bounds could emerge but seem mitigated by the logic in place.
- Overall behavior matches described requirements.

Thus, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **True**
