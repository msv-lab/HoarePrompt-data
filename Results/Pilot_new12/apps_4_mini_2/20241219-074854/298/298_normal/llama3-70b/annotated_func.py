#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers, where a and b are the two numbers whose greatest common divisor is being calculated.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, indicating the loop has finished executing.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0 indicating the calculations have concluded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function performs this calculation by repeatedly updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero. Upon completion, the function returns the GCD, which is the final value of `a`, while the value of `b` is guaranteed to be zero at this point. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are zero or negative; it assumes that both inputs are positive integers, as stated in the precondition.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where b is non-negative.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns y and x - a // b * y, where y and x are the outputs of func_2(b, a % b), 'b' is non-negative and greater than 0, and 'a' is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a non-negative integer `b`. It performs a recursive computation reflective of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is typically used to find integers x and y such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0), indicating that the gcd of `a` and 0 is `a`, and the coefficients for the equation are 1 and 0. If `b` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself with `b` and \( a \mod b \), eventually returning a tuple consisting of the second value from the recursive call and the calculated coefficient for `a`. 

It's important to note that if `b` is negative, the function does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior or infinite recursion. The function should only be called with `b` as a non-negative integer to preserve expected functionality. The end state of the program will be the returned tuple containing the coefficients related to the gcd computation for the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x and y obtained from func_2(a, b), along with the result of the calculation x * a + y * b, where x is derived from a and b via func_2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain two values, `x` and `y`. The function then returns these values `x` and `y`, along with the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. The output thus consists of three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. There are no explicit checks for the validity of the results from `func_2`, meaning that if `func_2` produces unexpected values (like non-numeric), this function could lead to errors or undefined behavior. Furthermore, there is no error handling or validation of inputs `a` and `b` before utilizing them in calculations. Therefore, the program state after execution will be based entirely on the outcomes produced by `func_2`, and any error handling relies solely on that function.
