The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. After executing the function body, the function returns the values of `x` and `y`, obtained from calling `func_2(a, b)`, along with the result of the calculation `x * a + y * b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return both the values from `func_2(a, b)` and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b` where `x` and `y` are derived values from the input integers `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, returns values from `func_2(a, b)` and computes the result of `x * a + y * b`, where `x` and `y` are derived from `a` and `b`.**
