The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, with the constraint that `b` is non-negative. 

- If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple (1, 0).
- If `b` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself with parameters `(b, a % b)` and then returns the values `y` and `x - a // b * y`, where `y` and `x` are the results of the recursive call.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing specific values based on the value of `b`, handling the case where `b` is zero and performing a recursive calculation otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a non-negative integer. It returns (1, 0) if `b` is 0, and if `b` is greater than 0, it returns calculated values based on recursive calls.**
