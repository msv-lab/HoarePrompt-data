The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. After executing the function body, it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The calculations conclude when `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return their greatest common divisor. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of a and b, where calculations conclude when b is 0.**
