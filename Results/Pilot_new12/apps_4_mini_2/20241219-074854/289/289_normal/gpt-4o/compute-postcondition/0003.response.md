The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, it is implied that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^18. Since there are no conditions or outputs given for the function, we cannot determine the return value or functionality. Therefore, without additional information on the output, we can only state that it operates on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is implied to operate on a positive integer n with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, but no specific output or behavior is defined.**
