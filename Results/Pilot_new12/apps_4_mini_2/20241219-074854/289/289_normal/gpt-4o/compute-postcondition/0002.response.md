The code prints the value of `max_games`, which is previously defined as being in the range of 1 to 59 and equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the value of `max_games` will correspond to the bit length of `n` minus 1.

The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which will be at least 2 bits for `n` = 2 (giving `max_games` = 1) and at most 59 bits for the maximum value of `n` = \(10^{18}\) (giving `max_games` = 58).

The output state is updated to reflect the value of `max_games`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` and the value of `max_games` is printed.**
