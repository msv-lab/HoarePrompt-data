The `max_games` variable is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent the integer `n` in binary, excluding the sign bit. Given that `n` is an input integer in the range 2 to 10^18, this means `n` will always be at least 2. 

The output of `n.bit_length()` for any integer `n` in this range will be between 2 and 60, since the binary representation of 10^18 requires 60 bits. Therefore, `max_games` will be at least 1 and at most 59 because we subtract 1 from the bit length.

Thus, the Output State after executing the code will include the new value of `max_games`, calculated as `max_games = n.bit_length() - 1`, but we do not know the exact value of `max_games` without knowing `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is in the range 1 to 59, equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
