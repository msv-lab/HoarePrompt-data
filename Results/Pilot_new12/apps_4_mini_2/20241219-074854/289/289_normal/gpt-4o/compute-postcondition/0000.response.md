The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is initially a positive integer within the range of 2 to \(10^{18}\), after execution, `n` will hold the value provided by the user as input, given it remains within specified bounds. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18**.
