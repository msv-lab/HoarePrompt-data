You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_games = n.bit_length() - 1
    print(max_games)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of games the winner can participate in during a knockout tournament based on the number of players `n`, but it uses the expression `n.bit_length() - 1` to determine this number.

The bit length of `n` gives the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which does not correspond to the number of games played in the knockout tournament. The logic of the knockout tournament requires careful consideration of the pairing rules based on the already played games, not just a direct calculation from the number of players.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

For `n = 8`, the expected maximum number of games the winner can participate in is `3` (1 game against each of the other 7 players, with the player winning each match, resulting in a total of 3 matches). However, the program would calculate `8.bit_length() - 1`, which gives `3`, suggesting this is correct, but upon further inspection, we need to look at higher values to consider the rules and nuances of player pairing.

For `n = 10`, the expected number of games is `4`, but the calculation 10.bit_length() - 1 gives `3`, which is incorrect based on the described tournament mechanics. Therefore, the logic to derive the maximum number of games is not correct for various test cases, indicating that the program does not fully adhere to the given problem's requirements.

Considering the pairing rules, proper handling for powers of two and larger sets of players must also be taken into account, which the current implementation does not address.


Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from user input, provided it is in the range [2, 10^18]. It computes the maximum number of games that can be played by determining the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, which is derived from the bit length of `n`. The result, `max_games`, which is equal to the number of bits needed to represent `n` minus one, is printed. However, the function does not return any value. It is important to note that the function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., if `n` falls outside the specified range), which could lead to undefined behavior or errors if such cases arise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
