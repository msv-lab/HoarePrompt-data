Correctness: **False**

The program logic incorrectly interprets the problem requirement. The function calculates the maximum number of games for the tournament winner using `n.bit_length() - 1`, which is intended to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. However, this logic does not hold true for all possible values of `n`.

For example:
- If `n` is 3, based on the logic used in the program, it would print `1`, as `3.bit_length()` is `2`, and `2 - 1` equals `1`. However, according to the problem description, the winner should be able to play a maximum of 2 games (beating players 2 and 3).
- If `n` is 10, the output should be `4`, as per the problem description. The function would output `3`, since `10.bit_length()` is `4`, leading to `4 - 1`, which is incorrect given the game pairing logic discussed.

Thus, since there are inputs where the solution fails the problem's requirements, the correctness is determined to be false.
