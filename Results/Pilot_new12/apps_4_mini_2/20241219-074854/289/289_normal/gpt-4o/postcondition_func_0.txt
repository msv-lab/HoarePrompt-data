The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from user input, provided it is in the range [2, 10^18]. It computes the maximum number of games that can be played by determining the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, which is derived from the bit length of `n`. The result, `max_games`, which is equal to the number of bits needed to represent `n` minus one, is printed. However, the function does not return any value. It is important to note that the function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., if `n` falls outside the specified range), which could lead to undefined behavior or errors if such cases arise.
