The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates on a single positive integer `n` which is constrained to the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \). Since the output specification does not provide detailed return values based on conditions or specific cases for `n`, we cannot describe any return cases. 

Given that the specifics of the output are not provided, the functionality of the function cannot be explicitly defined beyond the acceptance of the parameter range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept explicit parameters; however, it operates on a positive integer n within the range 2 to 10^18. Specific return values are not described.**
