The original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect due to several issues with the behavior of the function `func_1`, particularly regarding its handling of the minimum and maximum bounds for the frame.

Upon analyzing the problem description and the annotated code, the following points reaffirm the assessment:

1. **Frame creation conditions**: The conditions in the program imply that a valid frame must have both a minimum height and width of 2 (`frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2` leads to returning `-1`). However, the problem description allows for frames of size 1, which are valid in certain configurations like if there is only one white pixel or if the frame hugs the white pixels tightly, meaning that it is indeed permissible to have a frame of width or height equal to 1.

2. **Handling of bounding box**: The annotated version indicates that the frame is created based on the bounding box around white pixels. It correctly detects the borders but fails to accommodate cases where only edges/vertices of the white pixels should form the frame (i.e., handling for single-pixel frames).

Given these observations, the original assessment correctly identifies a major flaw in the program. The inability to account for frames with a height or width of less than 2 leads to scenarios where valid configurations are improperly dismissed when they could be represented correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
