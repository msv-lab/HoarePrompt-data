Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to meet the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, it determines the bounding rectangle defined by the white pixels, but it does not correctly handle cases where the white pixels are positioned at the borders of the screen. According to the problem, the frame must have a width of 1 pixel and should include all white pixels located on the frame. 

Here is a critical flaw in the logic: the check for the frame's height and width (`if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2`) leads to an early termination if the frame is too small. However, if the frame is only 1 pixel wide, which can happen when white pixels are close to each other, the program returns `-1` instead of constructing a valid frame. 

For example, consider the input:

```
2 4
w.w.
....
```

According to the problem description, a frame should be outputted around the white pixel, resulting in:

```
+w+.
+.+.
```

However, the program will incorrectly conclude this as invalid and output `-1` because the height and width are both less than 2 (the white pixels do not create a full frame). 

Thus, the program does not correctly construct frames for several configurations of white pixels, confirming its correctness as **False**.
