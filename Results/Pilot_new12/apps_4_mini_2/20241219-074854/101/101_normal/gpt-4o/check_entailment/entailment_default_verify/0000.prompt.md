You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and consider the possible edge cases and constraints. 

The function `func_1` is responsible for identifying the boundary of the frame that should encompass all white pixels ('w') and constructing it using '+' characters for the frame. Based on the analysis, we will be looking for cases where the program might fail to correctly create the frame or might produce incorrect output.

### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads the dimensions of the monitor and the screen state.

2. **Finding Frame Boundaries**: 
   - It scans through the screen to find the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels. 
   - The frame is constructed based on these coordinates with the assumption that it will contain at least a width and height of 2, which is not necessarily correct based on the problem description.

3. **Frame Construction**: 
   - The program creates a frame by replacing '.' with '+' along the detected edges of the frame.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: 
   - The program checks whether a frame exists based on the calculated boundaries.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Single White Pixel**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     1 1
     w
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     w
     ```
   - The current code will return -1 because the calculated frame will not meet the minimum size requirement.

2. **Multiple White Pixels But No Frame Space**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     ...
     .w.
     ...
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     ...
     .w.
     ...
     ```
   - Similarly, the code will likely return -1 since there are not enough white pixels to form a frame.

3. **Frame Just Touching Borders**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     2 2
     ww
     ww
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     ++
     ++
     ```
   - The code should handle this case but may produce incorrect output with wrong assumptions on the minimum border size.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not create a valid frame or it returns -1 for cases where a frame could be appropriate based on the smallest enclosing rectangle, it is evident that there are scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem. 

Because of these potential issues in handling frames, especially with boundaries defined by the presence and arrangement of white pixels, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, and a list of strings, `screen`, where each string consists of characters `'.'` and `'w'`, ensuring that at least one `'w'` is present in the list. It analyzes the positions of `'w'` characters in the `screen` to determine the bounding rectangle defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of these characters. If the height or width of this rectangle (frame) is less than 2, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns a modified version of `screen` where the borders of the rectangle are marked with `'+'`, specifically at the indices corresponding to the found bounding rectangle. The returned frame includes all characters within the rectangle but updates only the border positions to have `'+'` instead of `'.'`. Note that the function does not validate that `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, and it assumes the presence of at least one `'w'`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
