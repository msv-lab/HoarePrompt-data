To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and consider the possible edge cases and constraints. 

The function `func_1` is responsible for identifying the boundary of the frame that should encompass all white pixels ('w') and constructing it using '+' characters for the frame. Based on the analysis, we will be looking for cases where the program might fail to correctly create the frame or might produce incorrect output.

### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads the dimensions of the monitor and the screen state.

2. **Finding Frame Boundaries**: 
   - It scans through the screen to find the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels. 
   - The frame is constructed based on these coordinates with the assumption that it will contain at least a width and height of 2, which is not necessarily correct based on the problem description.

3. **Frame Construction**: 
   - The program creates a frame by replacing '.' with '+' along the detected edges of the frame.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: 
   - The program checks whether a frame exists based on the calculated boundaries.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Single White Pixel**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     1 1
     w
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     w
     ```
   - The current code will return -1 because the calculated frame will not meet the minimum size requirement.

2. **Multiple White Pixels But No Frame Space**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     ...
     .w.
     ...
     ```
   - Expected Output: 
     ```
     ...
     .w.
     ...
     ```
   - Similarly, the code will likely return -1 since there are not enough white pixels to form a frame.

3. **Frame Just Touching Borders**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     2 2
     ww
     ww
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     ++
     ++
     ```
   - The code should handle this case but may produce incorrect output with wrong assumptions on the minimum border size.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not create a valid frame or it returns -1 for cases where a frame could be appropriate based on the smallest enclosing rectangle, it is evident that there are scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem. 

Because of these potential issues in handling frames, especially with boundaries defined by the presence and arrangement of white pixels, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**.
