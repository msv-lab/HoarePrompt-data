You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step and consider edge cases.

The problem requires us to print a frame that surrounds all 'w' pixels on a black screen (represented by '.') with '+' characters. The frame must maintain 'w' pixels unchanged and should be the smallest possible one that encompasses all 'w' pixels.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:** 
   - The screen size is read as `n` and `m`, followed by reading `n` lines of strings that represent pixels on the screen.

2. **Finding Frame Bounds:**
   - The program loops through the screen to find the coordinates of the outermost 'w' pixels:
     - `top`: the smallest row index containing 'w'.
     - `bottom`: the largest row index containing 'w'.
     - `left`: the smallest column index containing 'w'.
     - `right`: the largest column index containing 'w'.
   - If no 'w' pixels are found, it returns -1.

3. **Validation for Frame Size:**
   - It checks if the height and width of the frame (determined by the indices found) are at least 2. If not, it returns -1.

4. **Constructing the Frame:**
   - A new result array is created based on the original screen.
   - The outer 'frame' is populated with '+' for positions that were initially '.' and fall on the border defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

### Potential Case for Failure

The program fails to account for several conditions:
- **Single Pixel 'w':** 
   If the only 'w' pixel forms a frame of size 1 (being the only pixel), it should return the original screen, as nothing else can be framed. The current program incorrectly identifies that the frame should be at least size 2.
  
- **Multiple 'w's in Non-rectangular arrangement:** 
   If 'w' pixels can have holes or surrounded by other 'w's, it should also ensure it correctly determines the bounds for an encompassing rectangle.

#### Example Test Case
An example to demonstrate failure:

Input:
```
3 3
...
.w.
...
```

Expected output:
```
...
.w.
...
```

Current program output: 
```
-1
```
The program incorrectly outputs -1 instead of returning the unchanged screen because it does not count a frame when the minimal frame requirement is not met.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle the case where there is a single white pixel or the minimal framed conditions correctly, we have found a specific edge case where it operates incorrectly.

Thus, the correctness evaluation of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and screen is a list of strings where each string has a length of m and consists of characters either '.' or 'w', ensuring at least one 'w' is present in the list.
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `n` and `m` are positive integers with at least one 'w' present in `screen`.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', and none of the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` are None. Additionally, `n` and `m` are positive integers with at least one 'w' present in `screen`.
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that either the frame height is less than 2 or the frame width is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` has the frame defined by indices from `top` to `bottom` and from `left` to `right` updated with '+', specifically at the border positions represented by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`; `frame_height` is the original value, equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is the original value, equal to `right - left + 1`.
    return result
    #The program returns the frame defined by indices from 'top' to 'bottom' and from 'left' to 'right', which is updated with '+' at the border positions represented by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, and a list of strings, `screen`, where each string consists of characters `'.'` and `'w'`, ensuring that at least one `'w'` is present in the list. It analyzes the positions of `'w'` characters in the `screen` to determine the bounding rectangle defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of these characters. If the height or width of this rectangle (frame) is less than 2, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns a modified version of `screen` where the borders of the rectangle are marked with `'+'`, specifically at the indices corresponding to the found bounding rectangle. The returned frame includes all characters within the rectangle but updates only the border positions to have `'+'` instead of `'.'`. Note that the function does not validate that `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, and it assumes the presence of at least one `'w'`.
