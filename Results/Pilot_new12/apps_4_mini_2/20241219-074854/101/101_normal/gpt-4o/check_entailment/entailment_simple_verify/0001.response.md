Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified a flaw in the program: it fails to return the correct output for cases where there is only a single 'w' pixel or when the smallest frame cannot reach the minimum height and width as specified. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines that at least a frame size of 2 is necessary, and thus outputs -1 instead of returning the unchanged screen. 

The annotated code confirms the same issue, where the checks for `frame_height` and `frame_width` being less than 2 result in an erroneous output in valid scenarios. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program's correctness is indeed false.
