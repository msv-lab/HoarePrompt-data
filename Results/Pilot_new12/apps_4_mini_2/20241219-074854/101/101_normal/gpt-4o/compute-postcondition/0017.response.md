Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains 0, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to the value of `j`, while `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is still 'w'. The current value of `j` is greater than `right`.***
