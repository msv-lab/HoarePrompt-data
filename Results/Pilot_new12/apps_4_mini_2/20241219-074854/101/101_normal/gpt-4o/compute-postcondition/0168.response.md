Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is equal to `left`. If `result[i][j]` is a '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, there is no change to `result[i][j]`.***
