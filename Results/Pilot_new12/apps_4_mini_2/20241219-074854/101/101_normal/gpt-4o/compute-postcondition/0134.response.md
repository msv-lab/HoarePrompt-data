`top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` remains 2, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` remains 2, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1.**
