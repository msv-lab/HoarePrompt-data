The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to both `top` and `bottom`. The previous values of `top` and `bottom` are both 1, and `i` is also 1. After this statement, `top` becomes 1 and `bottom` becomes 1, which were their original values. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `left`, `right`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `right` is 2, `j` is 2, and that `m` is greater than 1 still hold true.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` can change based on `j`, `right` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1.**
