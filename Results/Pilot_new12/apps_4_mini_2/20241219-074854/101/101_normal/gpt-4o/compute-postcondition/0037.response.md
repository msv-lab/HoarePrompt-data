The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that `j` was previously incremented by 1, both `left` and `right` will now equal the new value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `bottom`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
