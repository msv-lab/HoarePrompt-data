The loop processes a 2D list, `screen`, to determine the smallest and largest indices (both row and column) of the character 'w'. The initial conditions guarantee that there is at least one 'w' present in the list, ensuring that during execution, the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will be updated based on the occurrences of 'w'.

After all iterations of the loop finish executing:

- `top` will hold the minimum row index where 'w' is found.
- `bottom` will hold the maximum row index where 'w' is found.
- `left` will hold the minimum column index where 'w' is found.
- `right` will hold the maximum column index where 'w' is found.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged, reflecting the original dimensions of `screen`.

Given that there is at least one 'w' present in `screen`, the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will contain valid indices within the bounds defined by `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `n` and `m` are positive integers with at least one 'w' present in `screen`.**
