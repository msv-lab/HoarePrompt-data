The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` is stated to be less than `left`, which means `j` is less than its new value after assignment. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `left` now has the value equal to `j`, that `j` is less than the updated value of `left`, and the original conditions involving `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom` still stand.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `right` are unchanged; `left` is equal to `j`, and `j` is less than `left`.**
