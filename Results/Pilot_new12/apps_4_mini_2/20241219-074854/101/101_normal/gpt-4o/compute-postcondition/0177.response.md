Postcondition: ***`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is greater than or equal to 3, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2. If the current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, and the current value of `j` is either equal to `left` or `right`, then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+' if it was originally '.'; otherwise, its value remains unchanged.***
