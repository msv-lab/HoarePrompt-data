The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. All other variables maintain their previous states: `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `i`, and `current value of screen[i][j]` remain unchanged. The only change is that `right` is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains 0, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to the value of `j`, while `right` is equal to `j`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is still 'w'.**
