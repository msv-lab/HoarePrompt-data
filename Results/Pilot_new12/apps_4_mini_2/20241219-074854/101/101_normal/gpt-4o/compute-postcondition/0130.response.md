Postcondition: ***`top` can remain None or unchanged. If `top` is 2, then `bottom` remains 2, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, with `i` being 2, `j` being 1, and `m` being greater than 1. If `top` is 2 and `j` is less than `left` and greater than `right`, then `i` is greater than 2, `left` is set to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. If `top` does not meet these conditions (being None, greater than 2, or the conditions involving `j` are not met), then all variables (`bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged.***
