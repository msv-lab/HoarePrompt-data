According to the code, the for loop is controlled by the variables `left` and `right`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `right + 1`, meaning it has reached the end of the range. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `right + 1` from its previous value. Since `j` cannot equal `left` or `right` at this state, we need `j` to be `right + 1` and outside of the current limits defined by `left` and `right`.

Since `j` is currently `right + 1`, it indicates the loop has finished iterating through `left` to `right`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should move to `right + 1`. The relevant boundaries confirm with `left` and `right` leading the states. The unchanged values of `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain valid.

Finally, to reiterate, `left` can still be less than or equal to `right`, and `right` remains unchanged as well as `top` and `bottom` values.

State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is greater than or equal to 3, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `right + 1`**
