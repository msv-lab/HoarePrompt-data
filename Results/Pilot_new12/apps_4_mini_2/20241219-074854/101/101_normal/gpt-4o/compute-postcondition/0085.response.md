The variable `left` is assigned the value of `right`, which is currently 2, and then `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 2 as well. Therefore, after executing the code, both `left` and `right` will have the value of 2. The variables `n`, `m`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1.**
