Postcondition: ***`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is greater than or equal to 3, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `right + 1`. If `i` equals `top` or `bottom` or if `j` equals `left` or `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is equal to '.', `result[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'; otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
