Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `right` is `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, `i` is 1, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to `j`; if not, the value of `left` remains unchanged.***
