The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. Given the initial state, `j` has the value of 2. Since `i` is greater than `bottom`, the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `j`, and `m` are updated accordingly. The value of `left` changes from 1 to 2 (the value of `j`).

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1.**
