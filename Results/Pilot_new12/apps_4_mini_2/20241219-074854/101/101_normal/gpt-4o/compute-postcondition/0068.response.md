Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged. If `top` is None, then `top` is set to 1, `bottom` is set to 1, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the value at `screen[1][0]` equals 'w'. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is set to `j`; if `j` is not greater than `right`, `left` remains unchanged, and `j` is ensured not to be less than `left`.***
