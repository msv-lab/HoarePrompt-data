Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains 0, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`, and the values of `left`, `right`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the value of `j` is less than `left`.***
