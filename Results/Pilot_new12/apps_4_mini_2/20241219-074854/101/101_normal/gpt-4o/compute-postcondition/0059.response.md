Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged. If `i` is less than `top`, then `i` remains less than `top` after execution. The current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.***
