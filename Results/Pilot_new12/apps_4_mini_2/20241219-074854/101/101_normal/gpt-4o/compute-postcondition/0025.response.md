The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and the unchanged variables remain the same, while `top` now takes the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value for `top` and specifies that `i` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is `i`; `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; `i` is unchanged; `j` is `m`.**
