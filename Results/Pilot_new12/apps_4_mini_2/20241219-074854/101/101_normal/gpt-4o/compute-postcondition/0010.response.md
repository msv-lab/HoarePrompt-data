Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` remains 0, and the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute, so these values persist as stated.***
