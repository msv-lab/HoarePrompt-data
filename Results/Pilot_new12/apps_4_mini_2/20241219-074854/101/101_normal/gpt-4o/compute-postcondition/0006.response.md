The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, we can directly substitute that value into the output state. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, and the state of `screen[i][j]` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings with at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
