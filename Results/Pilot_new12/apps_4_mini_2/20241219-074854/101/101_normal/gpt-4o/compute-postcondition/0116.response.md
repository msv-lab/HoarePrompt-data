Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged or can be updated based on 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top` is set to 2, `bottom` remains 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. Otherwise, if `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is 2, `left` is updated to 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0, with `n` being greater than 2 and `m` being greater than or equal to 1, and if `j` is greater than `right`, it is considered; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
