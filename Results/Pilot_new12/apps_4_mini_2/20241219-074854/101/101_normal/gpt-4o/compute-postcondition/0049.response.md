According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the loop index `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` equals 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1. Consequently, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain unchanged as they only update when at least one 'w' is found in the current row (which is row `i`). However, since the previous iteration did not indicate any changes to these values, they will stay as they are.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**
