Postcondition: ***`top` can either be 2 or remain unchanged (None), `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2 or remain unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `top` is set to 2, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are 2, `i` remains 2, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged.***
