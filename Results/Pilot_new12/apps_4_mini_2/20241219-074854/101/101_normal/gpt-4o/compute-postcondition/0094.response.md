Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. If `top` is None, then `left` is set to 2, and `right` remains 2. Otherwise, since `j` is not greater than `right`, `right` remains 2, while `left` is also 2, maintaining that `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2, with `m` being greater than 1.***
