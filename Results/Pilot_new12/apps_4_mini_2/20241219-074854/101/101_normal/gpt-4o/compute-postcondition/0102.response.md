The code assigns the values of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is initially 0, both `left` and `right` will be updated to 0. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `screen[i][j]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
