The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `1`, the value of `bottom` will now be `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` can change based on `j`, `right` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1.**
