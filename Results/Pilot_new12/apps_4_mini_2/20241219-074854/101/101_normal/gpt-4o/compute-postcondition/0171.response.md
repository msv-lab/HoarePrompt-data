According to the code, the loop is designed to execute for each value of `i` from `top` to `bottom`, inclusive. Given that `bottom` is at least `top + 1` (since `bottom >= top + 1`), the loop has already iterated through at least one value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `bottom`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to `bottom + 1`, which must be within the range allowed by the loop. However, since the loop condition is `for i in range(top, bottom + 1)`, once `i` reaches `bottom`, `i` cannot increase any further unless `bottom` is increased for another iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, `bottom` must be increased to at least `bottom + 1`, thereby allowing the loop to continue for one additional iteration with `i` taking the value of `bottom + 1`.

State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` must be greater than or equal to 3 (to accommodate `bottom + 1`), `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` remains greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` remains greater than or equal to 2**
