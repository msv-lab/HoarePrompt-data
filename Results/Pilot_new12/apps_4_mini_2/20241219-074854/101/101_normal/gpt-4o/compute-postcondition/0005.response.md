The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since `i` is initially `0`, both `top` and `bottom` will be set to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings with at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings with at least one 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**.
