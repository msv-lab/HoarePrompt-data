The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1, and `bottom` is also assigned the value of `i`, so `bottom` also becomes 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and the value of `top` now becomes equal to `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the value at `screen[1][0]` equals 'w'.**
