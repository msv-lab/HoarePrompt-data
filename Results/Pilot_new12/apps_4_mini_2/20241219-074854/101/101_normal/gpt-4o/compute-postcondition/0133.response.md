In the given code, both `left` and `right` are assigned the value of `j`. The initial value of `j` is 2. Therefore, both `left` and `right` will now be set to 2. We must keep track of the other variables which remain unchanged.

Hereâ€™s the updated state of the variables:

- `top` remains 2
- `bottom` remains 2
- `left` is now 2 (previously 1)
- `right` is now 2 (previously 1)
- `i` remains 2
- `j` remains 2
- `m` is still greater than 1

Thus, the Output State is: `top` is 2; `bottom` is 2; `left` is 2; `right` is 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `m` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`top` is 2; `bottom` is 2; `left` is 2; `right` is 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `m` is greater than 1.**
