According to the provided code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. The loop will continue to execute for `i` as long as it is less than `n`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

If `i` is increased from 1 to 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

Thus, the updated states will be:
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` can either remain unchanged if 'w' is not found again in row `i`, or they may be assigned new values if 'w' is found.
- The index `i` should be updated to 2 and `j` remains equal to `m-1`.

State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged or can be updated based on 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is `m-1`, and `n` must be greater than 2**.
