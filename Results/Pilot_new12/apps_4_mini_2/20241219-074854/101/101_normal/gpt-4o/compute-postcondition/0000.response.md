The code snippet initializes the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to `None`. The initial state does not specify any values for these variables, and as such, we can conclude that they will all be assigned the value `None`. The other variables, `n`, `m`, and `screen`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings where each string has a length of `m` and consists of characters either '.' or 'w', ensuring at least one 'w' is present in the list; `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None.**
