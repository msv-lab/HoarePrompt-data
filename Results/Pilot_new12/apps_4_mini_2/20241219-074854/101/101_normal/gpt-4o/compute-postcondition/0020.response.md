Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. `screen` is a list of strings with at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to 0, while `i` and `j` remain 0, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is still 'w'. If `top` is not None, `top` remains 0 and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j`, while `bottom`, `left`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is still 'w'.***
