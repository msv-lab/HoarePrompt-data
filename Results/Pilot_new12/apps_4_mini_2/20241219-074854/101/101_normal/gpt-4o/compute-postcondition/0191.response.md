The code assigns the value `'+'` to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `result` array. The conditions state that `result[i][j]` was previously `'.'`, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Hence, the output state reflects the updated value of `result[i][j]`.

Output State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is greater than or equal to 3, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `left`, `i` is either equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` equals `left`, or `j` equals `right`; `result[i][j]` is '+'**
