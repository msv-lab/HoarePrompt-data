The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is equal to `m` and both `left` and `right` are being updated, their new values will be equal to `m`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `bottom`, `top` and `bottom` are equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `m`, `right` is equal to `m`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `m`.**
