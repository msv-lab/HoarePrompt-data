The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to both `top` and `bottom`. The previous value of `bottom` is 2, and `i` is 2. Therefore, after the execution, both `top` and `bottom` will be set to 2. The variable `left`, `right`, `j`, and `m` are not affected in this code. 

Output State: **`top` is 2; `bottom` is 2; `left` is 1; `right` is 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `m` is greater than 1.**
