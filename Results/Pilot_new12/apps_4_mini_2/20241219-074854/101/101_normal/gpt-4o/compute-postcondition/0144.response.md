Output State: **`top` is the minimum value of `i` where `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `bottom` is the maximum value of `i` where `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `left` is the minimum value of `j` where `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `right` is the maximum value of `j` where `screen[i][j]` is 'w', with `n` being greater than 2 and `m` being greater than or equal to 1. If no 'w' is found, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.**
