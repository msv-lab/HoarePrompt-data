The value at `result[i][j]` is assigned the character `'+'`. The variable `j` is specifically defined as `right + 1`, meaning that the position for the assignment is determined based on the `right` value. Since `result` is being modified at the index `[i][j]`, the other variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged in their conditions, but the content of `result` is updated.

The output state reflects that the character `'+'` is placed at a specific location in the `result` array based on the values of `i` and `j`. 

Output State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `right + 1`, and `result[i][j]` is set to '+'**.
