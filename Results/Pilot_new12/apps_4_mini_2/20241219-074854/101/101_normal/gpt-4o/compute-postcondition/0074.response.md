Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `i` is less than `top`, the program maintains the state with `n`, `m`, `screen`, and the unchanged variables, adhering to the conditions set in the precondition.***
