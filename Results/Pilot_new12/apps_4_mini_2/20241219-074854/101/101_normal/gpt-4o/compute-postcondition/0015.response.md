The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is known to be less than `left` since `j` is specified to be less than `left`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `left` now takes the new value of `j`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains 0, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
