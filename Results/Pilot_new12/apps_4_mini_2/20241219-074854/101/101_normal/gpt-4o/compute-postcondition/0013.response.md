Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` remains 0, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `left`, `right`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.***
