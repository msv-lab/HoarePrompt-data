According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer, the loop can execute. Additionally, the loop variable `j` will start at 0 and go up to `m - 1`. 

At the start of the loop, the states that need to be established are:
- `j` will take on the values from `0` to `m - 1`. 
- Given there is no additional context in the loop body, other variables like `n`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's execution.

Additionally, we need to acknowledge that since `i` is currently 0, it could be used in the loop body, but it does not influence whether the loop executes.

Thus, before the loop starts, we confirm the following states:
- `j` starts at 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings with at least one 'w', `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
