Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is set to the value of `j`, while `left`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `right`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `j` remains unchanged.***
