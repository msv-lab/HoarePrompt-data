After executing the code, both `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Therefore, both `top` and `bottom` will now be equal to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` and `right` are unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1.**
