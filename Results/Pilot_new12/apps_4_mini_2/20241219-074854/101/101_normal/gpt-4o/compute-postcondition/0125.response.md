The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. If `top` is 2, it is explicitly stated that `i` is greater than `bottom`, which is 2. Therefore, the value of `i` is greater than 2. However, since the values of `bottom`, `right`, and `m` remain unchanged, they hold their previous values. The state of the variables `top` and `j` also remains unchanged unless it is specified.

Since we do not have any specific values for `j`, `bottom`, `right`, or `m`, we will state them as unchanged. Thus, the Output State captures all relevant information following the code execution.

Output State: **If `top` is 2, then `i` is greater than `bottom`, which is 2; `left` is assigned the value of `j`; values of `bottom`, `right`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
