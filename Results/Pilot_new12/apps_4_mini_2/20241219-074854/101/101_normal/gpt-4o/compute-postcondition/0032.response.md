Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, and `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is assigned the value of `j` while `left` remains unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged and `left` also remains unchanged.***
