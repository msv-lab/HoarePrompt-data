The variable `top` is assigned the value of `bottom` and `i`. Since it is stated that `top`, `bottom`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given initial state, the output will specify the values held by those variables. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `screen`, `left`, `right`, and `j`, remain unchanged with respect to this operation. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is equal to `bottom`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` remains as it was, `right` remains as it was, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
