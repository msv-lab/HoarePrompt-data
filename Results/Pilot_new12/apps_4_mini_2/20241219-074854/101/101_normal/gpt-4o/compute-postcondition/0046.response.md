Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `j` has been incremented by 1. If `top` is None, then `top` is equal to `bottom`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is set to the value of `j`, while `left`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `right`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged and `j` remains unchanged.***
