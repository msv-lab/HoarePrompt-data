The assignment `left = j` means that the value of `j` will be assigned to `left`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. However, the variable `left` will now have the same value as `j`.

So, after executing this line of code, the output state reflects that `left` is now equal to the value of `j`, while other variables and their conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `left` is equal to `j`.**
