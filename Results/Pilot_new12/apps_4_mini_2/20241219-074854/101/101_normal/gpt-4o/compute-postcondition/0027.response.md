In the given code snippet, `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and that `i` is less than `top`, meaning `top` is set to `i`. The values of `left`, `right`, and the unchanged variables remain the same. The variable `j` remains equal to `m`, while `bottom` is updated to equal `i`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `bottom` as well as maintains all other relevant states.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'; `top` is set to `i`; `bottom` is equal to `i`; `left` is unchanged; `right` is unchanged; `i` is unchanged; `j` is equal to `m`.**
