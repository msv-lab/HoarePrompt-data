The code assigns the values of both `top` and `bottom` to the value of `i`, which is `2`. The previous values of `top` and `bottom` were `None` and unchanged, respectively. After execution, both `top` and `bottom` are now `2`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` and `right` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
