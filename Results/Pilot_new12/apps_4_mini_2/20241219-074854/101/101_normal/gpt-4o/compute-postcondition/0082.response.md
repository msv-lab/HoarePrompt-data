Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` remains 1, `bottom` remains 1, `left` and `right` can change based on the value of `j`. Specifically, `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than its previous value, `left` is updated to `j` if `j` is less than its previous value, and `m` remains greater than 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 1. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', there are no changes made to the variables.***
