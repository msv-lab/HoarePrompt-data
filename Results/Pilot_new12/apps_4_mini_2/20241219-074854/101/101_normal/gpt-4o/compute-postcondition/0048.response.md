Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If at least one 'w' is found in the row `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will contain the smallest and largest row and column indices of the 'w' characters in that row. If no 'w' is found in row `i`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain unchanged from their original values (which are None). If at least one 'w' is found, `i` will still be equal to its initial value (0), and `j` will have reached `m`.**
