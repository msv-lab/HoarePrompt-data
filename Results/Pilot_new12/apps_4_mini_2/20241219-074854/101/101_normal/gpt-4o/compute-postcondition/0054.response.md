The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. In the initial state, `j` is 0, so after the code executes, both `left` and `right` will also become 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the value at `screen[1][0]` equals 'w'.**
