To determine the new state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

Currently, we know:
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`
- `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2

For the for loop:
```
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that the loop iterates over `j` starting from `left` up to `right`, inclusive.

1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `right` (the last index covered by the loop).
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Thus, `j` will become `right + 1`.
3. The loop condition involves `j` being within the range `left` to `right`, which means to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `right`. Therefore, for the next execution, `right` must be at least `right + 1`, which doesn't satisfy this directly unless the loop does not execute if `j` exceeds `right`.

Given that `left` remains unchanged, and we need to ensure that `j` can still be valid for the next iteration given the context of the loop. 

State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is `right + 1`**
