Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` and `result[i][j]` is '.', the element in the result array at position `i`, `j` is updated to a plus sign ('+').***
