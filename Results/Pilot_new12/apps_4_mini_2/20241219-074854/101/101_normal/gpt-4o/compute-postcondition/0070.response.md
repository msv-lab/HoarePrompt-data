According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` compared to `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue requires that `j` is less than `m`, which means `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1**
