Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom` must satisfy `bottom >= top + 1`, `left`, `right` must satisfy `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is now `top`, `j` is now `left`. The value of `i` is either equal to `top` or `bottom`, the value of `j` is either equal to `left` or `right`. The current value of `result[i][j]` is '.', indicating that the element in the result array at position `i`, `j` is equal to a period.***
