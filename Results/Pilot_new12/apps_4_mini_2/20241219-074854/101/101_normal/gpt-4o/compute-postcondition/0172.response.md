According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `left` and `right`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting point (`left`) must be less than or equal to the ending point (`right + 1`). 

Hereâ€™s the analysis:

1. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `left`.
2. It iterates as long as `j` is less than or equal to `right`.
3. This means that for the loop to run, the condition `left <= right` needs to be satisfied.

Given the states mentioned:
- `top` remains unchanged.
- `bottom` must be greater than or equal to 3 (affects `bottom + 1`).
- `left` remains unchanged.
- `right` remains unchanged.
- `frame_height` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` remains greater than or equal to 2.

To ensure the loop can execute:
- We must ensure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

Thus, the conditions can be summarized as follows:

State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` must be greater than or equal to 3, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` must be greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` must be greater than or equal to 2**
