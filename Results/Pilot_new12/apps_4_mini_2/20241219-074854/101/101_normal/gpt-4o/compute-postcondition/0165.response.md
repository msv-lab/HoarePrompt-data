Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is `right + 1`. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is equal to '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'.***
