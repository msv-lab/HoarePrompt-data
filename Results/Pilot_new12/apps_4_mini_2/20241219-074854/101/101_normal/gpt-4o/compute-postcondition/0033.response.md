Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, and `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are set to `i`, `left` is set to `m`, and `right` is also set to `m`. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is assigned the value of `j`, while `left` remains unchanged. If `j` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` and `left` both remain unchanged.***
