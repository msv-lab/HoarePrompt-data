Postcondition: ***`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged or can be updated based on 'w'; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `n` is greater than 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is 2, and `i` is not greater than `bottom` anymore. The current value of `j` is 0, and it is less than `left`.***
