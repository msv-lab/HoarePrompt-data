The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is greater than `right` according to the initial precondition, `right` is updated to this new value of `j`, reflecting that `right` now holds the value of `j`. The conditions involving `left` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the current operation.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `left` remains unchanged, `right` is equal to `j`**.
