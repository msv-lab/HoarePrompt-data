The variable `frame_height` is assigned the value of `bottom - top + 1`. Given that `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined and none are None, we can conclude that `frame_height` will reflect the number of rows spanned by the indices of `w`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; only `frame_height` is affected.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `n` and `m` are positive integers with at least one 'w' present in `screen`.**
