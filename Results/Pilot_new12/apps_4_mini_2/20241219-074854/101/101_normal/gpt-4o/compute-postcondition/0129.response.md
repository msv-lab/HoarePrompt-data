Postcondition: ***`top` can be None or unchanged. If `top` is 2, then `bottom` remains 2, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. Otherwise, if `top` is 2, `j` is less than `left`, and `j` is greater than `right`, then `i` is greater than 2, `left` is assigned the value of `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. If `top` is None, greater than 2, or if the conditions involving `j` are not met, then all variables (`bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged.***
