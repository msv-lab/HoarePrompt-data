According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `top` and `bottom`. The loop iterates from `top` to `bottom`, inclusive. Given that at the end of the last iteration `bottom` is greater than or equal to 3, we require that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `i` must be equal to either `top` or `bottom`. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should equal `bottom + 1`. 

Thus, if `bottom` is unchanged and continues to be greater than or equal to 3, and assuming `top` remains unchanged, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `bottom + 1`. The same conditions still need to hold: `bottom` remains greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is greater than or equal to 3, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`**
