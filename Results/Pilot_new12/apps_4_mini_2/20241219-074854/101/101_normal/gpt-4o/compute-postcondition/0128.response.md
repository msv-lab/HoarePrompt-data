Postcondition: ***If `top` is 2 and `j < left` and `j` is greater than `right`, then `i` is greater than 2, `left` is assigned the value of `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. If `top` is None or greater than 2, or if `j` is not less than `left`, or if `j` is not greater than `right`, then all variables (`bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged.***
