Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i`, and if `i` is less than `top`, `i` remains less than `top` after execution, ensuring that the current value of `i` is greater than the new `bottom. The current value of `j` is less than `left`.***
