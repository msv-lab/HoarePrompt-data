The variable `frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. The specific values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` were not provided, but based on the context, `frame_width` will be calculated based on those variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width = right - left + 1`.

Output State: **`top` is the minimum row index of 'w', `bottom` is the maximum row index of 'w', `left` is the minimum column index of 'w', `right` is the maximum column index of 'w', `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width = right - left + 1`.**
