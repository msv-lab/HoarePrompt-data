Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, and a list of strings, `screen`, where each string consists of characters `'.'` and `'w'`, ensuring that at least one `'w'` is present in the list. It analyzes the positions of `'w'` characters in the `screen` to determine the bounding rectangle defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of these characters. If the height or width of this rectangle (frame) is less than 2, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns a modified version of `screen` where the borders of the rectangle are marked with `'+'`, specifically at the indices corresponding to the found bounding rectangle. The returned frame includes all characters within the rectangle but updates only the border positions to have `'+'` instead of `'.'`. Note that the function does not validate that `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, and it assumes the presence of at least one `'w'`.**
