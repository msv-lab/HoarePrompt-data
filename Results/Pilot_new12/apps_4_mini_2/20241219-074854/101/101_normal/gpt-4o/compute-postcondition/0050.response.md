According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute `m` times as long as `m` is a positive integer. Since `n` and `m` are both stated to be positive integers, and `i` is set to 1 at the start, there is nothing that needs adjusting for `i` to allow the loop to execute. Additionally, the variable `j` will start at 0 on the first iteration of the loop. 

The relevant states for the loop execution are:
- `m` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied.
- `j` will start at 0 on the first iteration.

Therefore, no modifications are necessary for the existing states. However, I will restate the context for clarity.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
