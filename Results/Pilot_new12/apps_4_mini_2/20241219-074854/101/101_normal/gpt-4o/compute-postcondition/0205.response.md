The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. Here are the descriptions of the parameters and the output based on the defined cases:

1. `n` is a positive integer representing the height of the screen, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000.
2. `m` is a positive integer representing the width of the screen, with the constraint that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000.
3. `screen` is a list of strings, where each string has a length of `m` and consists of characters either '.' or 'w', ensuring that at least one 'w' is present in the list.

The outputs are as follows:
- Case_1: The function returns -1 when certain conditions are met.
- Case_2: The function also returns -1, indicating that either the frame height (n) is less than 2 or the frame width (m) is less than 2.
- Case_3: The function returns a frame defined by indices from 'top' to 'bottom' and from 'left' to 'right', which is updated with '+' at the border positions defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m`, along with a list of strings `screen`, and, depending on the validity of `n` and `m`, it either returns -1 for invalid configurations or constructs and returns a framed representation of the `screen`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and m, and a list of strings screen. It returns -1 if the frame height or width is less than 2; otherwise, it returns a framed version of the screen with borders marked by '+'.**
