Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged with `i` set to 1 and `j` set to 0. If the value at `screen[1][0]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, `top` is set to 1 and `bottom` is also set to 1; otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, `right` is updated to `j`, ensuring `j` is not less than `left`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, `left` remains unchanged.***
