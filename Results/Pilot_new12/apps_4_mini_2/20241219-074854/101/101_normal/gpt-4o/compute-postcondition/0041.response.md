Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` is updated to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `j` remains unchanged.***
