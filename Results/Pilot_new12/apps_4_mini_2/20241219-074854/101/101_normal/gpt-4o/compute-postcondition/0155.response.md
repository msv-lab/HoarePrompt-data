According to the code provided, the loop iterates over the range defined by `top` and `bottom`. For the loop to execute at least once, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`. Given that `frame_height` is defined as `bottom - top + 1` and must be at least 2 (i.e., `frame_height >= 2`), we can infer that `bottom` must be at least one greater than `top`. 

Thus, we need to ensure:
1. `bottom` is greater than or equal to `top + 1`. This guarantees that the frame height is at least 2.
2. The starting value of `i` will be `top`.

Since `top` holds the minimum row index of 'w', it implies that it is defined correctly and suitable for the loop. Therefore, as the final necessary conditions, `i` should be initialized to `top`.

The states will need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`top`, `bottom` must satisfy `bottom >= top + 1`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is now `top`**
