The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial conditions state that `i` is greater than `bottom` before execution, so now `bottom` will be equal to `i`, which means that `bottom` will no longer be less than `i`. Other variables and conditions remain unchanged, as the assignment only affects the `bottom` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged, `bottom` is equal to `i`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` remains less than `top` after execution, and the current value of `i` is greater than the new `bottom` (which is equal to `i`).**
