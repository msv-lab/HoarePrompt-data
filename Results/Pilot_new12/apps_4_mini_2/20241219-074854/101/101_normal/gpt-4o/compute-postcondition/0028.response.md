Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers; `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w'. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, and `j` remains equal to `m`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, while `i` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `m`.***
