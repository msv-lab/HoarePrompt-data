Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', and `top` remains 0. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to the value of `j`, while `bottom`, `left`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is still 'w'.***
