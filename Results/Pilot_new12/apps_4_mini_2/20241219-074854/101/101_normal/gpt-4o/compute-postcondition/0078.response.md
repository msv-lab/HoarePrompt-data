Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `right` is unchanged, `i` is 1, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to `j`; otherwise, the state of all variables remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.***
