Postcondition: ***If `top` is 2 and `j < left`, then `i` is greater than `bottom`, which is 2, `left` is assigned the value of `j`, and the values of `bottom`, `right`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `top` is None or greater than 2, or if `j` is not less than `left`, then all variables (`bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged.***
