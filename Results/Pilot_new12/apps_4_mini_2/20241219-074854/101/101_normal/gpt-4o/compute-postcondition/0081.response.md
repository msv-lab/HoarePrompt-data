Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a list of strings containing at least one 'w', `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is equal to `right` and both are equal to `j` if `top` is None. If `top` is not None, `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than its previous value; if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to `j`; if not, the value of `left` remains unchanged, with `i` remaining 1 and `j` remaining 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1.***
