The loop iterates over the range defined by `left` and `right`, applying specific conditions to update elements in the `result` array based on the values of `i` and `j`. Given the constraints outlined in the initial state, the following output state can be determined:

Output State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2. All positions `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` are updated to '+' if they were initially '.', confirming the frame's corners in the `result` array.**
