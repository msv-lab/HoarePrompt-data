According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `left` and `right`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from `left` and going up to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `right + 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be equal to `left`, and `right` must be greater than or equal to `left`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` would need to be reset to `left`, and the condition for `left` and `right` should still hold true. 

State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` satisfy `bottom >= top + 1` and `left <= right`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `left`**
