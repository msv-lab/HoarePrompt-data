The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. Since `j` is not less than `left` (which is also 0), `left` remains unchanged at 0. Also, `top` remains unchanged, and `bottom` is 2. The variable `i` is 2, which is not greater than `bottom`, and `n` remains greater than 2. The value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `m` remains greater than or equal to 1. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1.**
