Output State: **`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum indices of 'w' characters found in row `i` of `screen` within the range of `m`. If no 'w' is found in row `i`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, while `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `m-1`.**
