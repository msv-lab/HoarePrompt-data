The function processes a grid of dimensions n by m, consisting of characters representing pixels (either black represented by '.' or white represented by 'w'). It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels, calculates the minimum and maximum bounds (minimum and maximum x and y coordinates) for these white pixels, and determines a 'frame size' based on these bounds. If the frame size exceeds either dimension of the grid, it prints -1. If the frame size is within bounds, the function updates the grid by marking the edges (first and last rows/columns defined by the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates) with '+' where the conditions for black pixels are met, while retaining existing white pixels. Finally, it prints the modified grid. The function does not return a value, and it assumes that the input grid contains at least one white pixel. Notably, there is a missing check for the scenario when there are no white pixels, which could affect the logic for calculating bounds and printing results; in such a case, the program would not handle the situation appropriately since it relies on the presence of 'w' pixels for proper functionality.
