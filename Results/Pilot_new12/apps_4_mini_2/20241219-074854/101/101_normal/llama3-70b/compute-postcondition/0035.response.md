According to the provided code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` must be at least 2, indicating that there are at least two iterations possible for `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, meaning `j` would become 2. The value of `m` must remain at least 2 for the condition to continue to hold. 

State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 2**
