According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. The loop iterates from `0` to `m-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, and `m` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute again. To execute the loop one more time, `j` would increase by `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `1`, and `m` must be at least `2`.

State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 1**
