Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 1. If the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` holds true and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[0][1]` is updated to '+'. If the condition does not hold or `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', then `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` retain their values, and `pixels[0][1]` remains '.'***
