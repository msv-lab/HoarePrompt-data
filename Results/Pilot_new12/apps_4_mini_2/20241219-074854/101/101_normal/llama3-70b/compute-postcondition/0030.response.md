The operation `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element at the position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array. 

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, it specifically updates the element at the first row (0 index) and second column (1 index) of the `pixels` matrix or array. The prior values of `n`, `m`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state after executing the code retains all previous state information but updates only where it has changed. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `pixels[0][1]` is '+'**
