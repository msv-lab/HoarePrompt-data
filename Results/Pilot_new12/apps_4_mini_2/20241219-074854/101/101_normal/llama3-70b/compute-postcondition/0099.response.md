The function `func` does not have any parameters explicitly passed to it, as observed from the function definition. Instead, it internally processes input consisting of integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of exactly `m` characters representing pixels. The characters can either be '.' for black pixels or 'w' for white pixels, with the guarantee that at least one character will be 'w'. 

Since the output details were not specified, we can only formulate the functionality based on the provided input constraints:

Functionality: **The function processes an input grid of dimensions n by m, consisting of characters representing pixels, where at least one pixel is white. The specific return value is not described.**
