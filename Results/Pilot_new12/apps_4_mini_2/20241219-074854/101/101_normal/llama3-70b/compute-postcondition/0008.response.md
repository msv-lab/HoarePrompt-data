The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` based on the current values of `x` and `y`. The new values of `min_x` and `min_y` will reflect the minimum of their previous values and the current `x` and `y` values respectively. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 coordinates, `x` is the second element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, `y` is the third element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` is max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is max(previous max_y, y)**
