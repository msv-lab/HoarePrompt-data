The code assigns the value `'+'` to the `pixels` array at the position indexed by `i` and `j`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the code modifies the content of `pixels` at `pixels[1][2]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and only the specific entry in the `pixels` array is updated.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[1][2]` is '+'**.
