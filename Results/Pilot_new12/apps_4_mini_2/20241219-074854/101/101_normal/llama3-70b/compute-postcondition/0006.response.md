The variables `max_x` and `max_y` are updated based on the maximum of the current values compared to the coordinates `x` and `y`, which are the first two elements of `white_pixels`. The previously defined bounds for `max_x` and `max_y` can still be considered.

Given the previous conditions for `x`, `y`, `min_x`, and `min_y`, `max_x` will be assigned the greater value between its current value and `x`, while `max_y` will take the greater value between its current value and `y`. 

Assuming `max_x` and `max_y` had valid initial values prior to running this code, the output state captures the updated values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the first element of `white_pixels`, `y` is the second element of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(min_x, x), `min_y` is min(min_y, y), `max_x` is max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is max(previous max_y, y)**.
