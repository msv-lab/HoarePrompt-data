The `print` function outputs the result of `''.join(row)`, which implies that the content of `row` is expected to be joined into a string and printed. However, the variable `row` has not been defined within the initial state, nor is there any information about its value in the initial state.

Given that `pixels` must contain at least 1 row, it suggests that `row` could be derived from `pixels`. If `pixels` contains at least 1 row, the first valid `row` could be `pixels[0]` or any valid row from `pixels`. However, without specific context of `row`, we cannot determine the exact output.

Thus, the output state remains focused on the fact that `row` is derived from a non-empty `pixels` structure and the print operation occurs but without concrete values of `row`.

Output State: **`pixels` must contain at least 1 row, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds; printed output from joining the content of `row` which is derived from `pixels`**.
