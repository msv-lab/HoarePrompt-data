The statement `min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)` updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y`. Specifically, `min_x` is assigned the smaller value between its current value and `x`, and `min_y` is assigned the smaller value between its current value and `y`. Given that `x` and `y` are defined as elements of `white_pixels`, their values also depend on the specific coordinates present in the list. 

Other variables such as `n`, `m`, and `pixels` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `min_x` and `min_y`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the first element of `white_pixels`, `y` is the second element of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(min_x, x), `min_y` is min(min_y, y)**.
