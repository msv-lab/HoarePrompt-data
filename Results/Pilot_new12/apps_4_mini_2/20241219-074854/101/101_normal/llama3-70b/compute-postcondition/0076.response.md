Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'. If `pixels[i][j]` is '.' and `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `j` is equal to `max_y`, then `pixels[i][j]` is changed to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', no change will occur and we continue to the next iteration; if it's not 'w', `pixels[i][j]` is changed to '.', and it holds that `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, and `j` is not equal to `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not '.'***
