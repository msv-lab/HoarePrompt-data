Output State: **`pixels` is updated such that the first and last rows (indexed by `min_x` and `max_x`) and the first and last columns (indexed by `min_y` and `max_y`) contain '+' where conditions were satisfied; `pixels` remains unchanged where it contained 'w' and is set to '.' elsewhere, except for pixels that were blacked out due to conditions; `n` is the original number of rows, `m` is the original number of columns, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds as specified. If `white_pixels` is empty, then `frame_size` remains not computable.**
