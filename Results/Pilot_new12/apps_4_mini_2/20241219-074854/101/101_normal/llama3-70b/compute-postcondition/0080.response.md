The assignment `pixels[i][j] = '.'` updates the value at the specific position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` list. The index `i` is 2 and the index `j` is 3, so the operation modifies the element at `pixels[2][3]`. 

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment. The initial state of `pixels` indicates that the elements in the row `pixels[2]` can either be '+' or unchanged characters ('.' or 'w') prior to this assignment. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that the variable `pixels` has been altered at the given indices.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 4, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w', `j` is 3, and `pixels[2][3]` is now '.'**
