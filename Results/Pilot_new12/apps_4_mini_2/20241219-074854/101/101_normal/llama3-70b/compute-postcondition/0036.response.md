The assignment `pixels[i][j] = '+'` accesses a specific index in a 2D list `pixels`, where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. The operation sets the value at that position to `'+'`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation, while `i` is also unchanged; it simply reflects the current row being accessed.

Thus, the Output State is: 
`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 2; `pixels[0][2]` is now '+'.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 2; `pixels[0][2]` is now '+'**.
