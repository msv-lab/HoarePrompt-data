According to the code, the loop iterates over `white_pixels`, which is a collection of coordinates. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more coordinates in `white_pixels` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` must have had at least one coordinate, and `x` is the first element of the first coordinate, while `y` is the second element of that coordinate. Since the loop processes one coordinate at a time, after the last iteration, we need to consider the next coordinate in `white_pixels` for the loop to execute one more time.

If `x` and `y` represent the first coordinate of `white_pixels`, after this iteration, the next set of coordinates will be processed. This will update `x` and `y` to the next elements in the `white_pixels` list.

To determine the adjusted states: 
- `white_pixels` must have more than the number of coordinates already processed.
- After executing the loop for the last coordinate, `x` and `y` need to reflect the next elements in `white_pixels`.

Assuming that one coordinate was processed, we can state that for the next iteration (if we have more coordinates), `white_pixels` must have at least one more coordinate, and `x` and `y` will hold the values of that coordinate. 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 coordinates, `x` is the second element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, `y` is the third element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(min_x, x), `min_y` is min(min_y, y), `max_x` is max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is max(previous max_y, y)`**
