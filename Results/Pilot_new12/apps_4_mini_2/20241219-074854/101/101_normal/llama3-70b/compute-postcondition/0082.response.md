Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 4, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'. If either `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y`, or `max_y` and `pixels[2][3]` is '.', then `pixels[2][3]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][3]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop; if `pixels[2][3]` is neither 'w' nor '.', it is set to '.'***
