To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to assess how the `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` values will change based on the complete processing of the `white_pixels` list.

Since the loop iterates over each coordinate `(x, y)` in the `white_pixels` list, the following deductions can be made:

- If `white_pixels` is empty (which must be considered for completeness), the current state of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
- If `white_pixels` contains coordinates, after executing the loop for all the elements of `white_pixels`, the values of `min_x` and `min_y` will represent the minimum x and y coordinates among the white pixel coordinates, while `max_x` and `max_y` will represent the maximum x and y coordinates among these pixel coordinates. 

Now considering that the range of potential input for `n` and `m` is 1 to 2000, we can say:

- If `white_pixels` has at least one coordinate, then `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will reflect the minimum and maximum coordinates within those provided in `white_pixels`.
- If `white_pixels` has no coordinates, `min_x` remains `float('inf')`, `min_y` remains `float('inf')`, `max_x` remains `float('-inf')`, and `max_y` remains `float('-inf')`.

Therefore the final state after all iterations of the loop would be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels; if `white_pixels` is not empty, `min_x` is the minimum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y coordinate in `white_pixels`; if `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf').**
