The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element `pixels[i][j]`. The variables `i` and `j` have specific values of 1, so the specific element being updated is `pixels[1][1]`. Since `pixels[1][1]` was already stated to be `'.'`, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[1][1]` remains '.'**
