The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, in this context, there is no information about the loop structure or which loop (if any) the `continue` statement is affecting. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, and `j`) remain unchanged after executing this statement.

Given this information, the output state retains all the initial conditions without change.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 2; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
