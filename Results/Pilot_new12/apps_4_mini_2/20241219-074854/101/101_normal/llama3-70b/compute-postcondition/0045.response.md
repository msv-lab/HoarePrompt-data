Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is now 0, the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+` where conditions were satisfied and remained unchanged for pixels initially `w` or `.`. The value of `i` is either equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or the value of `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and the value of `pixels[i][j]` is now `+`.**
