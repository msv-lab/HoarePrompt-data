According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `pixels` list. If the list has at least 3 rows, the loop will execute one more time for the third row. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` must contain at least 2 rows, and therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `pixels` must contain at least 3 rows. Since the loop iterates over the rows, the next row to process would be the third row.

State: **`pixels` must contain at least 3 rows; `n` must be greater than 0; `white_pixels` is not empty implies that `frame_size` is within bounds; printed output is the joined string of the elements from the third row of `pixels`.**
