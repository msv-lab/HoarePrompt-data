You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000), followed by n lines each containing exactly m characters where each character is either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one character is 'w'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels; if `white_pixels` is not empty, `min_x` is the minimum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y coordinate in `white_pixels`; if `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf').
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is updated such that the first and last rows (indexed by `min_x` and `max_x`) and the first and last columns (indexed by `min_y` and `max_y`) contain '+' where conditions were satisfied; `pixels` remains unchanged where it contained 'w' and is set to '.' elsewhere, except for pixels that were blacked out due to conditions; `n` is the original number of rows, `m` is the original number of columns, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds as specified. If `white_pixels` is empty, then `frame_size` remains not computable.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is a 2D array where each row has been printed; `n` is the original number of rows in `pixels`; `m` is the original number of columns in `pixels`; if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds; if `pixels` is empty, `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels. If `frame_size` is computed as max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1 and is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the program will proceed accordingly. If `frame_size` is within bounds or if `pixels` is a 2D array that has been printed, the original dimensions of `n` and `m` remain unchanged; if `pixels` is empty, then `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes an input grid of dimensions n by m, consisting of characters representing pixels, where at least one pixel is white. The specific return value is not described.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
