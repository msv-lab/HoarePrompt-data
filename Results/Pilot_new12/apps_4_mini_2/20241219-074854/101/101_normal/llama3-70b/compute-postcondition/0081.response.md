Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 4, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Otherwise, `pixels[2][3]` is now '.'***
