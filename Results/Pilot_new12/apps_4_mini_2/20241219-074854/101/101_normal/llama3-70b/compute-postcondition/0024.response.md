The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop, meaning that the code following the `continue` statement within that loop will not be executed for the current iteration. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The programme will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, either `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.'; the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'**.
