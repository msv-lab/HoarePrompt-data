The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since no variables are being changed directly by this line of code, the only effect is that the loop continues, while the initial values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
