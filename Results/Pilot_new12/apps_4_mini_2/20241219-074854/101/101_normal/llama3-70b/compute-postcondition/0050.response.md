The code assigns the value `'.'` to `pixels[i][j]`. Given the initial state, we know that `pixels[i][j]` was originally `'.'`, but after the execution of the line, it remains `'.'`. Other variables do not change in value or condition.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is now 0, the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+`, it is not the case that (i is equal to min_x or max_x, or j is equal to min_y or max_y), and `pixels[i][j]` is `.` (remains unchanged).**
