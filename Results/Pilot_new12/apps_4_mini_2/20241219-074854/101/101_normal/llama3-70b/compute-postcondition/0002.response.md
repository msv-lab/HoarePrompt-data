The code creates a list called `white_pixels` that contains tuples of coordinates `(i, j)` for each pixel in the `pixels` list where the value is equal to `'w'`. The sizes of `n` and `m` dictate the dimensions of the `pixels` list, which can contain values at these coordinates.

- The variable `white_pixels` will be assigned a list of tuples based on the condition specified.
- `white_pixels` will contain tuples for every `(i, j)` pair where `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, but no prior values of `white_pixels` exist before this operation.

Thus, the output state captures the updated variable and clarifies its details.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000); `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000); `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing input values; `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates `(i, j)` where `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`.**
