According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `pixels` structure. The loop is set to iterate over each `row` in `pixels`, so `pixels` must be a non-empty collection (list, array, etc.) for the loop to execute. 

The original state mentions that `n` is the number of rows, which implies that `pixels` should contain at least `n` rows. If `white_pixels` is not empty, it means that there are some rows in `pixels` that still contain valid data, and it's also stated that `frame_size` is within bounds; hence, the loop can execute. 

However, if `white_pixels` is empty, we have the statement that `frame_size` remains not computable, which indicates that the loop may not have valid data to operate on. Thus, the conditions regarding `white_pixels` impact the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `pixels` must contain at least one row, `n` must be greater than 0 (as it must correspond to the number of rows), and it is assumed the loop will iterate through each row. 

State: **`pixels` must contain at least 1 row, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds**.
