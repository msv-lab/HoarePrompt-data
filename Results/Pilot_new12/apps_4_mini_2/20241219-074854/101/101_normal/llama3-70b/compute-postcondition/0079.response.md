The `continue` statement will skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. However, without additional context, we cannot determine which variables if any, would be affected by this statement. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `pixels`, which consists of specific elements, will not be modified since no operations are applied to it in this code snippet. Therefore, we only note the continuation of the loop without altering any variables.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 4, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w', `j` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
