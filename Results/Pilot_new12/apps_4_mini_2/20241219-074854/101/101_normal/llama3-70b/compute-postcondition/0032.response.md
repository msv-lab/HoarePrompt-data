The given code snippet assigns the value `'.'` to the element in `pixels` at the position indexed by `i` and `j`. The state of the variable `pixels` is affected due to this assignment. 

Before executing the code:
- `n` must be at least 1 (it's a constraint but doesn't directly affect `pixels`).
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be at least 2 (also a constraint, not directly relevant to this line of code).
- `j` is 1.

Since `i` has the value 0 and `j` has the value 1, after executing `pixels[i][j] = '.'`:
- The element `pixels[0][1]` is now set to `'.'`.

The conditions on `n` and `m` remain valid as they are constraints that do not change during the assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `pixels[0][1]` is '.'**
