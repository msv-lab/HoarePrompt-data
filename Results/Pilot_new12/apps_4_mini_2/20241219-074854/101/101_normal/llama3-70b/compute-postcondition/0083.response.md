According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the index `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and it is stated that `m` must be at least 4. Since the loop variable `j` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 after each iteration, if the value of `j` was at its maximum during the last iteration (which is 3), for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 4, and to do that `m` must be at least 5.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 5, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'.**
