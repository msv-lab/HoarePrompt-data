The code `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no specific variables are modified or assigned new values by this statement, the previous state values remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and the array `pixels` still hold their prior values, as this command does not alter them.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the array `pixels[1][1]` is '.'**
