The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly. It simply instructs the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. All the variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 5, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'; continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
