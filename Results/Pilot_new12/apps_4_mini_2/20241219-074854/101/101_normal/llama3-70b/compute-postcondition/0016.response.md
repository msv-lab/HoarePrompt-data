The code snippet provided only contains a print statement that outputs `-1`. There are no variable assignments or changes to the state as a result of this code. Therefore, all previously defined variables retain their values, along with the condition that `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels, `frame_size` is computed as max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1, and the current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
