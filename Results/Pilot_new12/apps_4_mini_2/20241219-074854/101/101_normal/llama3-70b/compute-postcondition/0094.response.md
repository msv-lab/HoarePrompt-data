The code executes a print statement that outputs the result of joining the content of `row`, which is derived from the second row of `pixels`. The initial state ensures that `pixels` has at least 2 rows. Therefore, `row` refers to `pixels[1]`. The other variables are not modified. The output will be the joined string of the elements in the second row.

Output State: **`pixels` must contain at least 2 rows; `n` must be greater than 0; `white_pixels` is not empty implies that `frame_size` is within bounds; printed output is the joined string of the elements from the second row of `pixels`.**
