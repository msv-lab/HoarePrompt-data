The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Given that `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, and `j` is 1, all conditions and values remain the same after the `continue` statement is executed.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
