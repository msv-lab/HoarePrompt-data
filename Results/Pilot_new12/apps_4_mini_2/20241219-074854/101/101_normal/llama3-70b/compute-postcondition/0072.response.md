The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. It only affects the control flow of the loop.

In this case, we are in a loop where certain conditions regarding the variables are checked, and due to the `continue` statement, the remaining code for the current iteration will not execute, but the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `pixels`, and any other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w', `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `j` is not equal to `max_y`, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w', `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `j` is not equal to `max_y`, the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
