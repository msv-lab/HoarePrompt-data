The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by unpacking the result of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` is expected to return a string representation of two integers separated by a space. The initial state indicates that both `n` and `m` must be integers in the range from 1 to 2000, and the subsequent lines contain exactly `m` characters which are either '.' or 'w'.

The impact of the code:
- The values of `n` and `m` are changed based on the integer inputs provided. 
- No other variables are affected in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000)**.
