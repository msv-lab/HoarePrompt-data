The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement; instead, execution will return to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of the variables, along with the fact that we will skip the current loop iteration but remain inside the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is now 0, the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+`, it is not the case that (i is equal to min_x or max_x, or j is equal to min_y or max_y), `pixels[i][j]` is `w`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
