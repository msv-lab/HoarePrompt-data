According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. For the loop to run at least once, `white_pixels` must contain at least one coordinate where `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that the `white_pixels` list is not empty. Additionally, once the loop starts, `x` and `y` will take the value of the first coordinate in `white_pixels`. 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the first element of `white_pixels`, `y` is the second element of `white_pixels`**.
