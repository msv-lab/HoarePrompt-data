According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Furthermore, to allow the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
