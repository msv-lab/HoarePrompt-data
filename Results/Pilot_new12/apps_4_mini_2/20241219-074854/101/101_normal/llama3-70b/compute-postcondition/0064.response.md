Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[1][2]` is '+', some action related to this condition occurs. If not, and `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then it remains unchanged, indicating that the specific condition for 'w' is not met.***
