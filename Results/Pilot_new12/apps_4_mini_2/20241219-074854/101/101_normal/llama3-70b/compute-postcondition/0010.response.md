According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 3 coordinates, the loop will execute again for the third coordinate. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 coordinates, and the current coordinate being processed is the second coordinate, where `x` is the second element and `y` is the third element of that coordinate.

For the loop to execute one more time, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 coordinates, and since `x` is the second element of the second coordinate, for the next iteration, it will process the third coordinate, thus `x` will be the second element of that third coordinate and `y` will be the third element of that third coordinate.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 coordinates, `x` is the second element of the third coordinate of `white_pixels`, `y` is the third element of the third coordinate of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` is max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is max(previous max_y, y)`**
