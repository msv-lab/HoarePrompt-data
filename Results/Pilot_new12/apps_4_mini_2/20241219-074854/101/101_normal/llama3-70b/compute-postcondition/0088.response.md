Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 5. If (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and `pixels[2][j]` is '.', then `pixels[2][j]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` remain either '+' or unchanged as '.' or 'w', and if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop while `pixels[2][j]` is '.' for some `j` in the range [0, m-1].***
