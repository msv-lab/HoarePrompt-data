Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels. If `frame_size` is computed as max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1 and is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the program will proceed accordingly. If `frame_size` is within bounds or if `pixels` is a 2D array that has been printed, the original dimensions of `n` and `m` remain unchanged; if `pixels` is empty, then `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.***
