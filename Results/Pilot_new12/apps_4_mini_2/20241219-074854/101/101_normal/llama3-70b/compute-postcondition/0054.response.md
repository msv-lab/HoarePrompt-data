The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated with the value `'+'`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, this means that the element at the position `pixels[1][1]` is changed to `'+'. The state of other variables remains unchanged and the previous conditions regarding their values still hold.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[1][1]` is '+'**.
