According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run another time.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is non-negative, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are updated to either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w' based on the conditions applied during loop execution.**
