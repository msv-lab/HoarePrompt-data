Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is now 0, and the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+`. It is not the case that (i is equal to min_x or max_x, or j is equal to min_y or max_y). If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', we skip the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged and is `.`.***
