The variables `min_x` and `min_y` are updated to be the minimum between their previous values and the coordinates `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are derived from the third coordinate of `white_pixels`. Given that `min_x` was previously defined as `min(previous min_x, x)` and `min_y` as `min(previous min_y, y)`, we can conclude that after executing the code, these variables will reflect the new minimums based on the current coordinates.

If we let `previous min_x`, `previous min_y`, `x`, and `y` represent the respective values before the execution, the updated output states can be specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 coordinates, `x` is the second element of the third coordinate of `white_pixels`, `y` is the third element of the third coordinate of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` remains unchanged, and `max_y` remains unchanged.**
