According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, which allows the loop to execute again. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, at the start of the next iteration `i` will be 1. For `n`, it remains at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is non-negative, `j` is equal to `m`, the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+` where conditions were satisfied and remained unchanged for pixels initially `w` or `.`.**
