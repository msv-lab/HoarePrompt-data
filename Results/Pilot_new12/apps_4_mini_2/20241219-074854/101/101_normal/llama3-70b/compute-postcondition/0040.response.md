Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 2. If the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` is true and `pixels[0][2]` is `'.'`, then `pixels[0][2]` is updated to `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; if it is not `'w'`, then `pixels[0][2]` remains `'.'`.***
