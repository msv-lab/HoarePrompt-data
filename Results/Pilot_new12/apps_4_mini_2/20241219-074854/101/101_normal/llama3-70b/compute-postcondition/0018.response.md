According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times, where `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`. 

The initial states provided include integers `n` and `m`, a list of lists `pixels`, and a list of coordinates `white_pixels`. The key point is that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, since `range(n)` will generate an iterable from 0 to `n-1`. 

Additionally, the values of `white_pixels` and `frame_size` are not relevant to the execution of this specific loop, but they could impact other logic surrounding it.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1 and `i` needs to be initialized to 0 as the loop starts its first iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
