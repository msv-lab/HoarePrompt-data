To determine the output state based on the given initial conditions and code, let's analyze the effects of the code step by step:

- The code calculates `frame_size` based on the values of `max_x`, `min_x`, `max_y`, and `min_y`.
- If `white_pixels` is not empty, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will have specific integer values (the minimum and maximum coordinates of white pixels).
- If `white_pixels` is empty, then `min_x` is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is `float('-inf')`, and `max_y` is `float('-inf')`.

Now, let's examine the two scenarios:

1. **When `white_pixels` is not empty:**
   - In this case, let’s assume the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` have been calculated accordingly.
   - The value of `frame_size` will be calculated as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.
   - Thus, `frame_size` will hold an integer value which represents the larger dimension of the bounding frame containing the white pixels.

2. **When `white_pixels` is empty:**
   - The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will be `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, and `float('-inf')`, respectively.
   - In this case, calculating `frame_size` results in `max(float('-inf') - float('inf'), float('-inf') - float('inf')) + 1`, which mathematically evaluates to `float('-inf')` + 1, retaining the invalid frame size representation. Hence it cannot be calculated into a meaningful frame size.

Thus, we can provide the output states for each case.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels; if `white_pixels` is not empty, `frame_size` is max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1; if `white_pixels` is empty, `frame_size` is not computable with valid values as `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are at extreme values.**
