Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is the original value, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'. All elements of the row `pixels[2]` have been processed according to the conditions laid out in the loop, where '.' is changed to '+' if `i` equals `min_x`, `max_x`, or if `j` equals `min_y`, `max_y`; otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', no change occurs, and if it's neither 'w' nor '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'**.
