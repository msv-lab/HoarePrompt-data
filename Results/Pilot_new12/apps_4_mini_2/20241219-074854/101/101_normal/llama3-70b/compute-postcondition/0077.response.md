According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the variable `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` must be adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `m` must be at least 1, and `j` is currently 2, to execute one more time, `j` must now be 3 (which would require `m` to be at least 4 in total).

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 4, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w', `j` is 3**
