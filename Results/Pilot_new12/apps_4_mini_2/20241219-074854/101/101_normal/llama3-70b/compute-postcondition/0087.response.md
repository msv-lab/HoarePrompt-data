Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 5, and `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w'. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[2][j]` is '.' for some `j` in the range [0, m-1], while `pixels[2][0]` to `pixels[2][m-1]` remain as either '+' or unchanged as '.' or 'w'.***
