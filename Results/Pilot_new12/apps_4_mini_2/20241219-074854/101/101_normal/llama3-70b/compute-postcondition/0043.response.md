To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the for loop and the provided state information.

The provided state indicates:
- `n` is at least 1 (which does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `i` is 1 (which is irrelevant to the loop since `i` is not used).
- `m` is non-negative (important since it defines the range for the loop).
- `j` is equal to `m` (this is crucial because the loop iterates `j` from 0 to `m - 1`).
- The array `pixels` has a specific update condition.

The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0 (since `range(m)` creates an empty iterable if `m` is 0). However, since `j` is currently equal to `m`, it means that the first execution of the loop will not happen as `j` starts at the limit (m), not within the range.

For the loop to execute at least once, `j` needs to be adjusted to start at `0`, which means we have to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can begin with `j` taking the value of `0`. 

Additionally, `m` must be at least 1 to ensure there is an actual range to iterate over.

Thus, the adjustments needed are as follows:
- Set `j` to `0`.
- Ensure that `m` remains as at least 1.

Based on this reasoning, the response should be as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `j` is now 0, the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+` where conditions were satisfied and remained unchanged for pixels initially `w` or `.`**
