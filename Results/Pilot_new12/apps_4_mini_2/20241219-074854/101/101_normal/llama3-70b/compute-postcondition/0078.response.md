The code assigns the value `'+'` to `pixels[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, the specific pixel value that is being changed is `pixels[2][3]`. The other variables and their values remain unaffected by this assignment. The preconditions regarding `n`, `m`, and the contents of `pixels[i]` still hold true after the code is executed.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 4, `pixels[i][0]` to `pixels[i][m-1]` are either '+' or remain unchanged as '.' or 'w', `j` is 3, and `pixels[2][3]` is '+'**
