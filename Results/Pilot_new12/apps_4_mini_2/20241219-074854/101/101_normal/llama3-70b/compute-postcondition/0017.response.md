Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels. If `white_pixels` is not empty, `frame_size` is not greater than max(n, m); if `white_pixels` is empty, `frame_size` is not computable.***
