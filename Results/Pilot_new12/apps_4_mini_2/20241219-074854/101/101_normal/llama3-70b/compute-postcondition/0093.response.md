According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels`. If `pixels` contains at least 2 rows, the loop will execute again for the second row. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` must contain at least 1 row, which was processed in the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `pixels` must contain at least 2 rows. The variable `row` represents the next row in `pixels` to be processed.

State: **`pixels` must contain at least 2 rows, `n` must be greater than 0, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds; printed output from joining the content of `row` which is derived from the second row of `pixels`.**
