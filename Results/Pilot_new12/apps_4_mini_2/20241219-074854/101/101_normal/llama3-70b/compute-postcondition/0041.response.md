Initial State: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0

The loop iterates over `j` for `m` times. After all iterations of the loop have been executed:

- If `m` is greater than 0, then `j` will range from `0` to `m-1`. 
- The value of `pixels[i][j]` will change to `+` if the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` is satisfied and `pixels[i][j]` is `.`. 
- If `pixels[i][j]` is `w`, it remains `w`. For all other values, if the pixel was not changed to `+` and is neither `w`, it remains as is.

If no iterations occur (i.e., if `m` is 0), `j` does not change and stays at its initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` is non-negative; `j` is equal to `m`; the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+` where conditions were satisfied and remained unchanged for pixels initially `w` or `.`.**
