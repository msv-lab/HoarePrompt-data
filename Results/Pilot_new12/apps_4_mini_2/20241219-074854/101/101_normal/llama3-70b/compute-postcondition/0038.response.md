The code snippet assigns the value `'.'` to `pixels[i][j]`. The variable `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so the operation updates the specific element at the 0th row and 2nd column of the `pixels` array with the character `'.'`. The other variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `m` must be at least 2; `j` is 2; pixels[0][2] is '.'**
