Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 3 coordinates, `x` is the second element of the third coordinate of `white_pixels`, `y` is the third element of the third coordinate of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` remains unchanged, `max_y` remains unchanged, `max_x` = max(max_x, x), `max_y` = max(max_y, y)**
