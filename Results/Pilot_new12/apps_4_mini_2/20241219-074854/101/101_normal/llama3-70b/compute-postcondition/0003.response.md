The variables `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are assigned new values based on the float representations of positive and negative infinity. Specifically, `min_x` and `min_y` are set to the smallest possible float value (positive infinity), whereas `max_x` and `max_y` are set to the largest possible float value (negative infinity). The values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, and `white_pixels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000); `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000); `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing input values; `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates `(i, j)` where `pixels[i][j] == 'w'; min_x is float('inf'); min_y is float('inf'); max_x is float('-inf'); max_y is float('-inf')**
