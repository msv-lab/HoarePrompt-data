Given the code and initial state, let's analyze the impact.

1. The initial conditions dictate that `x` is the second element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, and `y` is the third element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`.
2. The variables `max_x` and `max_y` are updated by the expressions provided. Specifically:
   - `max_x` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `x`.
   - `max_y` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `y`.
   
The previous values of `max_x` and `max_y` will determine the new values based on `x` and `y`.

Since the initial state does not provide the specific previous values of `max_x` and `max_y`, but they are adjusted based on the maximum relationship with `x` and `y`, we conclude:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` must have at least 2 coordinates, `x` is the second element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, `y` is the third element of the second coordinate of `white_pixels`, `min_x` is min(previous min_x, x), `min_y` is min(previous min_y, y), `max_x` is max(previous max_x, x), `max_y` is max(previous max_y, y)`**.
