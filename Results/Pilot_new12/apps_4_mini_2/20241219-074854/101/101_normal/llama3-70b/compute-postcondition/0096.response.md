The code `print(''.join(row))` takes the third row of the `pixels` list (which is at index 2 in a zero-indexed list) and joins all its elements into a single string. Since `pixels` must contain at least 3 rows, we can safely access the third row.

The printed output is a string composed of the elements of the third row. However, the specific contents of the third row are not provided in the initial conditions or the code snippet. Thus, we can only describe the output as a string resulting from the join operation on the third row, and we assume that `row` contains the third row of `pixels`.

Output State: **`pixels` must contain at least 3 rows; `n` must be greater than 0; `white_pixels` is not empty implies that `frame_size` is within bounds; the printed output is the joined string of the elements from the third row of `pixels`.**
