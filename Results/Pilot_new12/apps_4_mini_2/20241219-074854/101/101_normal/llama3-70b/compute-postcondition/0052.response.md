Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is now 0, and the array `pixels` has been updated such that `pixels[0][j]` is `+`. If `i` is equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` was originally '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is now set to '+'. Otherwise, if none of these conditions apply, and if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the current iteration is skipped. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', it remains unchanged and is '.'***
