You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and reasoning.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the smallest square frame around the white pixels ('w') on a monitor grid, ensuring:
1. The frame has a width of 1 pixel.
2. The frame stays within the grid boundaries.
3. All white pixels should be on the frame.
4. If no suitable frame exists, the program should output -1.

### Code Analysis
The code attempts to:
1. Read the grid dimensions and pixel information.
2. Store the coordinates of all white pixels.
3. Determine the min and max coordinates of these white pixels to calculate the frame size.
4. Check if the frame size can fit within the grid bounds.
5. Construct the output grid with the proper frame and white pixels.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Single White Pixel:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     1 1
     w
     ```
   - Expected output: The single pixel will remain as 'w', and the frame cannot exist since the frame size would be 1 based on `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is technically valid but does not allow for a frame around a single pixel.

2. **Invalid Frame with Excessive Padding:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     4 5
     .....
     .w...
     .....
     .....
     ```
   - Expected output: It cannot form a frame around existing whites thus should print -1, but might not go through conditions as expected because the calculated `frame_size` is valid.

3. **Multiple Whites in a line but not fitting for a frame:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     w..
     ...
     w..
     ```
   - Expected output: With the `frame_size` calculated as 3, it should ideally check bounds and output a frame that fails to apply since there's no valid frame. Should return -1.

### Conclusion
The constructed frame is based on the boundaries of the white pixels; if they don't form a frame or sit in such a formation that cannot accommodate expected outlines correctly, it should return -1.

In scenarios 1, 2, and 3, it should output -1, but given constructed logic, it may not effectively check bounds for digital screens correctly when creating the frame, potentially leading to incorrect outputs.

### Correctness Statement
Correctness: **False**. 
The program fails to accurately handle edge cases where the frame cannot be constructed, such as when:
- A single white pixel is present.
- White pixels do not form a complete square, thus leading to a situation where a valid frame cannot be formed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000), followed by n lines each containing exactly m characters where each character is either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one character is 'w'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels; if `white_pixels` is not empty, `min_x` is the minimum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y coordinate in `white_pixels`; if `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf').
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is updated such that the first and last rows (indexed by `min_x` and `max_x`) and the first and last columns (indexed by `min_y` and `max_y`) contain '+' where conditions were satisfied; `pixels` remains unchanged where it contained 'w' and is set to '.' elsewhere, except for pixels that were blacked out due to conditions; `n` is the original number of rows, `m` is the original number of columns, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds as specified. If `white_pixels` is empty, then `frame_size` remains not computable.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is a 2D array where each row has been printed; `n` is the original number of rows in `pixels`; `m` is the original number of columns in `pixels`; if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds; if `pixels` is empty, `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels. If `frame_size` is computed as max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1 and is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the program will proceed accordingly. If `frame_size` is within bounds or if `pixels` is a 2D array that has been printed, the original dimensions of `n` and `m` remain unchanged; if `pixels` is empty, then `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.
