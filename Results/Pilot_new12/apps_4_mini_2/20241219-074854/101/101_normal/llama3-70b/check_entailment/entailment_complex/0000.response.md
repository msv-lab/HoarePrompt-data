Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly check whether the calculated frame size is valid with respect to the presence of white pixels (those represented by 'w') within the determined bounding box. 

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Frame Size Calculation**: The program calculates `frame_size` based solely on the `max_x`, `max_y`, `min_x`, and `min_y` values. However, it does not ensure that within these bounds (edges indicated by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`), there are only pixels that are either 'w' or eligible for marking as '+' when the frame is applied. It could happen that there are missing 'w' pixels along one or more edges of the bounding box.

2. **Output Requirements**: According to the problem statement, if there are multiple valid frames, any of them may be printed. However, if any edges of the frame defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` do not completely consist of 'w' pixels or result in an invalid configuration (one lacking continuous edges of 'w'), the program should ideally return `-1` instead. The current logic presents a valid frame without sufficient checks, potentially violating the problem statement's requirement.

3. **Unbounded Frame Check**: The condition `if (frame_size > max(n, m)):` checks if the frame size exceeds the monitor's resolution but does not cover cases where the white pixels might not form a valid frame, giving an incorrect printout instead of returning `-1`.

In conclusion, the program lacks checks to ensure the frame can be satisfactorily formed with 'w' pixels located at the corners (or edges) of the bounding box defined by the white pixels. Thus, it does not fully comply with the detailed requirements put forth in the problem description under all circumstances.
