You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and check for any edge cases or scenarios that it may not handle correctly.

1. **Logic to Identify White Pixels**: 
   - The program identifies the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') in the input. This is correct and necessary to determine the minimum bounding frame.

2. **Calculating Frame Dimensions**:
   - It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which will define the corners of the frame. The frame size is calculated as the maximum distance between these extreme coordinates plus one, which appropriately represents the necessary dimensions to encapsulate all white pixels.

3. **Frame Size Check**:
   - The code checks whether the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the display (`max(n, m)`). However, this check is incorrect. If the frame size could not fit within the bounds, it should also ensure it's not just based on `max`, but must encapsulate white pixels correctly. 

4. **Frame Construction**:
   - The program then attempts to fill in the '+' characters to create the frame around detected white pixels. The logic for determining frame placement seems partially correct, but it may not handle the case where the required frame goes beyond the bounds of the array (especially in cases where the minimum white pixel is at (0,0) and the maximum at (n-1,m-1), thus making it potentially out of bounds).

5. **No Frame Scenario**:
   - If no frame can be formed, the program does not return `-1` immediately after checking limits; it attempts to place frame characters on pixels even when they would not form a valid frame.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:

```
2 6
w..w..
...w..
```

Expected Output: `-1` (since the white pixels are isolated and do not form a valid frame).

Actual Program Output: 

```
w..w..
+.+...
```

The program processes the frame incorrectly by attempting to place the '+' characters, thus failing to check for valid frame formation properly and not returning `-1` as required.

### Conclusion

Since the program fails to handle edge cases correctly and does not always verify if a proper frame can be built under the constraints given in the problem statement, we reach the following result:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a grid of dimensions n by m, consisting of characters representing pixels (either black represented by '.' or white represented by 'w'). It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels, calculates the minimum and maximum bounds (minimum and maximum x and y coordinates) for these white pixels, and determines a 'frame size' based on these bounds. If the frame size exceeds either dimension of the grid, it prints -1. If the frame size is within bounds, the function updates the grid by marking the edges (first and last rows/columns defined by the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates) with '+' where the conditions for black pixels are met, while retaining existing white pixels. Finally, it prints the modified grid. The function does not return a value, and it assumes that the input grid contains at least one white pixel. Notably, there is a missing check for the scenario when there are no white pixels, which could affect the logic for calculating bounds and printing results; in such a case, the program would not handle the situation appropriately since it relies on the presence of 'w' pixels for proper functionality.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
