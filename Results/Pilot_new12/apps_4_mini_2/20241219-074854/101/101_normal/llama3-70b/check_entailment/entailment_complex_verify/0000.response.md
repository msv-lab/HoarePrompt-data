Final: **False** 

The original assessment identifies several edge cases where the program may fail to produce the correct output. Specifically, it does not properly handle scenarios where:
1. The white pixels do not form a complete square frame (e.g., when they are arranged in a line) leading to a frame that cannot be correctly displayed.
2. Only a single white pixel exists, which does not allow for the construction of a frame.
3. The logic around the calculated frame size and its ability to fit within the bounds of the monitor is incorrectly handled, potentially leading to incorrect decisions about whether to print -1.

The annotated version confirms these issues by illustrating that certain conditions are not being adequately checked, particularly concerning the arrangement of the white pixels and the resulting frame size. Hence, the original assessment rightly concludes that the program is not correct due to failure to account for these critical boundary conditions.
