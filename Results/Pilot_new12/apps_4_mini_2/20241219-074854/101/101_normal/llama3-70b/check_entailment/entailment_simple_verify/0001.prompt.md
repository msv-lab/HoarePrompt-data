You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and check for any edge cases or scenarios that it may not handle correctly.

1. **Logic to Identify White Pixels**: 
   - The program identifies the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') in the input. This is correct and necessary to determine the minimum bounding frame.

2. **Calculating Frame Dimensions**:
   - It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which will define the corners of the frame. The frame size is calculated as the maximum distance between these extreme coordinates plus one, which appropriately represents the necessary dimensions to encapsulate all white pixels.

3. **Frame Size Check**:
   - The code checks whether the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the display (`max(n, m)`). However, this check is incorrect. If the frame size could not fit within the bounds, it should also ensure it's not just based on `max`, but must encapsulate white pixels correctly. 

4. **Frame Construction**:
   - The program then attempts to fill in the '+' characters to create the frame around detected white pixels. The logic for determining frame placement seems partially correct, but it may not handle the case where the required frame goes beyond the bounds of the array (especially in cases where the minimum white pixel is at (0,0) and the maximum at (n-1,m-1), thus making it potentially out of bounds).

5. **No Frame Scenario**:
   - If no frame can be formed, the program does not return `-1` immediately after checking limits; it attempts to place frame characters on pixels even when they would not form a valid frame.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:

```
2 6
w..w..
...w..
```

Expected Output: `-1` (since the white pixels are isolated and do not form a valid frame).

Actual Program Output: 

```
w..w..
+.+...
```

The program processes the frame incorrectly by attempting to place the '+' characters, thus failing to check for valid frame formation properly and not returning `-1` as required.

### Conclusion

Since the program fails to handle edge cases correctly and does not always verify if a proper frame can be built under the constraints given in the problem statement, we reach the following result:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000), followed by n lines each containing exactly m characters where each character is either '.' (representing a black pixel) or 'w' (representing a white pixel). It is guaranteed that at least one character is 'w'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels; if `white_pixels` is not empty, `min_x` is the minimum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x coordinate in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y coordinate in `white_pixels`; if `white_pixels` is empty, `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf').
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is updated such that the first and last rows (indexed by `min_x` and `max_x`) and the first and last columns (indexed by `min_y` and `max_y`) contain '+' where conditions were satisfied; `pixels` remains unchanged where it contained 'w' and is set to '.' elsewhere, except for pixels that were blacked out due to conditions; `n` is the original number of rows, `m` is the original number of columns, and if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds as specified. If `white_pixels` is empty, then `frame_size` remains not computable.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `pixels` is a 2D array where each row has been printed; `n` is the original number of rows in `pixels`; `m` is the original number of columns in `pixels`; if `white_pixels` is not empty, then `frame_size` is within bounds; if `pixels` is empty, `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a list of `n` lists containing input values, and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates representing white pixels. If `frame_size` is computed as max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1 and is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the program will proceed accordingly. If `frame_size` is within bounds or if `pixels` is a 2D array that has been printed, the original dimensions of `n` and `m` remain unchanged; if `pixels` is empty, then `n` must be 0 and no output will be printed.
