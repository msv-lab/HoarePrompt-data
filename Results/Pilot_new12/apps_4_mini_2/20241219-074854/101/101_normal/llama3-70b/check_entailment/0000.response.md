To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and reasoning.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the smallest square frame around the white pixels ('w') on a monitor grid, ensuring:
1. The frame has a width of 1 pixel.
2. The frame stays within the grid boundaries.
3. All white pixels should be on the frame.
4. If no suitable frame exists, the program should output -1.

### Code Analysis
The code attempts to:
1. Read the grid dimensions and pixel information.
2. Store the coordinates of all white pixels.
3. Determine the min and max coordinates of these white pixels to calculate the frame size.
4. Check if the frame size can fit within the grid bounds.
5. Construct the output grid with the proper frame and white pixels.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Single White Pixel:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     1 1
     w
     ```
   - Expected output: The single pixel will remain as 'w', and the frame cannot exist since the frame size would be 1 based on `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is technically valid but does not allow for a frame around a single pixel.

2. **Invalid Frame with Excessive Padding:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     4 5
     .....
     .w...
     .....
     .....
     ```
   - Expected output: It cannot form a frame around existing whites thus should print -1, but might not go through conditions as expected because the calculated `frame_size` is valid.

3. **Multiple Whites in a line but not fitting for a frame:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     w..
     ...
     w..
     ```
   - Expected output: With the `frame_size` calculated as 3, it should ideally check bounds and output a frame that fails to apply since there's no valid frame. Should return -1.

### Conclusion
The constructed frame is based on the boundaries of the white pixels; if they don't form a frame or sit in such a formation that cannot accommodate expected outlines correctly, it should return -1.

In scenarios 1, 2, and 3, it should output -1, but given constructed logic, it may not effectively check bounds for digital screens correctly when creating the frame, potentially leading to incorrect outputs.

### Correctness Statement
Correctness: **False**. 
The program fails to accurately handle edge cases where the frame cannot be constructed, such as when:
- A single white pixel is present.
- White pixels do not form a complete square, thus leading to a situation where a valid frame cannot be formed.
