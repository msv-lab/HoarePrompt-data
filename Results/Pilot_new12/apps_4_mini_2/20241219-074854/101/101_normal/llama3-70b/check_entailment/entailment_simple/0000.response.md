To determine whether the provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the functionality of the program step-by-step against the requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program first captures the dimensions of the monitor, `n` and `m`, and then collects the pixel states into a 2D list named `pixels`. According to the problem, this is correct.

2. **Finding the Extents of White Pixels**: 
   - The program constructs a list of coordinates for all white pixels (`'w'`) on the screen. It calculates the minimum and maximum extents of these white pixels in both dimensions. This is crucial because it helps define where the square frame should appear.

3. **Calculating Frame Size**: 
   - The frame size is calculated based on the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels. The program checks if this frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor. If the frame size is too large, it correctly prints `-1`, indicating that a valid frame cannot be constructed.

4. **Drawing the Frame**: 
   - The program iterates through all pixels to draw the frame. It places the `'+'` character where needed based on the frame boundaries and preserves the original `'w'` characters, setting all other pixels back to `'.'`. The output is structured correctly as specified.

5. **Output the Result**: 
   - Finally, the program prints the modified pixel grid or `-1` if a valid frame cannot be drawn.

### Considerations for Correctness:
- **Correct Frame Identification**: The program ensures that all white pixels are on the frame perimeter and no extra pixels exist in the frame area outside of white pixels.
- **Minimum Size Frame**: It seeks the smallest possible square frame that contains all white pixels, adheres to the frame constraints (one-pixel wide, fitting entirely on the screen), and does not alter existing white pixels.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
The program accounts for several edge cases:
- If there are white pixels but they are isolated, the program correctly identifies that it can only return the unmodified screen or draw the frame.
- Avoids drawing frames when impossible by checking against monitor dimensions.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program handles all stipulated requirements in the problem description and appropriately manages potential edge cases, we can assess that the program is functioning correctly.

Correctness: **True**
