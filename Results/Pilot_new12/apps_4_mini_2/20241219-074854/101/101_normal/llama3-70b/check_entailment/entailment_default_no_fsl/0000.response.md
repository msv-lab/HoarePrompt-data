Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if the pixels have a configuration with white pixels such that they are not able to form a valid square boundary, the program would incorrectly attempt to define a frame based on the maximum and minimum bounds derived from the white pixels. 

An example where the program fails is:

Input:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```

In this case, the existing white pixels are at positions (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 5), and (1, 2). Based on the code, it will wrongly calculate a frame size and attempt to place '+' characters in positions that do not form a valid 1-pixel wide frame around the white pixels. The expected output is -1 since it is impossible to create a valid frame that meets the requirements. However, the program no longer properly checks for such invalid configurations where white pixels do not form a contiguous area suitable for framing.

Thus, the output will not match the expected behavior described in the problem statement, which indicates that the program is incorrect.
