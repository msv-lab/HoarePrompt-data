To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and check for any edge cases or scenarios that it may not handle correctly.

1. **Logic to Identify White Pixels**: 
   - The program identifies the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') in the input. This is correct and necessary to determine the minimum bounding frame.

2. **Calculating Frame Dimensions**:
   - It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which will define the corners of the frame. The frame size is calculated as the maximum distance between these extreme coordinates plus one, which appropriately represents the necessary dimensions to encapsulate all white pixels.

3. **Frame Size Check**:
   - The code checks whether the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the display (`max(n, m)`). However, this check is incorrect. If the frame size could not fit within the bounds, it should also ensure it's not just based on `max`, but must encapsulate white pixels correctly. 

4. **Frame Construction**:
   - The program then attempts to fill in the '+' characters to create the frame around detected white pixels. The logic for determining frame placement seems partially correct, but it may not handle the case where the required frame goes beyond the bounds of the array (especially in cases where the minimum white pixel is at (0,0) and the maximum at (n-1,m-1), thus making it potentially out of bounds).

5. **No Frame Scenario**:
   - If no frame can be formed, the program does not return `-1` immediately after checking limits; it attempts to place frame characters on pixels even when they would not form a valid frame.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:

```
2 6
w..w..
...w..
```

Expected Output: `-1` (since the white pixels are isolated and do not form a valid frame).

Actual Program Output: 

```
w..w..
+.+...
```

The program processes the frame incorrectly by attempting to place the '+' characters, thus failing to check for valid frame formation properly and not returning `-1` as required.

### Conclusion

Since the program fails to handle edge cases correctly and does not always verify if a proper frame can be built under the constraints given in the problem statement, we reach the following result:

Correctness: **False**
