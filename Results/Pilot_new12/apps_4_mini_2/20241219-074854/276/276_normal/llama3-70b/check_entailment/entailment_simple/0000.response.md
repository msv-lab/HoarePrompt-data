Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Functionality**:
   - The program reads two binary strings (representing numbers in the "golden system") from input.
   - It converts each binary string to its decimal equivalent using the base \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).
   - The conversion is done in the `func_1` function, where it calculates the decimal value using the correct formula, \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \), by iterating over the string in reverse.
   - Finally, it compares the two decimal values and prints ">", "<", or "=" based on which one is greater, smaller, or equal.

2. **Correctness of the Conversion**:
   - The conversion from the binary string to a decimal using powers of \( q \) is implemented accurately. Each character in the input string contributes to the total based on its position, where the least significant digit has a weight of \( q^0 \), the next \( q^1 \), and so forth.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After converting both strings, the program correctly compares the two computed decimal values and returns the appropriate operator as the output.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The operations used are efficient and are within the constraints of the problem, given that the maximum length of the strings does not exceed 100,000.

Since all the described operations are followed correctly and all requirements of the problem statement are met, the program is deemed correct.

Overall, the logic, input handling, conversion, and comparison operations align perfectly with the specifications outlined in the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
