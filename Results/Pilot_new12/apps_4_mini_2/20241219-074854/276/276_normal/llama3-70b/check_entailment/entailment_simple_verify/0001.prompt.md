You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program converts the strings representing the numbers in the "golden system" to their decimal values and compares them.

The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a binary-like string representation using the golden ratio base \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The conversion is performed correctly since it reverses the string and correctly evaluates the sum \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \).

The steps performed by the code are:
1. Read two binary strings from input.
2. Convert each string to its decimal equivalent using the `func_1` function.
3. Compare the results and print the appropriate character ('>', '<', '=') based on the comparison.

Let's consider potential edge cases:
- If one of the strings consists entirely of '0's (which should not happen as per the problem description that says the strings are non-empty, but still worth checking).
- Evaluating the strings with significant leading zeros (like `0001` vs `1`).
- Large input sizes up to the 100000 characters, which could affect performance but not correctness.

The program seems to handle normal cases appropriately without missing any potential cases from the problem statement. Furthermore, it treats leading zeros correctly since these would not contribute to the decimal value appropriately.

We conclude that:
1. The function handles conversion as expected by taking the inputs as valid binary-like strings.
2. It correctly computes the weighted sums using the golden ratio.
3. It compares the results and prints the correct output.

After reviewing all possible edge cases and given inputs, no scenarios where the program fails to follow the problem description were identified.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True** 

The program works correctly for the specified golden system comparisons.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is equal to the sum of the binary representations of the strings in `s` converted to decimal with weights based on `q`, specifically the last string has weight 1, and the first string has weight `q` raised to the power of its index position after reversing the list, `i` is 2, `c` is the first character of the first string in `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns decimal, which is the sum of the binary representations of the strings in list 's' converted to decimal, with weights based on q, where the first string has weight q raised to the power of its index position after reversing the list and the last string has weight 1.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
