You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: The provided program attempts to compare two numbers represented in a unique "golden system" by converting these string representations into their decimal values and then comparing them.

Here’s an analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   The program reads two strings of '0's and '1's from input.

2. **Conversion Function**: 
   The `func_1` function converts a binary-like string representation into a decimal value based on the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The conversion uses the relation \( \text{value} = \sum (a_i \cdot q^{n-i}) \).

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   After converting both strings to decimal values, the program compares them and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:
The program does not account for the fact that when both strings have leading zeros, it could affect their binary representation even if their decimal values are equal. For example:

- Input:
  ```
  00100
  11
  ```

  In both cases, their decimal representations are equal. The program's logic would correctly return '='.

However, if we evaluate:
- Input:
  ```
  0110
  110
  ```

  Here:
  - The first number ('0110') evaluates to:
    \( 0 \cdot q^3 + 1 \cdot q^2 + 1 \cdot q^1 + 0 \cdot q^0 = q^2 + q \)
  - The second number ('110') evaluates to:
    \( 1 \cdot q^2 + 1 \cdot q^1 + 0 \cdot q^0 = q^2 + q \)
    
Both expressions yield the same numeric value.

Now let's consider:
- Input:
  ```
  010
  10
  ```
  
  Here '010' evaluates to \( 0 \cdot q^2 + 1 \cdot q^1 + 0 \cdot q^0 = q \), and '10' evaluates to \( 1 \cdot q^1 + 0 \cdot q^0 = q \).
  
The program returns '=', but if there are inputs like '01' and '1', they also yield equal values numerically. The logic in the conversion function works based on the position of digits representing their values accordingly, but this could lead to misinterpretations in subtly incorrect implementations if the program doesn't accommodate for variations in leading zeros appropriately at comparison time.

### Conclusion:
While the current output correctly returns values in given examples, the numerical representations could become ambiguous with leading zeros leading to the implication of equality under wrong assumptions when different representations are compared.

Hence, while the implementation may immediately look correct for the given examples, it does not comprehensively handle every possible edge case where numerical equality could appear divergent due to string formatting and leading zeros. 

Thus, the program is not entirely robust against all edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is equal to the sum of the binary representations of the strings in `s` converted to decimal with weights based on `q`, specifically the last string has weight 1, and the first string has weight `q` raised to the power of its index position after reversing the list, `i` is 2, `c` is the first character of the first string in `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns decimal, which is the sum of the binary representations of the strings in list 's' converted to decimal, with weights based on q, where the first string has weight q raised to the power of its index position after reversing the list and the last string has weight 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `s` containing two non-empty binary strings. It calculates and returns the weighted sum of their decimal values, where each binary string is converted to decimal using weights based on the golden ratio `q`. The first string (originally the last in the provided list due to reversal) is weighted by `q` raised to its position index, while the second string (originally the first in the list) is weighted by 1. The function assumes the input strings are properly formatted with only '0's and '1's, but it does not handle cases where this assumption is violated. If the strings contain non-binary characters, the behavior (error or faulty calculation) is unspecified.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
