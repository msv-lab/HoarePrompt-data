To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze how the program converts the strings representing the numbers in the "golden system" to their decimal values and compares them.

The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a binary-like string representation using the golden ratio base \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The conversion is performed correctly since it reverses the string and correctly evaluates the sum \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \).

The steps performed by the code are:
1. Read two binary strings from input.
2. Convert each string to its decimal equivalent using the `func_1` function.
3. Compare the results and print the appropriate character ('>', '<', '=') based on the comparison.

Let's consider potential edge cases:
- If one of the strings consists entirely of '0's (which should not happen as per the problem description that says the strings are non-empty, but still worth checking).
- Evaluating the strings with significant leading zeros (like `0001` vs `1`).
- Large input sizes up to the 100000 characters, which could affect performance but not correctness.

The program seems to handle normal cases appropriately without missing any potential cases from the problem statement. Furthermore, it treats leading zeros correctly since these would not contribute to the decimal value appropriately.

We conclude that:
1. The function handles conversion as expected by taking the inputs as valid binary-like strings.
2. It correctly computes the weighted sums using the golden ratio.
3. It compares the results and prints the correct output.

After reviewing all possible edge cases and given inputs, no scenarios where the program fails to follow the problem description were identified.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True** 

The program works correctly for the specified golden system comparisons.
