Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input strings may contain non-binary characters (i.e., characters other than '0' and '1'). According to the output hints, the function assumes that the input strings are properly formatted with only '0's and '1's, but does not verify this assumption. Therefore, if a user mistakenly inputs a string with invalid characters (like '2', '3', or any other character), the program could behave unexpectedly or yield incorrect results.

For example, if the input strings were "1002" and "11", the function `func_1` would attempt to parse '2', which is not a valid digit in binary, leading to incorrect or undefined behavior.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, resulting in a **False** correctness status.
