The original assessment states that the provided Python program correctly converts numbers from the "golden system" to their decimal equivalents and compares them correctly based on the problem description. The program's logic seems sound in terms of how it performs the conversion and the comparisons.

However, the output hints introduce a crucial point of concern: they indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input strings may contain non-binary characters. The function `func_1` assumes valid input consisting solely of '0's and '1's. If the assumption is violated, the behavior could be unpredictable, which contradicts the validity of the program in all cases specified by the problem description.

Given that the program may potentially produce erroneous results (or behave unexpectedly) if any input failures occur (even if they were not supposed to happen according to the assumptions), this calls into question the overall correctness of the program.

In light of the output hints and the implications they have for the program's robustness, the original assessment no longer holds up. The program does not account for input validation, which is significant for ensuring correct behavior in all circumstances.

Final: **False**
