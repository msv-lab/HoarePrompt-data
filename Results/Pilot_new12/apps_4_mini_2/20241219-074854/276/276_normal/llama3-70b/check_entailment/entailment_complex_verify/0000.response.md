Based on the provided problem description, the program's functionality, and the annotated version, I will analyze the correctness of the program as follows.

The program is designed to compare two numbers represented in a string format based on the "golden system" which interprets these strings as binary values weighted by powers of the golden ratio \( q \). The `func_1` converts the input binary string into its corresponding decimal value.

### Key Points from the Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of non-empty strings of '0's and '1's which the program correctly assumes and does not validate further since we are assuming valid input.

2. **Conversion Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly reverses the input string and then computes the decimal value based on the golden ratio.
   - The annotated code indicates that leading zeros are not explicitly addressed; however, they inherently do not affect the computed value since the calculation is purely numerical.
   - The function sums the contributions of '0's and '1's correctly based on their respective positions.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After obtaining the decimal values, the program compares them and correctly returns the appropriate symbol.

### Concern Raised in Original Assessment:
The original assessment expressed concern regarding the treatment of leading zeros and similar string representations affecting the perceived equality. However, this concern does not align with the nature of floating-point arithmetic or how comparisons are executed numerically.

### Conclusion:
Upon careful re-evaluation, the program accurately meets the specifications set by the problem description. The program computes the weighted sum correctly using the golden ratio and can reliably compare the resultant decimal values regardless of leading zeros since they do not change the actual computed value from the golden system conversion.

The given annotations do not indicate that the assumptions made during the original assessment are warranted. The representations from the strings lead to decimal conversions that are indeed handled correctly even if two different string formats yield the same decimal value.

Thus, after weighing all evidence and confirming the program's functionality, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
