Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s how it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings containing '0's and '1's as specified in the problem description. The assumption is made that inputs will be valid, as stated.

2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function `func_1(s)` is designed to convert the binary representation provided in the strings into their decimal values using the mathematical property of the golden ratio \( q \). The calculation \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \) is implemented correctly:
   - The input string is reversed to represent the digits correctly based on their positional value, just as required.
   - The loop iterates through each character in the reversed string, converts it to an integer, and calculates its corresponding value using \( q^i \) for the appropriate index \( i \).

3. **Comparison Logic**: After calculating the decimal equivalents of both input strings, the program compares the two values. It employs correct comparison logic, printing '>' if the first number is larger, '<' if it is smaller, or '=' if they are equal, which aligns perfectly with the output specifications in the problem statement.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: The program does not handle erroneous inputs like non-binary characters, but per the problem description, we assume valid binary input will always be given. Therefore, it fulfills the expected functionality without the need for additional input validation.

5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm is efficient enough to handle the upper limit of string length (100,000 characters) within the confines of Pythonâ€™s capabilities, using simple arithmetic operations.

In summary, the program's implementation accurately reflects the requirements set out in the problem description, including correct conversion and comparison of binary strings based on the golden system defined by the value \( q \). Thus, the program is considered correct.
