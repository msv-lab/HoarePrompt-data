The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a list that contains two non-empty strings, each composed entirely of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000. After executing the function body, it calculates the sum of the binary representations of these strings, converting them to decimal. The decimal values are weighted based on their positions in the list, which is reversed prior to the calculation, where the first string will have a weight of \( q \) raised to the power of its index position and the last string has a weight of 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of two binary strings and return the weighted sum of their decimal values based on their positions in the reversed list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `s` of two non-empty binary strings and returns the weighted sum of their decimal values based on their positions after reversing the list.**
