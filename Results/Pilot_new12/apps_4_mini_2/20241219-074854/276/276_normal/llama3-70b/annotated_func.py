#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is equal to the sum of the binary representations of the strings in `s` converted to decimal with weights based on `q`, specifically the last string has weight 1, and the first string has weight `q` raised to the power of its index position after reversing the list, `i` is 2, `c` is the first character of the first string in `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns decimal, which is the sum of the binary representations of the strings in list 's' converted to decimal, with weights based on q, where the first string has weight q raised to the power of its index position after reversing the list and the last string has weight 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `s` containing two non-empty binary strings. It calculates and returns the weighted sum of their decimal values, where each binary string is converted to decimal using weights based on the golden ratio `q`. The first string (originally the last in the provided list due to reversal) is weighted by `q` raised to its position index, while the second string (originally the first in the list) is weighted by 1. The function assumes the input strings are properly formatted with only '0's and '1's, but it does not handle cases where this assumption is violated. If the strings contain non-binary characters, the behavior (error or faulty calculation) is unspecified.
