The function accepts a list `s` containing two non-empty binary strings. It calculates and returns the weighted sum of their decimal values, where each binary string is converted to decimal using weights based on the golden ratio `q`. The first string (originally the last in the provided list due to reversal) is weighted by `q` raised to its position index, while the second string (originally the first in the list) is weighted by 1. The function assumes the input strings are properly formatted with only '0's and '1's, but it does not handle cases where this assumption is violated. If the strings contain non-binary characters, the behavior (error or faulty calculation) is unspecified.
