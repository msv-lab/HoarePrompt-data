#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, where each string consists only of '0' and '1' characters and the length of each string does not exceed 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, `q` is 5, `value` is the result of the weighted sum of the '1's in the string, with each '1' contributing `5
    return value
    #The program returns the result of the weighted sum of the '1's in the string, where each '1' contributes 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings of '0's and '1's. It calculates and returns a weighted sum of the '1's present in the first string of the tuple. Each '1' contributes a value based on its position in the string, using a golden ratio-like factor (approximately 1.618) raised to the power of the index difference from the total length minus one. The second string in the tuple is ignored in the calculation. It's important to note that if `s` contains less than 1 character in its first string or if there are no '1's in the first string, the return value will be 0. The function does not account for any input validation, which may lead to errors if the input format does not match expectations.
