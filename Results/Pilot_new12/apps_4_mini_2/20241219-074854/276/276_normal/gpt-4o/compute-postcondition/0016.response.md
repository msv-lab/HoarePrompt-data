Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings of '0's and '1's. It calculates and returns a weighted sum of the '1's present in the first string of the tuple. Each '1' contributes a value based on its position in the string, using a golden ratio-like factor (approximately 1.618) raised to the power of the index difference from the total length minus one. The second string in the tuple is ignored in the calculation. It's important to note that if `s` contains less than 1 character in its first string or if there are no '1's in the first string, the return value will be 0. The function does not account for any input validation, which may lead to errors if the input format does not match expectations.**
