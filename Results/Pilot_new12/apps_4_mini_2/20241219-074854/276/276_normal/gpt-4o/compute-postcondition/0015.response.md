The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a tuple containing two non-empty strings. Each string in the tuple consists exclusively of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000. The function returns the result of the weighted sum of the '1's in the string, where each '1' contributes 5.
