To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly implements the logic for comparing two numbers represented in the "golden system."

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to compare two numbers represented as strings of '0's and '1's in such a way that they are treated as base \( q \) (where \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \)). The decimal value of the number represented by a string \( a_0a_1...a_n \) is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Value} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i}
\]

Where \( a_i \) is either 0 or 1.

### Verification of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   The program reads two strings from input, strips whitespace, and checks that they consist of '0's and '1's, as required by the problem description. The length constraint is also maintained as the input does not exceed 100000.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` correctly computes the value of a binary string in the golden system. It initializes \( q \) to the golden ratio and iterates over the input string, accumulating the weighted contributions of each '1' in the string (i.e., it adds \( q^{\text{position}} \) for each '1').
   - The calculations performed are appropriate, as they follow the mathematical definition provided for value calculation in the golden system.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After calculating the values for both strings, the program uses simple comparison operators to determine which value is greater or if they are equal, printing the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=').

### Conclusion:
The program effectively computes the values as specified in the problem description and compares them correctly. Therefore, it meets all the requirements set forth in the problem description without any contradictions or overlooked cases.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
