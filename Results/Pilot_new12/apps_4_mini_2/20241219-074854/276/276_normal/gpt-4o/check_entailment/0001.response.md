Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to compare two numbers represented in a "golden system" based on the calculation of their decimal values using the irrational number \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). However, the program has a critical flaw. 

Specifically, the main issue arises from the fact that the method used to compute the values of the strings (function `func_1`) does not address the proper handling of leading zeros in the input strings. In the "golden system," the positions of '1's and '0's in the string impact the value calculated, but the value of strings with leading zeros should not affect the order of the numbers.

For example:
1. Consider the input:
```
001
10
```
The first number translates to \( q^2 \) (because the first '1' is in the 3rd position from the right and '0's in front contribute no value), and the second number translates to \( q^1 \). Specifically:
- For `001`, `value1` would be \( q^2 \).
- For `10`, `value2` would be \( q^1 + 0 \cdot q^0 = q \).

The correct comparison should be:
- \( q^2 < q \) (which is true, since \( q^2 = q + 1 \) implies that \( q^2\) is definitely greater than \( q \)).

However, since `func_1` does not explicitly handle the leading zeros, the program may compute leading zeros inappropriately or miss significant digits entirely.

Thus, the program does not function correctly for cases with leading zeros, making it incorrect for its intended purpose.
