The program provided implements a method to compare two numbers represented in the "golden system" notation, which uses the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). 

The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system. It does this by summing the contributions of each ‘1’ in the string based on its position, effectively applying the golden ratio powers to those positions where there are `1`s. 

However, there is a key issue regarding how the program compares the two numbers. The provided hints mention that `func_1` accepts a tuple `s` containing two non-empty strings but actually, it takes only one string. The output hints also erroneously indicate that it returns a weighted sum from both strings when it only processes the first string, ignoring any contribution from the second string. 

This can lead to incorrect results because:

1. There is no proper handling of cases where strings are of different lengths. For example, `100` and `1111` will provide misleading results since `func_1` is only considering the first string.
2. The logic of the comparison itself relies solely on individual evaluations of `func_1`, potentially leading to inaccuracies if the interpretation of length and position wasn't properly structured.

To summarize:
- For two strings `100` and `111`, the program evaluates each separately but doesn’t properly account for lengths and numeral positioning relative to both numbers.
- The hints provided do not align with what the function does, creating additional confusion regarding performance and capability.

Given these observations, the program does not fulfill the requirements established in the problem description for all potential cases accurately.

Correctness: **False**.
