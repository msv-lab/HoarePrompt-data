The original assessment concludes that the program correctly fulfills the problem description. However, upon reviewing the output hints, it becomes evident that the program handling is flawed. 

Specifically, the output hints point out that the function `func_1` calculates the value only for the first string in the input tuple and ignores the second string entirely. This contradicts the problem description, which requires the comparison of two numbers based on their golden system representations.

Moreover, the evaluation done in `func_1` does produce correct results for the first input string. However, since both strings are supposed to be evaluated and compared, ignoring the second string leads to incorrect comparisons for any input where the importance of the second string's value matters.

Given these discrepancies, the output hints indicate that the program fails to meet the requirement of comparing two strings accurately.

Final: **False**
