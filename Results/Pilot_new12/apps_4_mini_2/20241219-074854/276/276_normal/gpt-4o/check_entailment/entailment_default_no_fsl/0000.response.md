Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the calculations correctly because it only evaluates the first input string and ignores the second input string completely in the `func_1` function. According to the problem description, the program must compare the decimal values of both input strings, but the logic currently implemented only computes the value for the first string. 

For instance, if the input strings are "01" and "10", the first string (with value 1) would be evaluated as `1.618033988^1` after the `func_1` returns the computed value based on the presence of '1's. However, the second string (with value 1) would yield a different numeric representation (`1.618033988^0 + 1.618033988^1`), resulting in a comparison that yields an inaccurate result. 

Thus, since there is at least one case where the program will not give the correct output, the program is considered incorrect.
