The program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-empty strings from input, which consist only of '0's and '1's, in accordance with the requirements of the problem description.

2. **Conversion to Decimal Value**: The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value based on the "golden system" described in the problem statement. It correctly iterates over the binary-style string, using the formula relating to the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

3. **Weighted Sum Calculation**: The loop within `func_1` correctly adds the contributions of '1's based on their position, effectively calculating the weighted sum of the string as described. The contributions of '0's are not added to the value, which aligns with the notion that they have no effect on the overall decimal value in this system.

4. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the decimal values for both input strings, the program compares these values and prints '>', '<', or '=' based on their relative sizes, consistent with the output specifications of the problem description.

5. **Correctness in Edge Cases**: Given the problem states the input will be valid and there are no empty strings or invalid characters, the assumptions hold true for the validation conditions in the code. Since both strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and consist of valid characters, the function should always work correctly.

Given these checks, the program correctly adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
