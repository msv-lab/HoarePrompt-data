The function `func` does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on a collection of test files, which are described with a unique filename followed by a type indicator ("1" for example tests and "0" for regular tests). The function processes a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of these test files. Each filename is a string consisting of digits and lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 6 characters. The function's output is not explicitly stated, but based on typical behavior for such functions, it likely organizes or categorizes the test files based on their type indicators and may return a structured output such as a summary or list of files. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a count of test files, processes them based on their type indicators, and likely returns an organized output of the test files.**
