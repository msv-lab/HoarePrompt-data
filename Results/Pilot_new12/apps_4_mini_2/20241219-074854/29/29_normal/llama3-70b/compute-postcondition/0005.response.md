According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, with `_` being the loop variable that increments with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, which indicates that this is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `_` will become 1, and the loop will execute again as long as `_` is less than `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), it is important that `n` remains the same for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 1, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string, `files` contains a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` added to it.**
