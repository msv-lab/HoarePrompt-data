According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `examples` list. Since the loop iterates over `examples`, it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The enumeration starts with `i` being initialized to 1 at the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `examples` is not empty, and at the start of the loop, `i` is 1 and `file` is the first element in the `examples` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `file` is the first element in `examples`.**
