The variable `n` is reassigned the value from `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous condition of `n` being a positive integer in the specified range remains valid, but the specific value of `n` now becomes the input integer. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), with `n` being the input integer.**
