The line of code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` updates the `script` list by appending a formatted string that combines the current values of `file` and `i`. 

- `file` is the first element in `regular`, meaning its value is determined by the contents of `regular`.
- `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, where `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `file` is the first element in `regular`,
- `i` equals the number of elements in `examples` plus one.

Since the value of `script` is not defined in the initial state, I will assume it is an empty list or initialized prior to this operation. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects the updated variables:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `regular` must be a non-empty iterable, `file` is the first element in `regular`, and `script` contains an appended value 'move {file} {i}' where {file} is the first element in regular and {i} is `len(examples) + 1`.**
