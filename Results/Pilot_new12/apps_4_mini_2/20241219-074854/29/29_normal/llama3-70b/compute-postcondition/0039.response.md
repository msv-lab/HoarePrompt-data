Functionality: **The function processes a specified number of test files based on their types, where each file consists of a name and a type indicator (either "1" for example tests or "0" for regular tests). It collects the names of the files into two separate lists: one for example files and another for regular files. After sorting the combined list of files by their type (with example tests prioritized), it generates a series of instructions to "move" each file, enumerating them appropriately based on their type. Finally, it prints the total number of generated instructions followed by each instruction. Edge cases include scenarios where there are no example files or no regular files, which would lead to a different instruction set structure but still produce valid output. The function does not return any values; it directly prints the results to the console.**
