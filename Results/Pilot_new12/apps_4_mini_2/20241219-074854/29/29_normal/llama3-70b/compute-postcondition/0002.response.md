According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop will execute exactly `n` times. At the start of the loop, the variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`, but since it is not used in the loop body, it has no effect on the state outside the loop.

Since `files` is an empty list and is not used to determine the loop execution, it does not need to be adjusted as its state is irrelevant to the operation of the loop.

Thus, the key states to note would be that `n` is a positive integer, and `_` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 0**
