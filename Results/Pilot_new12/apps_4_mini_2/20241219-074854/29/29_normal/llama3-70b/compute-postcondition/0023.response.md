According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `regular` collection. The loop uses `enumerate` on `regular`, with `i` starting from `len(examples) + 1`. 

To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

1. We know `n` is a positive integer, which is not directly relevant to the loop execution since it doesn't impact `regular`.
2. The important factor is the `regular` iterable. For the loop to execute, `regular` must contain at least one element. If `regular` is empty, the loop will not run.
3. The loop variable `i` will start at `len(examples) + 1`, so we need to assert what the initial value of `i` should be.
4. The variable `file` will take on the values of elements from `regular`, starting from the first element.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we must confirm that `regular` is a non-empty iterable so that the loop can perform its iterations successfully.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `regular` must be a non-empty iterable, `file` is the first element in `regular`**
