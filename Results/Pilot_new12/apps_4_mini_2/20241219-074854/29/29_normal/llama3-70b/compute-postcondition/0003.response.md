The variables `name` and `type_` are assigned the values from the input, which are split from a single line of input. The variable `_` remains unchanged, and `n` still holds its valid range of positive integers. The output will indicate that `name` and `type_` have been set based on the user input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 0, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string**
