The `script` list will have a new element appended to it. The value being appended is a formatted string that includes the value of `file` (which is the third element in `examples`) and the value of `i` (which is 3). The initial state indicates that `n` remains unchanged, `examples` retains at least 3 elements, `file` corresponds to the third element in `examples`, and `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` must have at least 3 elements, `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3, and `script` now has an additional entry formatted as `move {file} {i}`.**
