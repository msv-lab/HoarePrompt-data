According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `examples` list. The loop will iterate over the elements of the list, and since `i` is currently 1 (representing the first element), we can infer the following:

- At the end of the last iteration, `examples` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is currently 1. The `file` variable contains the first element of `examples`.
- The `enumerate` function starts counting from 1 (due to the `start=1` argument), so for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to 2, and `file` should be set to the second element in `examples`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `examples` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `file` is the second element in `examples`, `script` contains 'move {file} 1'**
