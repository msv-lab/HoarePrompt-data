According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of elements in `examples`. The loop starts at index 1 and continues until the length of `examples`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `file` is the second element in `examples`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `examples` must have at least 3 elements, `i` will increment to 3, and `file` will be the third element in `examples`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` must have at least 3 elements, `file` is the third element in `examples`, `i` is 3**
