The code `print(line)` outputs the value of `line`. Based on the given initial state, it is specified that `line` is the next entry in `script` after the one that was printed. Therefore, the value of `line` is determined by the contents of `script`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and since `line` is printed, it implies that `line` is accessible and its value can be determined based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `regular` is a non-empty iterable, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` contains at least 2 entries, and `line` is the next entry in `script` after the one that was printed.**
