In the given scenario, the variable `regular` is assigned a new list created by iterating through the `files` list. The list comprehension filters `files` to include only those elements (tuples) where the second element is `0`. The original lists `files` and `examples` remain unaffected apart from what has been assigned to `regular`. 

The variable `examples` includes first elements of tuples where the second element equals `1`, but it does not influence the new assignment. `n` is simply a parameter that specifies the constraints of input but does not change.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code is as follows: 
- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `files` remains sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (`type_`)
- `examples` remains a list of the first elements from tuples in `files` where the second element equals 1
- `regular` now contains only the first elements of those tuples in `files` where the second element is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (type_); `examples` is a list of first elements from tuples in `files` where the second element equals 1; `regular` contains the first elements of those tuples in `files` where the second element is 0.**
