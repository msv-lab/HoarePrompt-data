The code assigns new values to the variables `name` and `type_` through user input, which will replace any previous values they held. Other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. The output state now reflects that `name` and `type_` have taken on new input values while also mentioning the inclusion of these new values in `files`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 1, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string, `files` contains a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` added to it.**
