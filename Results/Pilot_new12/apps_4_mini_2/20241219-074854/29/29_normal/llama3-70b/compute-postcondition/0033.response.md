According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. If `script` contains more than 1 entry, the loop can execute again for the next line. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is printed and `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, which implies that the loop has already processed the first entry of `script`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `script` must have at least one more entry (making the total entries in `script` at least 2), and `line` must be assigned the next entry in `script`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `regular` is a non-empty iterable, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` contains at least 2 entries, and `line` is the next entry in `script` after the one that was printed.**
