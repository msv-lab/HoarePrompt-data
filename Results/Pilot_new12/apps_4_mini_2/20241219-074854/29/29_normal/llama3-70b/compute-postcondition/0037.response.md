To analyze the output state after the loop completes, we start by determining what must be true about the `script` variable based on the code provided. The loop iterates over each `line` in `script`, and if `script` contains a certain number of entries, that directly affects the values of `line` and the variables after all iterations.

### Overall Assessment:

- The loop will execute as many times as there are entries in `script`.
- Since `regular` is specified to be a non-empty iterable, if `script` is determined based on `len(regular)`, then it must contain entries derived from that non-empty state.
- At the end of the loop, `line` will represent the last entry of `script`, assuming `script` has a number of entries equal to or exceeding the number of iterations executed.

### Final Output State:

Assuming that `script` has `m` entries (where `m` is a positive integer derived from `len(regular)`), the output once the loop finishes executing is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `regular` is a non-empty iterable, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` contains `m` entries (where m is at least 1), and `line` is the last entry in `script`.**
