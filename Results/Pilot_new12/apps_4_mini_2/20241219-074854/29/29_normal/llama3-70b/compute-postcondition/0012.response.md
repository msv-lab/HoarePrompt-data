The code sorts the `files` list in place based on the second element of each tuple (the integer `type_`), in descending order. Since `n` is a positive integer in the specified range and `files` contains `n` tuples, the previous state indicates that `files` consists of these tuples with their most recent `name` and `type_` values. However, the specific values of the tuples are not provided, so the output will reflect that `files` is now sorted, without specifying the exact content of the tuples.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (type_).**
