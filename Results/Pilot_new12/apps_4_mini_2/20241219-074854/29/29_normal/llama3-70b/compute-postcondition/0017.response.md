The code appends a formatted string to the `script` list, which includes the `file` and `i`. The variable `file` is the first element in `examples`, and `i` has a value of 1. The values of `n`, `examples`, and `i` do not change, but `script` now contains a new entry. The output will describe the state of the relevant variables after execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `file` is the first element in `examples`, `script` contains 'move {file} 1'**.
