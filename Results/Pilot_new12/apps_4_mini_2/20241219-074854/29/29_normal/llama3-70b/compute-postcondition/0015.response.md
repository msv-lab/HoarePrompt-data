The variable `script` is initialized as an empty list. The states of the other variables `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular` are not affected, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (type_); `examples` is a list of first elements from tuples in `files` where the second element equals 1; `regular` contains the first elements of those tuples in `files` where the second element is 0; `script` is an empty list.**
