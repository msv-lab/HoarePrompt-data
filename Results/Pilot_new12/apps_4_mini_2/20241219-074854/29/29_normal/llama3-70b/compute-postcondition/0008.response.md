According to the code, the loop will continue to execute while `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `_` will be 2 after this iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string, `files` contains a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` appended to it.**
