According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `regular` iterable. The loop will iterate over each element in `regular`, and for it to execute one more time, `regular` must contain at least `len(examples) + 3` elements. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(examples) + 2` and `file` is the current element in `regular`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented to `len(examples) + 3` and `file` should be the next element in `regular`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + 3`, `regular` must be an iterable with at least `len(examples) + 3` elements, `file` is the next element in `regular`, and `script` contains the appended value 'move {file} {i}' where {file} is the next element in `regular` and {i} is `len(examples) + 3`.**
