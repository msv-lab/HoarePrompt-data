The code snippet appends a tuple consisting of the `name` and the integer value of `type_` to the `files` list. The variables `n`, `_`, `name`, and `type_` remain unaffected by this operation, but `files` is updated. Since `name` is an input string and `type_` is converted to an integer using `int()`, `files` now contains an entry with those values.

After executing the code, the states of the relevant variables are as follows:
- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `_` remains 0.
- `name` is the same input string as provided.
- `type_` is the same input string; however, as an integer, it will represent `int(type_)`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the new state of the `files` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 0, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string, `files` contains a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` added to it.**
