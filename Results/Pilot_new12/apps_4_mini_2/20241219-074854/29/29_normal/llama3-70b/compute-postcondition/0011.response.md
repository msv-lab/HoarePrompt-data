To analyze the output state of the loop after all iterations have completed, we consider that the loop runs exactly `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. During each iteration, a tuple consisting of `name` and `int(type_)` is added to the `files` list.

After the loop executes:
- `files` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the input from each iteration.
- `name` will hold the last input string associated with the last executed iteration.
- `type_` will hold the last input string associated with the last executed iteration.
- The loop's control variable `_` will have been incremented from 0 to `n-1`, so it will be `n-1` after the last iteration.

Therefore, taking into account that there won’t be any input if `n` is 0, we deduce the final state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` contains `n` tuples in the form of `(name, int(type_))`, 'name' and 'type_' hold the last input values given, and `_` is `n-1`.**
