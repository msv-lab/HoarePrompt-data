`examples` is assigned a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1. The values of `n` remain unchanged, and `files` being sorted in descending order based on the second element is also unchanged. However, `examples` depends on `files`, and the content of `examples` will vary based on the elements in `files`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (type_); `examples` is a list of first elements from tuples in `files` where the second element equals 1.**
