The `print(len(script))` statement outputs the length of the `script` list. The `script` variable is defined as containing all appended values 'move {file} {j}' for each file in `regular`, starting from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)`. Therefore, the length of `script` corresponds to the number of files in `regular`, which is equal to `len(regular)` as each file contributes one entry to the `script`.

The variables `n`, `examples`, `i`, and `file` remain unchanged during this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `regular` is a non-empty iterable, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` contains `len(regular)` entries.**
