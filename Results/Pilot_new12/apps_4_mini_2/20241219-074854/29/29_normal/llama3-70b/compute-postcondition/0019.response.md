The variable `script` is updated to include a new string that is constructed using the values of `file` and `i`. The value of `file` is the second element in `examples`, and `i` is currently 2. Therefore, the new entry added to the `script` list will be formatted as 'move {file} 2'.

The variables `n`, `examples`, and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated state of `script` with the new entry.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `file` is the second element in `examples`, `script` contains 'move {file} 1' and 'move {file} 2'**
