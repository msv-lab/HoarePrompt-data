To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the state at the conclusion of the loop based primarily on the provided initial state and the condition for the loop execution.

From the information given:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
   - `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (type_).
   - `examples` is a list of first elements from tuples in `files` where the second element equals 1.
   - `regular` contains the first elements of those tuples in `files` where the second element is 0.
   - `script` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```
   for i, file in enumerate(examples, start=1):
       script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
   ```

The loop will iterate over the `examples` list, and for each element, it will append a formatted string to `script`. The variable `i` will increment starting from 1 for each element in `examples`.

3. **Output State after the Loop:**
   - If the loop executes:
     - `examples` must contain at least `k` elements where `k` is the number of iterations (1 to `len(examples)`).
     - `i` will be equal to `len(examples)` after all iterations have completed.
     - `file` will be the last element in `examples`.
     - `script` will contain strings of the form `'move {file} {iteration_number}'` for each file in `examples`.

If the loop does not execute, it means `examples` is empty, in which case:
- `script` remains an empty list.
- `i` is not defined or pointed to its initial condition as the loop doesn't initiate.

Considering both scenarios, the output state can be stated as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements; `i` is `len(examples)`, `file` is the last element in `examples`, `script` contains 'move {file} {j}' for each `j` from 1 to `len(examples)` if `examples` is non-empty; if `examples` is empty, `script` is empty.**
