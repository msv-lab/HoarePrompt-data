The code appends a new tuple containing `name` and `int(type_)` to the `files` list. The initial state mentions that `name` and `type_` are input strings, and since `type_` is converted to an integer using `int(type_)`, the value of `type_` is transformed accordingly. However, the actual values of `name` and `type_` are not specified. Therefore, `files` is updated to include the new tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `name` and `type_` are input strings, `files` contains the previous elements plus a new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
