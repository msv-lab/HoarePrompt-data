The code appends a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to `files`. The specifics of `name` and `type_` are input strings, and `int(type_)` converts the value of `type_` (which is expected to be a string representing an integer) to an integer. The initial state does not provide the exact values of `name` and `type_`, nor the current contents of `files`. However, since `files` is modified by appending a new entry, this must be reflected in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `_` is 1, `name` is an input string, `type_` is an input string, `files` contains a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` appended to it.**
