Correctness: **False**.

The provided program fails to correctly handle the case where the filenames of the files being moved to are already takenâ€”this can lead to filename conflicts and overwrites. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
a 1
b 0
c 0
```
This means we have three files: "a" (example), "b" (regular), and "c" (regular). The expected output after executing the moves should result in:
```
1 -> a
2 -> b
3 -> c
```

However, in the `script` building loop, the following lines would be generated:
```
move a 1
move b 2
move c 3
```

But if we had filenames that initially start from 1 and 2 (like "1", "2") and we instructed the program to move "b" and "c" into "1" and "2", it would overwrite files instead of moving them correctly to distinct numbered filenames.

This can also lead to cases where the `move` commands assume the destination files are available when, in fact, they might be overwritten or nonexistent due to previous operations. Therefore, the logic to ensure that files are moved to distinct targets without overwriting existing files isn't adequately implemented.

Thus, due to the potential for overwriting and the current logic to handle name conflicts being insufficient, this program does not satisfy the problem's requirements in all cases.
