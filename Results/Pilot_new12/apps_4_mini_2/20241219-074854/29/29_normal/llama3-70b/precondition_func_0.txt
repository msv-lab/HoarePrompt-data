n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of test files, and each test file is described by a unique filename followed by a type indicator ("1" for example tests and "0" for regular tests). Filenames are strings containing digits and lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 6 characters.
