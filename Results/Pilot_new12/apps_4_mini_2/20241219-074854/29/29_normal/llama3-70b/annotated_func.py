#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of test files, and each test file is described by a unique filename followed by a type indicator ("1" for example tests and "0" for regular tests). Filenames are strings containing digits and lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 6 characters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` contains `n` tuples in the form of `(name, int(type_))`, 'name' and 'type_' hold the last input values given, and `_` is `n-1`.
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements; `i` is `len(examples)`, `file` is the last element in `examples`, `script` contains 'move {file} {j}' for each `j` from 1 to `len(examples)` if `examples` is non-empty; if `examples` is empty, `script` is empty.
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `regular` is a non-empty iterable, `file` is the last element in `regular`, and `script` contains all the appended values 'move {file} {j}' for each file in `regular` starting from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `examples` is a list with `len(examples)` elements, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `regular` is a non-empty iterable, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `script` contains `m` entries (where m is at least 1), and `line` is the last entry in `script`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test files based on their types, where each file consists of a name and a type indicator (either "1" for example tests or "0" for regular tests). It collects the names of the files into two separate lists: one for example files and another for regular files. After sorting the combined list of files by their type (with example tests prioritized), it generates a series of instructions to "move" each file, enumerating them appropriately based on their type. Finally, it prints the total number of generated instructions followed by each instruction. Edge cases include scenarios where there are no example files or no regular files, which would lead to a different instruction set structure but still produce valid output. The function does not return any values; it directly prints the results to the console.
