You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to examine the logic of the code in detail.

### Analyzing the Program

The program is intended to rename files according to the specifications given, ensuring that:
1. Files that are examples (type '1') come first with names "1", "2", ..., "e" where e is the total number of examples.
2. Regular files (type '0') follow the examples, named "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of files.

The function `func_1` processes the list of files and separates them into two lists: `examples` and `regulars`. It attempts to generate move commands that transition the files to their new names.

### Potential Issues

1. **Overwriting Names**: The logic for renaming files involves checking if the target names are already in use (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`). However, the loop condition for `temp_counter` assumes it will always find an available name within `2 * n`, which may not be guaranteed if the input file names are complex (as they could be longer than just simple digits) or in cases where the existing file names collide.
   
2. **Confusion with Temporary Renaming**: The handling of examples and regulars could result in overwriting targets that have already been reassigned or garnered adjustments. The code may lead to scenarios where a move command is attempted twice for the same names, leading to incorrect results, especially if multiple files share a complex renaming pattern or have similar original names.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**: Specific edge cases like having all files as examples or having non-sequential filenames such as "99", "100", or similar can lead to confusing results if the renaming mechanism doesn't handle such disparities appropriately. If n is small, such as `n = 1` or `n = 2`, it would be prudent to evaluate this against the full requirement of the renaming strategy.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, a discrepancy exists between how the renaming targets are calculated and the description's requirements of unique sequential naming without potential overwrites. Thus, the code does not handle all potential cases effectively.

**Example Case:**
- For inputs such as:
   ```
   3
   a 0
   b 1
   1 0
   ```
   The correct moves should yield:
   ```
   move b 1
   move a 2
   ```
   However, the logic in the function could mismanage reassignments.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and files is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6) and a type (an integer 0 or 1 representing a regular test or an example test respectively). The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is '1', `regulars` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is not '1'.
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, in `examples` each name corresponds to its index in the list (i.e., `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)` for all `i` in the range of the length of `examples`). `moves` contains strings in the format 'move {original_example} {target}', where `original_example` is the name from `examples` that was not equal to its index + 1 at any point, and `target` is the final value of `temp_counter` which is greater than or equal to `n + 1` if the loop executed. `temp_counter` is equal to the greatest incremented value encountered during the execution of the loop or remains `n + 1` if it never enters the while loop.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains string representations of integers ranging from its original state to `2 * n + 1`, and `moves` reflects all necessary transitions based on the updates made during loop execution.
    return moves
    #The program returns the list 'moves' reflecting all necessary transitions based on the updates made during loop execution, pertaining to the structure of 'files' containing 'n' tuples and 'regulars' containing string representations of integers from its original state to '2 * n + 1'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of file tuples, each containing a filename and a type indicator (either a regular test or an example test). It separates these files into two lists: `examples` for example tests indicated by type '1', and `regulars` for regular tests indicated by type '0'. The function then adjusts the filenames in both lists according to specific conditions, ensuring that the names correspond to their index positions. If the example filenames do not match the expected numerical naming (based on their index), the function generates a series of 'move' commands that indicate the necessary changes to maintain the desired naming convention. The same process is applied to the regular filenames, with the target names determined based on their respective order. After processing all files, it returns a list of these move commands, reflecting the necessary transitions made to ensure that the filenames correspond correctly to their expected values. Additionally, the function handles situations where target names may already exist, by incrementing a temporary counter up to double the integer `n` to find a suitable target, thereby preventing name collisions.
