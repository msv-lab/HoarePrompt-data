You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Parsing Input**: The program reads the number of test files, `n`, and then reads `n` lines containing file names and their types (1 for examples and 0 for regular tests).
  
2. **Separating Examples and Regular Tests**: The program separates the file names into two lists: `examples` for test files that are of type 1, and `regulars` for those of type 0.

3. **Renaming Logic**: The program then attempts to rename the files:
   - It uses a variable `temp_counter` starting from `n + 1` to generate new names when there are conflicts.
   - It first renames the example files to their desired positions (1 through e, where e is the count of examples).
   - It then renames the regular files to fill the positions after the examples (e + 1 through n).

4. **Outputting Moves**: Finally, it constructs a list of move commands and prints the count and the moves themselves.

### Checking the Implementation Against Potential Cases

While analyzing the logic, let's identify potential issues:

- **Conflict Management**: The program has logic to manage conflicts when a file name being moved already exists. However, the while loop aimed at avoiding such conflicts checks only up to `2*n`, which may not cover all scenarios if files greater than `n` are moving.
  
- **Edge Cases**: Consider the following edge cases:
  - If `n` is the maximum value (100,000). The implementation must handle this without exceeding computational limits or achieving erroneous behavior.
  - If all files are examples (all have type `1`), the renaming must ensure that the output names do not overlap and are strictly numbered.

### Example Case That Could Fail

1. **Case where `names` contain values that after renaming cause conflicts.** 
   
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     a 1
     b 1
     1 0
     ```
   - The expected output would be the renaming of files:
     ```
     move a 1
     move b 2
     ```
   - However, the program may incorrectly handle renaming `1` if already exists, as it doesn't guarantee that the place where `1` could be placed isn't existing already and moves to `4` should have a better conflict handling.

With these points considered, it's evident that there are scenarios that the program may not handle logically. 

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False** 

The provided code does not correctly manage all potential cases, specifically where the renaming could result in conflicts. It fails to adequately navigate through the possible names when moving files around, particularly when running out of predefined names and introducing conditions where overlaps could occur without a graceful management plan. Hence, it is likely to fail for some cases that need more careful handling.


Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and files is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6) and a type (an integer 0 or 1 representing a regular test or an example test respectively). The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.
