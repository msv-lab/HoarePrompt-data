The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, so after the increment, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', and `regulars[i]` is the string representation of `2 * n + 1`.**
