The code updates the `examples` list at index `i` (which is `2`) with the string representation of `temp_counter`. The initial condition states that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, ensuring that the string version of `temp_counter` can be converted to a string and assigned to `examples[2]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, moves now includes an entry formatted as 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}', and `examples[2]` is now `str(temp_counter)`.**
