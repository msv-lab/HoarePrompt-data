The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be adjusted to a value of `2 * n`, and considering that `temp_counter` can range from 0 to `2 * n - 1`, after the increment, `temp_counter` can take values from 1 to `2 * n`. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is adjusted to the value of `temp_counter + 1`, which is between 1 and `2 * n`.**
