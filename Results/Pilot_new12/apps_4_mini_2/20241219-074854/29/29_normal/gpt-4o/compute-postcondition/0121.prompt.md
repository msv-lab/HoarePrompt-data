You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and files is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6) and a type (an integer 0 or 1 representing a regular test or an example test respectively). The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is '1', `regulars` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is not '1'.
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, in `examples` each name corresponds to its index in the list (i.e., `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)` for all `i` in the range of the length of `examples`). `moves` contains strings in the format 'move {original_example} {target}', where `original_example` is the name from `examples` that was not equal to its index + 1 at any point, and `target` is the final value of `temp_counter` which is greater than or equal to `n + 1` if the loop executed. `temp_counter` is equal to the greatest incremented value encountered during the execution of the loop or remains `n + 1` if it never enters the while loop.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains string representations of integers ranging from its original state to `2 * n + 1`, and `moves` reflects all necessary transitions based on the updates made during loop execution.
    return moves
    #The program returns the list 'moves' reflecting all necessary transitions based on the updates made during loop execution, pertaining to the structure of 'files' containing 'n' tuples and 'regulars' containing string representations of integers from its original state to '2 * n + 1'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples files, and returns a list reflecting necessary transitions based on the updates made during execution involving the files.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list 'moves' reflecting all necessary transitions based on the updates made during loop execution, pertaining to the structure of 'files' containing 'n' tuples and 'regulars' containing string representations of integers from its original state to '2 * n + 1'.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
