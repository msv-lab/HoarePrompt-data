To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop conditions based on the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

This means two things must be true for the loop to execute again:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

Given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, which implies `files_set` is at least as large as `n`
- `i` is 1 (this variable isn't directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `temp_counter` is now greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, indicating it could be anywhere from `previous_value + 1` to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`, indicating that for the loop to continue at the next iteration, `temp_counter + 1` should yield a string which exists in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`, we need to ensure `temp_counter + 1` maintains all necessary conditions:
- `temp_counter` should be less than `2 * n` to ensure the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` holds for one more iteration.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must also be in `files_set`. If `temp_counter + 1` can produce a string that does not exist in `files_set`, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that:
1. `temp_counter` is not equal to `2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set` (which requires no modifications to files_set as per the current statement).

Thus, we can maintain the existing values in the `files_set` state, while ensuring `temp_counter` accommodates the first condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**
