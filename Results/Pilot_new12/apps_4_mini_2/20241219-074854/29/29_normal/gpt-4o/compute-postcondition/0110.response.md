To analyze the output state after the while loop executes, we need to consider the conditions and changes in the variables involved. 

The provided loop increments `temp_counter` while `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and while the string of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`. 

Based on the provided output states after the loop executes certain times, we can summarize our findings:

- **Initial state**: 
  - `n` is a positive integer. 
  - `files` is a list containing `n` tuples.
  - `regulars` contains at least 1 element.
  - `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`.
  - `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`.

**Loop execution insights:**
- After executing once, `temp_counter` is 1, which indicates that `str(1)` is found in `files_set`.
- After executing twice, `temp_counter` is 2, which indicates `str(2)` is also in `files_set`.
- After executing three times, `temp_counter` is 4. This indicates that `str(3)` must be a part of `files_set`. 

To evaluate what happens after the loop has executed as many times as allowed, let's consider the following:

- The loop can continue executing as long as `temp_counter` values from 1 up to at least 2 * n are available in `files_set`.
- For the loop to execute fully without halting early, `files_set` must include the string representations of all `temp_counter` values from 1 up to the point where `temp_counter` exceeds 2 * n.
- Once `temp_counter` exceeds 2 * n, the loop terminates.

Thus, upon completion:

- The final value of `temp_counter` would be `2 * n + 1` since it would increment one last time before the loop condition fails.
- `files_set` must contain all integer string representations from 1 to `2 * n`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`**
