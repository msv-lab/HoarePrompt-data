The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` will still be valid as it will now be equal to `temp_counter + 1`, which is still less than `2 * n`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 and is still less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
