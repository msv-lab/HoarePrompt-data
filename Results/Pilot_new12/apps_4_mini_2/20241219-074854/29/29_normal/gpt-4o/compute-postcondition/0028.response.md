According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `n`, as well as the presence of `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`. The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set` hold true.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `temp_counter` has been increased by 1.
  
For the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `n` is at least 2, `2 * n` is at least 4. Therefore, if `temp_counter` after increasing is less than or equal to 4, the first condition will hold true.
2. The second condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` must also hold true for the loop to proceed.

If we let `temp_counter` at the end of the last iteration be `x`, for the loop to execute again:
- `x` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Additionally, `x` must correspond to a string representation that exists in `files_set`.

Since we don't have specific values for `temp_counter`, `n`, or `files_set`, we can't specify the exact values. However, we can note that:
- Given `n` is at least 2, we need `temp_counter`, after being increased, to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, meaning `temp_counter` cannot exceed `4` after the increment to still allow the first condition to hold.
- For the second condition to also be true, the relevant `str(temp_counter)` value must be in `files_set`.

Thus, the inferred adjustments are:
- `temp_counter` should remain within the limits set by `2 * n` and must be found in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n**
