Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must have at least 1 tuple where `file` is the first tuple; `name` is the first part of `file`, and `type_` is the second part of `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', `examples` now contains `name`. Otherwise, if `type_` is not equal to '1', `regulars` now includes `name`.***
