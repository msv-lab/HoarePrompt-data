To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions stated in the `while` loop:

1. The loop will continue as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is a positive integer,
   - `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1, must be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`,
   - `str(temp_counter)` must currently be in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1, let's denote the value after incrementation as `temp_counter' = temp_counter + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `temp_counter'` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` (this translates to `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`).
- `str(temp_counter')` must be present in `files_set`.

Now, since we know `temp_counter` is currently ≤ `2 * n + 1`, if it is already at maximum allowable value (i.e., `2 * n + 1`), it would not satisfy the first condition for the next iteration unless `temp_counter` is adjusted downward.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need to restrict `temp_counter` such that it must now be ≤ `2 * n - 1`.
- We also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter')` (which would be `str(temp_counter + 1)`) is contained within `files_set`.

Therefore, the statements need to be modified:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` must be <= `2 * n - 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
