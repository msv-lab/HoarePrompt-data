The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous condition states that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2*n`, which means that after the increment, `temp_counter` will be at most `2*n + 1`. No other variables are affected by this operation. All other variables maintain their original conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must be <= `2*n + 1`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
