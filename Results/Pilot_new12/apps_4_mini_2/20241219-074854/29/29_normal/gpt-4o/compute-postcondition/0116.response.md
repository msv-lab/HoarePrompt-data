In the provided scenario, the code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The format of the new string is defined by the variables `regulars[i]` and `target`. 

1. The initial conditions state that `regulars[i]` has been updated to `str(2 * n + 1)`.
2. The value of `target` is not specified but mentioned as a variable present in the context.
3. The `moves` list, which already contains a previous move `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`, will now include an additional entry formatted with the current value of `regulars[i]` and the unspecified `target`.
4. Therefore, the specific string being appended will be `move {str(2 * n + 1)} {target}`.

The state of the other variables is unaffected. We retain `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `files_set` unchanged. The only update occurs in the `moves` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element and `regulars[i]` is '2 * n + 1', `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}' and now also 'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {target}'.**
