The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer with a constraint of \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `files`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `files` contains a `filename` (a string of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6) and a `type` (an integer that is either 0 or 1). The filenames in the list are guaranteed to be distinct.

After executing the function, it returns a list called 'moves'. This list reflects all necessary transitions based on the updates made during the loop execution, pertaining to the structure of 'files' containing 'n' tuples. Additionally, another resulting structure, 'regulars', contains string representations of integers from its original state to '2 * n + 1'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files`, and to return a list that captures the necessary transitions based on the contents of `files`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples files, and returns a list reflecting necessary transitions based on the updates made during execution involving the files.**
