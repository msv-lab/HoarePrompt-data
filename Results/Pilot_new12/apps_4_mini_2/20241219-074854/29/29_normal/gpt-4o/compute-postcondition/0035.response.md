Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 1 name, and `moves` now includes the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`. The current value of `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter) + 1`, and it is true that `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`. Additionally, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.***
