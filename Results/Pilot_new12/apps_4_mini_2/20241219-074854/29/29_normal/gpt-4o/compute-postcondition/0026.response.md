To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the condition defined in the `while` loop. The loop continues as long as both `temp_counter` is less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` is found in `files_set`.

Given the current state:
- `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 2`.
- The condition for the loop is `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

Since `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, we can set up an inequality:  
`n + 2 <= 2 * n`

Rearranging this, we find that:  
`2 <= n`  
Since `n` is a positive integer, this condition is satisfied if `n` is 2 or greater.

Next, we must also ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. Currently, since `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 2`, and assuming `n` is 2 or greater (as found above), `str(temp_counter)` will be equal to `str(n + 2)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `n` must be at least 2.
2. `str(n + 2)` needs to be present in `files_set`.

The current state of examples must be such that `current value of examples[i]` is not equal to `string representation of i + 1`, ensuring the continuation of the loop based on `i`.

To adjust the states so that the loop can continue, we need to maintain the conditions of `temp_counter`, which remains the same, and ensure that:
- `str(n + 2)` is in `files_set`.

So, we need to clarify that `n` must equal or exceed 2, and we donâ€™t need to adjust `i` since it is based on the examples.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, and str(n + 2) must be in files_set**
