According to the code, the loop can execute if the two conditions in the `while` statement are true: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. 

Right before the loop, we have the following states:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list containing `n` tuples.
- `i` is 1 (not directly affecting the loop conditions).
- `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, which contradicts `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the states:
1. Since `temp_counter` is currently greater than `2 * n`, this condition is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to change `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. 
2. Additionally, since `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, we need to ensure that this condition is satisfied as well. Thus, we need to modify either `temp_counter` so that it corresponds to a string that exists in `files_set`, or `files_set` to contain `str(temp_counter)`.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that we need to adjust `temp_counter` to be within the required range and also make sure it's in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
