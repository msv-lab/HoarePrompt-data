To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` statement:

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omit
```

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Additionally, it must hold that `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

2. **State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is currently 1.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer (which means `2 * n` will be at least 2 since `n` must be at least 1), `temp_counter` (which is 1) is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the first condition holds.
   - However, we currently do not know if `str(1)` is present in `files_set`. 

3. **Adjustments for Loop Continuation**:
   - **Assuming `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**: If `str(temp_counter)` is already in `files_set`, then no adjustments are necessary. But since we need to consider that it might need adjustments for the loop to continue, we can't be certain without additional information.
   - **Condition for potential execution**: If `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, we need to ensure it gets included for the loop to execute again. We can set the condition that `str(temp_counter)` must be present.

4. **Final Adjustment Decision**:
   - Given that we need the loop to run one more time, we must ensure that `str(temp_counter)` (which is `'1'`) is in `files_set`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment to ensure the loop can execute one more time would focus on `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is 1, and `str(1)` must be in `files_set`**
