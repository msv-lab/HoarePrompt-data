Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, and `examples` has at least 1 name. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` now includes the string `move {str(temp_counter) + 1} 1`, the current value of `i` remains 0, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. In this case, `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter) + 1`.***
