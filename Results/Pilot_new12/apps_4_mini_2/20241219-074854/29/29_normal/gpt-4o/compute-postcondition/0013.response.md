Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `files` must contain at least 2 tuples. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` has `name` appended, where `name` is the first part of the second tuple in `files`. Otherwise, `regulars` includes `name`, where `name` is derived from the first part of `file` in `files`, and `type_` represents the second part of `file`.***
