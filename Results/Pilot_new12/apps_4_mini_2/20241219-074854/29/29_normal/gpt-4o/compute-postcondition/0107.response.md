The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and since `temp_counter` was initially 1, it will now be equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, and `temp_counter` is now 2. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is 2, and `str(1)` must be in `files_set`.**
