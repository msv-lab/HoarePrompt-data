Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 3 and can be at most `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`. If the loop did not execute, then `temp_counter` would remain equal to its initial value.**
