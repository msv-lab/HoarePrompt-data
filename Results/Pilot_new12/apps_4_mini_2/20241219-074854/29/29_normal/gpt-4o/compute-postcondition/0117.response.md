Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, and `regulars` contains at least 1 element. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` is updated to the string representation of `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}' and 'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {target}'. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
