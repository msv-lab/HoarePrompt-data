Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`. The current value of `regulars[0]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 4 and at most `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[0]` is set to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` has a new entry formatted as `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`.***
