`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. It was previously greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, so after incrementing, it will now be greater than its previous value and still less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is now greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n` plus 1, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must still be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is now greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
