The code appends a string formatted as 'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}' to the `moves` list. Here, `i` is `2`, so `examples[i]` refers to `examples[2]`, and `i + 1` evaluates to `3`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `examples`, we can represent `examples[2]` with a variable placeholder. 

After running the code, `moves` will include an entry formatted as 'move {examples[2]} 3'. The value of `examples[2]` remains unchanged in this operation, and the initial values of other variables stay the same.

Therefore, the Output State reflecting the changes is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` now includes 'move {examples[2]} 3' and `examples[2]` is still unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` includes 'move {examples[2]} 3', and `examples[2]` remains unchanged.**
