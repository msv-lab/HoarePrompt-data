The variable `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was stated that `temp_counter` is currently less than `2 * n`, it will now be equal to `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `files`, `regulars`, `i`, `target`, `files_set`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 and remains less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and less than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**.
