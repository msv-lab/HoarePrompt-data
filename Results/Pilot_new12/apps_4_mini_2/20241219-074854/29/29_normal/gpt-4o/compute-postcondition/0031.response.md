`moves` is updated to include a new string formatted as `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`. The value of `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, meaning that the conditions for adding to `moves` are satisfied. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` must have at least 1 name, `moves` now includes the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1.**
