Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, and `regulars` contains at least 1 element. If `regulars[i]` does not equal `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', while `regulars[i]` is updated to the string representation of `2 * n + 1`.***
