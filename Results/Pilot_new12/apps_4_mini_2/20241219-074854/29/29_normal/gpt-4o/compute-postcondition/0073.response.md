The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions specify that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, so after the operation, `temp_counter` will remain within this limit. There are no other variables affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to 2 * n, and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set.**
