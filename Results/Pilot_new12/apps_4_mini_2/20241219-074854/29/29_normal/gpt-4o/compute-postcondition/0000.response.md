The variable `examples` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` (which is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000) and `files` (a list of tuples) remains unchanged because the code does not alter them. Therefore, the output state reflects that `examples` is now initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples, `examples` is an empty list**
