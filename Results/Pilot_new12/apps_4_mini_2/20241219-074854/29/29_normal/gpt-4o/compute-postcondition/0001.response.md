The variable `regulars` is initialized as an empty list, which means it will hold no values initially. The previous states of `n`, `files`, and `examples` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list of tuples, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list**.
