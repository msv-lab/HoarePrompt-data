The value of `temp_counter` increases by 1. Since it was previously greater than `2 * n`, it remains greater than `2 * n` after the increment. Also, the other variables remain unchanged through this operation, and `temp_counter` now has a value greater than `2 * n + 1`. The output will reflect the updated value of `temp_counter` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, moves now includes an entry formatted as 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}', and `examples[2]` is now `str(temp_counter)`.**
