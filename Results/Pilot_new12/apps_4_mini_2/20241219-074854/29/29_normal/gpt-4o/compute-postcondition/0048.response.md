Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter - 1)` was found in `files_set`; `n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list containing `n` tuples; `i` is 1; `moves` now contains an additional string in the format 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'; `examples[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`; `temp_counter` is now greater than `2 * n` and has been incremented by 1.**
