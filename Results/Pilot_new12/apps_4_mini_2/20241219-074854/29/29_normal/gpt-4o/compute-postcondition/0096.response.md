The assignment `regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)` assigns the string representation of `temp_counter` to the `i`th index of the `regulars` list. Given that `temp_counter` is guaranteed to be between 1 and `2 * n + 1` (inclusive), and that `str(temp_counter)` is not already in `files_set`, the state of the `regulars` list will change at index `i`. 

Other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Since `regulars` has at least one element and `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `i` refers to an index that is currently out of bounds for the list (as it will be equal to its length), which may lead to an error in a real execution context, but since we are simulating and not executing, we will consider the assignment completes successfully for the given context.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list containing `n` tuples; `regulars` contains at least 1 element; `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, and `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1; `moves` contains `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
