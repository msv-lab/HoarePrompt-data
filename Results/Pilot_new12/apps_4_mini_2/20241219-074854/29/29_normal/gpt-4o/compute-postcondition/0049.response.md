Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 2 names, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` contains an additional string in the format 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'.***
