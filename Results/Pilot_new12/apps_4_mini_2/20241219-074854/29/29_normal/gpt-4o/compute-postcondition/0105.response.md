The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `temp_counter` was previously 0, so the new value of `temp_counter` becomes 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is 1, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is 1, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
