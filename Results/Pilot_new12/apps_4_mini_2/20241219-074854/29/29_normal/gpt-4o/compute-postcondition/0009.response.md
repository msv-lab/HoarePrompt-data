According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `files` variable. If the `files` variable contains at least one more tuple than what has already been processed, the loop will execute again for that next tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `files` must have had at least one tuple, and since the loop processes one tuple at a time, the next tuple must be available.

Since the previous iteration processed the first tuple, for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `files` must have at least 2 tuples, allowing for the first one to have been processed and a second one to be available for processing.
2. The loop will set `file` to the second tuple now at the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must have at least 2 tuples where `file` is the second tuple; `name` is the first part of `file`, and `type_` is the second part of `file`.**
