The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since initially `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, after the addition, `temp_counter` continues to be greater than `2 * n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 1 name, `moves` now includes the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`, `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is str(temp_counter) + 1.**
