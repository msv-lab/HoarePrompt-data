`examples` is updated by appending `name`, which is derived from the first part of the split result from `file`. The initial state mentions that `files` must contain at least 2 tuples, meaning `file` has valid values. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must contain at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the split result from `file`, and `examples` now includes `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must contain at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the split result from `file`, `examples` includes `name`.**
