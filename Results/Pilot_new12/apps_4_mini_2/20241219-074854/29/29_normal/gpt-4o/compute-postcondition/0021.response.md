The variable `temp_counter` is assigned the value of `n + 1`, which increases `temp_counter` by 1 compared to the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `temp_counter` will range from 2 to 100,001. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is '1', `regulars` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`.**
