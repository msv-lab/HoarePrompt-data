The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` must remain less than or equal to `2 * n`, the value of `temp_counter` will become one greater than its previous value, retaining that condition. The states of the other variables: `n`, `files`, `i`, and `files_set` remain unaffected. The output state includes that `temp_counter` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is now greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.**
