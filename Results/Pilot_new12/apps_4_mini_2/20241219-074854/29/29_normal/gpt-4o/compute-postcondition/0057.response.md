The variable `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Its previous value is less than `2 * n`, and since `temp_counter` must also be in the expected state, we can conclude that `temp_counter` now must be less than `2 * n` plus `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is now less than `2 * n + 1` and must have increased by 1, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is still in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n + 1`.**
