The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, meaning `temp_counter` will now be 1 greater than its previous value. Since it was already stated that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` will still comply with this condition as long as the original value was not already equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` has been increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `2 * n**.
