According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `examples` list. Since the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `len(examples) - 1`, for it to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(examples)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently `0` and `examples` has at least 1 name, indicating that the length of `examples` is at least 1.

To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `1`, so `i` will be `1`. This means `examples` must have at least `2` names for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 2 names, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`**
