In the provided code snippet, the variable `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` must be `<= 2 * n - 1`, which means that after this increment, `temp_counter` will now be `<= 2 * n`. Other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state updates only `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must now be `<= 2 * n`.**
