The variable `regulars[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. The value of `temp_counter` is given as `2 * n + 1`, so `regulars[i]` becomes `str(2 * n + 1)`. Other variables, such as `files_set` and `moves`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`, `moves` now includes the string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`, and `regulars[i]` is the string representation of `2 * n + 1`.**
