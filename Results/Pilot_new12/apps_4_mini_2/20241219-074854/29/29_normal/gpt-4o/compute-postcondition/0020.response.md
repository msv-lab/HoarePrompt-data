The code initializes an empty list `moves`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified, and the lists `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` also remain unchanged because the operation only affects `moves`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `moves` has been initialized as an empty list while keeping the states of the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is '1', `regulars` is a list of names from `files` where the corresponding type is not '1', `moves` is an empty list.**
