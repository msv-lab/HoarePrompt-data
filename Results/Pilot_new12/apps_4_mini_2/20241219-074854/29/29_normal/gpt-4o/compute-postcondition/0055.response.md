The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. It was previously known that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output reflects the updated value of `temp_counter`, which is now `temp_counter + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1.**
