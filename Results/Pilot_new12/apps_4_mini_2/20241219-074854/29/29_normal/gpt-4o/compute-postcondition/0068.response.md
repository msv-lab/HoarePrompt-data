Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, in `examples` each name corresponds to its index in the list (i.e., `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)` for all `i` in the range of the length of `examples`). `moves` contains strings in the format 'move {original_example} {target}', where `original_example` is the name from `examples` that was not equal to its index + 1 at any point, and `target` is the final value of `temp_counter` which is greater than or equal to `n + 1` if the loop executed. `temp_counter` is equal to the greatest incremented value encountered during the execution of the loop or remains `n + 1` if it never enters the while loop.**
