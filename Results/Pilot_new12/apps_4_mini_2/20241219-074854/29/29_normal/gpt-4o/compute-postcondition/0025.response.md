The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, so after the increment, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` must have at least 1 name, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 2`, `i` is 0, `current value of examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1, and str(n + 1) must be in files_set**
