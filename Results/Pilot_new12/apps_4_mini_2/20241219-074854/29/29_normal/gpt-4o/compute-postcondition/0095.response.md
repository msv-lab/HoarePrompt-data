The code appends a string to the `moves` list, formatted as `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

The value of `regulars[i]` implies that `i` is still equal to `len(regulars)`, which means `regulars[i]` is not a valid index since `i` is out of the bounds of the list. Therefore, an exception would normally occur in actual code, but since we are simulating the execution, we will treat this as if it has been appended successfully as per the instruction.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list containing `n` tuples; `regulars` contains at least 1 element; `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1; `moves` contains `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
