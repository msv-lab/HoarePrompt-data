The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it is initially specified that `temp_counter` must be less than `2 * n`, after incrementing, `temp_counter` will still satisfy this condition. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must still be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must still be in `files_set**.
