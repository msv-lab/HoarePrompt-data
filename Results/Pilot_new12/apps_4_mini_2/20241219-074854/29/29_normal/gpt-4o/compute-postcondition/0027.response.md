The variable `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and that `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`. The values of `n` and `files_set` are not affected by the increment operation on `temp_counter`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `temp_counter`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1**.
