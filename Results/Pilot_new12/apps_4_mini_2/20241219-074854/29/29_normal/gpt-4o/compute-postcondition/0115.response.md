Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, and `regulars` contains at least 1 element. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`. `temp_counter` is set to `2 * n + 2`, `files_set` contains string representations of all integers from 1 to `2 * n`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'. Additionally, `regulars[i]` has been updated to the string representation of `2 * n + 1`.***
