Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 3 names, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. The string representation of `examples[2]` is not equal to '3', so `moves` will include an entry formatted as 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}', and `examples[2]` will be updated to `str(temp_counter)` while retaining all other precondition values.***
