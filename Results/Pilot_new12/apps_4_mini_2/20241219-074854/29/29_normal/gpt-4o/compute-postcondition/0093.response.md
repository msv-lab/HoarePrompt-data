The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. It was previously required to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and since `temp_counter` must remain within that range post-increment, `temp_counter` can take on a new value of `temp_counter + 1`. The values of `n`, `files`, `regulars`, `i`, `target`, and `files_set` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, `temp_counter` is `<= 2 * n` after being incremented by 1, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
