The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Its previous value was at least 3, and since it can be at most `2 * n`, after the increment, `temp_counter` will still remain greater than or equal to 4. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 4 and can be at most `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list containing `n` tuples; `regulars[0]` is `str(temp_counter)`; `i` is 0; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1; `moves` has a new entry formatted as `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 4 and can be at most `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list containing `n` tuples; `regulars[0]` is `str(temp_counter)`; `i` is 0; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1; `moves` has a new entry formatted as `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`.**
