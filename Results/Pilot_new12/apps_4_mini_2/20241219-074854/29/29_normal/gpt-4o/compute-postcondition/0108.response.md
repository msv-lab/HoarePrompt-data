According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are observed:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `temp_counter` is 2.
- `str(1)` is in `files_set`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. Since `temp_counter` is currently 2, in order for the loop to continue for one more iteration, `temp_counter` must be incremented to at least 3.
2. Given `temp_counter` will be 3 in the next iteration, `str(temp_counter)`, which will be "3," must also be present in `files_set` for the loop to execute again.
3. Since `temp_counter` must remain less than or equal to `2 * n`, and we know `n` is a positive integer, it must hold true that `n` is at least 2 for `temp_counter` to reach or maintain this condition.

Thus, we need to state that `files_set` must contain "3" to proceed to the next iteration, and `n` must be adjusted accordingly if `n` were to be defined more loosely.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files_set` must contain "3", and `temp_counter` must be equal to 3**
