The `name` and `type_` variables are assigned the values from splitting the `file` tuple on whitespace. The initial conditions specify that `files` contains at least 2 tuples, and `file` is assumed to be the second tuple provided in `files`. 

Let's denote the second tuple from `files` as `file`. The split operation will separate `file` into two parts: the first part will be assigned to `name` and the second part will be assigned to `type_`. We do not have the specific contents of the tuples in `files`, thus we'll denote the values as `name` becomes the first element of `file` and `type_` becomes the second element of `file`.

The initial state remains valid, only the values of `name` and `type_` change. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must have at least 2 tuples where `file` is the second tuple; `name` is the first part of `file`, and `type_` is the second part of `file`. `name` is the first part of `file` and `type_` is the second part of `file`.**
