The variable `name` is assigned the first part of the split result from `file`, which is itself a second tuple from the list `files`. The code appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. As `regulars` will now contain an additional element, representing the value of `name`, the state of other variables will remain the same.

Since `name` corresponds to the first part of the split result from `file`, the new state will reflect that the `regulars` list now includes this `name`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must contain at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the split result from `file`, `type_` is the second part of the split result from `file`, `regulars` now includes `name`.**
