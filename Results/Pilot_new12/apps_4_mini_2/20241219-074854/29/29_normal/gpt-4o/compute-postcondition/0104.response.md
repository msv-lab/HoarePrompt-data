To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let’s analyze the conditions present in the `while` loop:

1. The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
2. From the provided state:
   - `n` is a positive integer, which implies that `2 * n` is also positive.
   - `files` is a list containing `n` tuples.
   - `files_set` will be a set derived from the elements in `files`, thus it is non-empty since `files` contains `n` tuples.
   - `regulars` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`.
   - `target` equals `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1`, which seems unrelated to the loop condition.

To execute the loop:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. 
- Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Since we have no explicit value for `temp_counter`, it could be any number, but we must ensure it meets the conditions. Here’s how to assure that:

1. We need to adjust `temp_counter` to ensure it's less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `n` is positive, if `temp_counter` is set to be any non-negative integer (specifically `0` in this case), the first condition will be satisfied.
   
2. We also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` appears in `files_set`. Since `files` contains `n` tuples, we should check if the tuples can be represented as strings and include them in the `files_set`. 

Thus, if the existing value of `temp_counter` is such that `str(temp_counter)` isn't currently in `files_set`, we need to adjust either the value of `temp_counter` or ensure that `files_set` contains the desired string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1, temp_counter is 0, str(temp_counter) is in files_set**
