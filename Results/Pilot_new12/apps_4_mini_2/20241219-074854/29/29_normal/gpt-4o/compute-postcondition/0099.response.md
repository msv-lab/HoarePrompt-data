Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`. `temp_counter` is a value greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[i]` has been updated to `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` contains `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`. No changes occur since there is no else part.***
