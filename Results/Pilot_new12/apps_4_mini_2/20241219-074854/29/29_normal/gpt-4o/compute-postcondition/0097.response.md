The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, after the increment, `temp_counter` will still lie within this range. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `2` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `n` is a positive integer; `files` is a list containing `n` tuples; `regulars` contains at least 1 element; `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`; `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regulars) + 1; `moves` contains `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
