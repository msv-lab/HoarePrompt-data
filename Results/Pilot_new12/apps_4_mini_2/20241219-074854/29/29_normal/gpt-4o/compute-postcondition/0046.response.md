The code appends a formatted string to the list `moves`. The formatted string includes the current value of `temp_counter` and the example at index `i` from the `examples` list. 

1. The `examples[i]` is accessed using the value of `i`, which is currently `1`.
2. `moves` is modified by appending `f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`, which constructs a string using the specified values.

The other variables in the initial state are not modified, and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter - 1)` was found in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1, and `moves` now contains an additional string in the format 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'.**
