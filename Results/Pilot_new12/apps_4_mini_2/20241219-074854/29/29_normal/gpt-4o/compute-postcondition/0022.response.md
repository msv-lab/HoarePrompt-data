According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `examples` list. The loop will execute as long as `examples` contains at least one element. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), it ensures that there are `n` tuples in `files`, although it does not directly ensure that `examples` has at least one name.

The state before the loop shows that `examples` is derived from `files` based on a condition (`files` where the corresponding type is '1'). The first iteration of the loop would mean that `i` starts at 0 and `examples` must not be empty at this point.

For the loop to be executed:
- `examples` must contain at least 1 name.
- `i` will start at 0 representing the first index of `examples`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` must have at least 1 name, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1, `i` is 0**
