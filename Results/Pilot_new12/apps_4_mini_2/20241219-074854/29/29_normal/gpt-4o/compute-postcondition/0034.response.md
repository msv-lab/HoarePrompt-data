Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 1 name, `moves` now includes the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)` and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. In this case, `i` remains 0 and `examples[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter) + 1`.***
