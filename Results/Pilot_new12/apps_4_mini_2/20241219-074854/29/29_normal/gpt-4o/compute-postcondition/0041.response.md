According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop can execute again if both conditions are satisfied:

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `temp_counter` is greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time:

- Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`, no adjustment is needed here as the current state satisfies this condition.
- However, for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is such that `str(temp_counter + 1)` still exists in `files_set`. To make sure the loop can run again, we need `str(temp_counter + 1)` to be in `files_set`.

Thus, the required change is that `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is now greater than its previous value but still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**.
