Let's analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state:

1. The variable `moves` is a list that will get a new string appended to it.
2. The new string is formatted as `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`.
3. Since `i` is 0, `examples[i]` refers to `examples[0]`, which has the value of `str(temp_counter) + 1`.
4. The value of `i + 1` is `1`, so the formatted string becomes `f'move {str(temp_counter) + 1} 1'`.

Given the above information, we will update the `moves` list by appending the above string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 1 name, `moves` now includes the string `move {str(temp_counter) + 1} 1`, the current value of `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.**
