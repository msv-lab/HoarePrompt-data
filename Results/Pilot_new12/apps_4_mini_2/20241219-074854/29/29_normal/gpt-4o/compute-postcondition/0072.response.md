To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the `while` loop condition.

The loop can execute if:
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`
- `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`

Now, let's break down the program state given:

1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, which implies `files_set` should contain at least `n` elements such that the items can be represented as strings.
3. `regulars` must have at least 1 element, but the current value of `regulars[i]` (which means the first element of `regulars`) is not equal to the string representation of `target`.

From the loop condition, we'll need to ensure:
- `temp_counter` has a value that is within the bounds (`<= 2 * n`).
- Additionally, we need `str(temp_counter)` to be an element of `files_set`.

Since we have no information about `temp_counter` in the provided state, we can conclude:
- We need `temp_counter` to be defined such that it satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
- We also need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

Given that we don't know the actual value of `temp_counter`, to ensure the loop runs at least once, we will assume the following states as necessary adjustments:
1. Define `temp_counter` such that it is an integer satisfying the condition.
2. Confirm that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, we could express:
- If `temp_counter` starts out greater than `2 * n`, it needs to be adjusted to be `<= 2 * n`.
- The `files_set` should include the string representation of the adjusted `temp_counter`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + 1, temp_counter must be less than or equal to 2 * n and str(temp_counter) must be in files_set**
