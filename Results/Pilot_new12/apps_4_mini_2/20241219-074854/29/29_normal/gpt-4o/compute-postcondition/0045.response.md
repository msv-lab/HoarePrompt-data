Given the conditions provided for the loop and the associated states after a few iterations, we can analyze the final output state after the loop has executed as follows:

- The loop continues while `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and while `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `temp_counter` by 1.
- Initially, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, hence the loop does not execute if `temp_counter` starts out greater than `2 * n`.
  
Considering the necessary conditions for the loop to have executed any number of times, letâ€™s outline the output state after all iterations:

1. If `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, the loop would have executed.
2. After the last iteration, `temp_counter` will exceed `2 * n` because the loop terminates when either condition fails.
3. Hence, after all iterations, `temp_counter` would be greater than `2 * n`.
4. At the final state, since the loop continues until `str(temp_counter)` is no longer found in `files_set`, this means before terminating, `str(temp_counter - 1)` was the last string that was present in `files_set`.

Therefore, combining all these observations:

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter - 1)` was found in `files_set`, and `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 1.**
