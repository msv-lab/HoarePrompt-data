The code splits the second tuple in `files` using the default whitespace delimiter and assigns the resultant values to the variables `name` and `type_`. The variable `file` contains a tuple, which must be a string representation of two elements since tuples can store multiple elements. Therefore, `file.split()` will result in two values being extracted from the second tuple.

As a result, after executing the code, the variable `name` will contain the first part of the split string, and `type_` will contain the second part. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and `files` continues to contain at least 2 tuples. The specific values of `name` and `type_` depend on the contents of the second tuple in `files`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must contain at least 2 tuples, `file` is the second tuple in `files`, `name` is the first part of the split result from `file`, `type_` is the second part of the split result from `file`.**
