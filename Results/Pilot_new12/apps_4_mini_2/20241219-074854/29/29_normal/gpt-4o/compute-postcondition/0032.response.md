The variable `examples[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` will also be a string greater than the string representations of any integers less than or equal to `2 * n`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` has at least 1 name, `moves` now includes the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`, `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is str(temp_counter)**.
