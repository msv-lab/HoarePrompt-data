According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on two conditions: `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`. 

Let's break down the conditions based on the provided state right before the loop:
- `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`, which means it will always be less than or equal to `2 * n`, because `n + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` for positive integers.
- The value of `temp_counter`, which is `n + 1`, needs to be in `files_set` in string form (`str(temp_counter)`), hence `str(n + 1)` needs to be present in `files_set` for the loop to execute.

Since we don't have specific details about `files_set`, we can assume that the loop can proceed for the first time if this condition is met.

State modifications required:
- Ensure `str(n + 1)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `examples` must have at least 1 name, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `current value of examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1, and str(n + 1) must be in files_set**.
