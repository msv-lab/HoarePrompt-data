The value of `name`, which is the first part of the first tuple in the `files` list, is appended to the `regulars` list. The conditions regarding `n`, `files`, and `type_` remain valid after execution. The only variable affected is `regulars`, which now includes the value of `name`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `files` must have at least 1 tuple, `file` is the first tuple in the `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`, and `type_` is not equal to '1'; `regulars` now includes `name`.**
