Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples, `regulars` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to `len(regulars)`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter)` where `temp_counter` is a value greater than or equal to `2` and less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `moves` contains `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`. If `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(target)`, no changes occur.***
