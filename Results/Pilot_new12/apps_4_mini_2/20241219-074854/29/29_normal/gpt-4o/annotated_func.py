    return moves
    #The program returns the list 'moves' reflecting all necessary transitions based on the updates made during loop execution, pertaining to the structure of 'files' containing 'n' tuples and 'regulars' containing string representations of integers from its original state to '2 * n + 1'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of file tuples, each containing a filename and a type indicator (either a regular test or an example test). It separates these files into two lists: `examples` for example tests indicated by type '1', and `regulars` for regular tests indicated by type '0'. The function then adjusts the filenames in both lists according to specific conditions, ensuring that the names correspond to their index positions. If the example filenames do not match the expected numerical naming (based on their index), the function generates a series of 'move' commands that indicate the necessary changes to maintain the desired naming convention. The same process is applied to the regular filenames, with the target names determined based on their respective order. After processing all files, it returns a list of these move commands, reflecting the necessary transitions made to ensure that the filenames correspond correctly to their expected values. Additionally, the function handles situations where target names may already exist, by incrementing a temporary counter up to double the integer `n` to find a suitable target, thereby preventing name collisions.
