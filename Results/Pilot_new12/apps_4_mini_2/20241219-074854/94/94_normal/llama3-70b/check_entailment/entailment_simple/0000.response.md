Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration based solely on the conditions provided in the problem description.

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Flawed Tile Movement Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to swap the 'X' positions in both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` to compare their contents. However, swapping does not accurately represent the operation of sliding a tile into the empty position. The program does not simulate the actual moves allowed by sliding tiles. 

2. **Invalid Comparison of Puzzle States**:
   - After the swap, the program only checks if the sorted versions of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are equal. This approach fails because two puzzles can have the same tiles, but different configurations due to the order of tiles and the empty position. The sorting does not reflect the possibility of moving tiles to check for a valid sequence of moves.

3. **Failure to Account for Movement Rules**:
   - The puzzle's actual solvability requires examining the specific legal movements allowed by the position of 'X' and adjacent tiles. The program lacks logic to explore or simulate valid sequences of tile moves that could lead one puzzle to reach the configuration of the other, which is essential for determining whether two puzzles can become identical.

As a result, the program only checks for tile consistency (through sorting) rather than exploring the full space of possible configurations attainable through valid sliding moves, which goes against the fundamental requirement set out in the problem description.
