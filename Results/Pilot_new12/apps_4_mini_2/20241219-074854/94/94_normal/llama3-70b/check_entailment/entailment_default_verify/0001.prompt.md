You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
    (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to carefully analyze both the logic implemented in the code and the rules governing the 2x2 sliding puzzles.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input grid for two puzzles, each consisting of a 2x2 grid with tiles 'A', 'B', 'C', and an empty cell 'X'. It concatenates the input into strings representing the state of each puzzle.

2. **Finding 'X' Positions**: The function `func_1` identifies the positions of 'X' in both puzzle strings.

3. **Swapping Tiles**: The code attempts to swap the positions of the tiles corresponding to the empty cells ('X') of each puzzle, however, this logic is flawed. The line:
   ```python
   (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
   ```
   simply tries to "swap" the tiles represented by positions `x1` and `x2`, which is nonsensical in the context of the sliding puzzle as it does not take into account if these swaps are permitted based on adjacency rules defined by the puzzle mechanics.

4. **Comparing Configurations**: After attempting the invalid swap, it compares the sorted versions of both puzzles. However, this approach does not accurately track the legitimate moves that can bring one puzzle to be the same as the other.

### Counterexample

To demonstrate a failure case:
- Consider the following two configurations:

**Puzzle 1 Configuration:**
```
A B
X C
```

**Puzzle 2 Configuration:**
```
C B
A X
```

The expected output is "NO" since there is no sequence of legal moves that can transform Puzzle 1 into Puzzle 2. 

However, running the provided program may falsely assess this situation as a match due to the incorrect tile swapping and sorting logic.

### Conclusion

Given the flawed logic for solving the tile movements and comparisons between the two puzzles, the program does not appropriately determine if the two puzzles can become identical through valid moves.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two 2D lists `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing two strings with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', where 'X' represents a variable position that can change. It identifies the index of 'X' in both puzzles and swaps the characters at those indices. After the swap, it checks if the characters in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other by sorting and comparing them. The function returns True if they are permutations and False otherwise. However, it is important to note that the code assumes the input format strictly (two strings per puzzle, each with the correct characters), which may lead to errors if this condition is not met, as there is no error handling or validation for the input format.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
