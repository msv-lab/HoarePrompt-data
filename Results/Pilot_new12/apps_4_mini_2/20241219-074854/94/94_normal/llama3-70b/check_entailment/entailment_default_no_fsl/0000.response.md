Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The fundamental issue arises in the way it handles the check for possible configurations.

1. The function `func_1` only swaps the 'X' positions in the two puzzles and checks if the resulting strings are permutations of each other. This is not sufficient because the problem allows for tiles to slide into the empty space ('X'), and simply checking for permutations doesn't factor in the adjacency required to actually make these moves.

2. Specifically, configurations like the following demonstrate the flaw:
   - Bessie's puzzle:  
     ```
     A B
     X C
     ```
   - Elsie's puzzle:  
     ```
     B A
     C X
     ```
   - The expected output is “YES” because Bessie can slide 'B' down into 'X', and Elsie can slide 'C' up into 'X'. However, the current implementation would incorrectly identify these puzzles as configurations that cannot reach the same state since it would check them as permutations instead of considering the tile movement rules.

Thus, the logic fails to encapsulate the movement rules of the sliding puzzle, yielding incorrect results.
