#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are 2D lists containing two strings each, where each string has exactly two characters, and each puzzle contains the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True or False based on whether `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the same characters after sorting, confirming that they are permutations of each other.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two 2D lists `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing two strings with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', where 'X' represents a variable position that can change. It identifies the index of 'X' in both puzzles and swaps the characters at those indices. After the swap, it checks if the characters in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other by sorting and comparing them. The function returns True if they are permutations and False otherwise. However, it is important to note that the code assumes the input format strictly (two strings per puzzle, each with the correct characters), which may lead to errors if this condition is not met, as there is no error handling or validation for the input format.
