Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two 2D lists `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each containing two strings with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', where 'X' represents a variable position that can change. It identifies the index of 'X' in both puzzles and swaps the characters at those indices. After the swap, it checks if the characters in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are permutations of each other by sorting and comparing them. The function returns True if they are permutations and False otherwise. However, it is important to note that the code assumes the input format strictly (two strings per puzzle, each with the correct characters), which may lead to errors if this condition is not met, as there is no error handling or validation for the input format.**
