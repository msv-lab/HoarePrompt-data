The statement swaps the characters at specific indices in the two puzzles. The initial state indicates that `x1` and `x2` are the indices of 'X' in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` respectively. After executing the swap operation, the character that was at the index `x1` in `puzzle1` (which is 'X') will move to the index `x2` in `puzzle2`, and vice versa for `puzzle1`.

Thus, the final values result in 'X' being in both puzzles at their corresponding new indices.

Output State: **`x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`, `puzzle2[x2]` is 'X', `puzzle1[x1]` is the character that was originally in `puzzle2[x2]`, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the characters 'A', 'B', 'C' (and 'X' exactly once, swapped between them).**
