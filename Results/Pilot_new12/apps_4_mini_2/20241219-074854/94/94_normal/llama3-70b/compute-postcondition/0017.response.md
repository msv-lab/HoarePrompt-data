Initial State: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing strings with characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; each character appears exactly once in each puzzle. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to 0, `x1` is 0 if `puzzle1[0]` is 'X', `x2` is 0 if `puzzle2[0]` is 'X'.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 1, `x1` remains unchanged from 0 if `puzzle1[1]` is not 'X', `x2` is 1 if `puzzle2[1]` is 'X', otherwise it remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 2, `x1` is 2 if `puzzle1[2]` is 'X', otherwise it remains unchanged, `x2` is 2 if `puzzle2[2]` is 'X', otherwise it remains unchanged.

Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `i` is 3, `x1` is 3 if `puzzle1[3]` is 'X', otherwise it retains the last value, `x2` is 3 if `puzzle2[3]` is 'X', otherwise it retains the last value. Both `x1` and `x2` are the indices of 'X' in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` respectively.

Final Output State: **`x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once.**
