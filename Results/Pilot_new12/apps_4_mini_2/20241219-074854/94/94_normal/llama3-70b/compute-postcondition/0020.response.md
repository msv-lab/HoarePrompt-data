The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing two strings each. Each string consists of exactly two characters, and within each puzzle, the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' are present exactly once. After processing the input, the function returns `True` if `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the same characters after sorting, meaning they are permutations of each other; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two 2D lists and determine whether they contain the same characters in a different order.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, puzzle1 and puzzle2, which are 2D lists of strings. It returns True if the sorted characters of both puzzles are the same (indicating they are permutations of each other); otherwise, it returns False.**
