The function accepts a string parameter `start`, which represents the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle. It performs a breadth-first search to explore all unique configurations of the puzzle that can be reached by valid moves of the empty space ('X'). The function constructs a set `visited` that contains all configurations encountered during the traversal. After executing, the function returns `visited`, which represents all unique states of the puzzle starting from the initial configuration and includes configurations reachable by making legal moves. Note that the function assumes the input string is correctly formatted as a length-4 string with the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. Missing functionality includes handling invalid inputs or assumptions about the input formatâ€”which could lead to potential errors when calling methods like `index` on improperly formatted strings.
