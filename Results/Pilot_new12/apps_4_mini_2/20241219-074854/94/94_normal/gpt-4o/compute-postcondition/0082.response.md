The code assigns new values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the calculation involving `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the values of `dr` and `dc`. The values of `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged since they were calculated from `current` before the operation, and the values of `dr` and `dc` (which are presumably part of `directions`) are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` must contain at least 1 element.**
