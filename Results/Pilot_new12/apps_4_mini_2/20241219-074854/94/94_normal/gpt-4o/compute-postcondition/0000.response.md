In the provided code, `queue` is initialized as a deque (double-ended queue) containing the variable `start`, which is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty space ('X'). The variable `start` holds the specific configuration of the sliding puzzle. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged since this line of code only affects `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty space ('X'); `queue` is a deque containing `start`.**
