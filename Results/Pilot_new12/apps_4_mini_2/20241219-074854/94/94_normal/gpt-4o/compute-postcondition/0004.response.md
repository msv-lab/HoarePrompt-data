The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and retrieves the leftmost element from `queue`. Initially, `queue` contains the string `start`. Since `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty space ('X'), `queue` will initially have a single element, which is equivalent to `start`. 

After the operation, `queue` will be empty, and `current` will be assigned the value of `start`. The other variables, `visited` and `directions`, remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `current` has taken on the value of `start`, which is a string containing 'ABCX', and that `queue` is now empty.

Output State: **`start` is a string 'ABCX'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing 'ABCX'; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'**.
