To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the loop condition, which is `while queue:`. The loop will continue as long as `queue` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we see:

- `start` is 'ABCX'.
- `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' obtained by moving the empty space.
- `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution.
- `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is 'ABCX'.
- `empty_pos` is 3.
- `empty_row` is 1.
- `empty_col` is 1.

Since the loop runs while `queue` is non-empty and the provided information does not imply that `queue` is empty at the end of the last iteration, we can conclude that the loop can execute again without needing to adjust any states.

Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' obtained by moving the empty space, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1.**
