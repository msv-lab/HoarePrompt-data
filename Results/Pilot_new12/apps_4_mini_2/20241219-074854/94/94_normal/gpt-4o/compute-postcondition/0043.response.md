The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` calculates the row and column indices from the `empty_pos` variable by using the `divmod` function. This function divides `empty_pos` by 2, and it returns a tuple where the first element is the quotient (representing the row index) and the second element is the remainder (representing the column index).

Initially, `empty_pos` represents the index of 'X' in the configuration and it can be any integer.

After executing the code, the following updates occur:

- `empty_row` is assigned the value of the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col` is assigned the value of the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.

The values of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, and `directions` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State with the updated values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` is as follows:

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the next configuration from `queue`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
