The code assigns `new_state_str` the value of the joined string created from `new_state`. The variable `new_state` contains the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, but the exact characters in `new_state` are not specified in the initial conditions. Since the output state will reflect the new string representation created from `new_state`, without changing other variables, we note that `new_state_str` now holds this new value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is unchanged; `new_state_str` is the string representation created from `new_state`.**
