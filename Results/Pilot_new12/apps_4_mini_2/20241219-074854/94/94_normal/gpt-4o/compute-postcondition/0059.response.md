The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of the list made from the current variable `current`. The previous values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `visited`, `queue`, and `current` are not materially affected by this operation. However, the new representation of `current` as a list is part of the state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `visited` remains unchanged; `queue` remains unchanged; `current` remains unchanged; `new_state` is a list containing the elements of `current`.**
