According to the code, the loop iterates over the `directions`, which are defined as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. This means there are four possible directions that will be processed in each iteration of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `current` is 'ABCX'
- `empty_pos` is 3
- `empty_row` is 1
- `empty_col` is 1

The loop body will execute four times, once for each direction. If we are currently at the last direction (1, 0) for the next iteration, we need to move to the next index in the `directions` list. 

Since the loop is enumerating through `directions`, and the current state processes elements as follows:
1. (-1, 0) to move up
2. (1, 0) to move down
3. (0, -1) to move left
4. (0, 1) to move right

If we are on the last direction iteration (the 4th direction, (0, 1)), after this iteration, we will proceed to the next loop iteration, which means we need to reset or iterate back to the first direction:

The next iteration's conditions for the first execution would be:
- The loop will continue and will now refer to the first direction (-1, 0) again.

Thus, to summarize, the necessary adjustments in state at the start of the next iteration are:
- `directions` remains the same.
- `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` would represent the initial state again for re-evaluation.

State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains 'ABXC' if 'ABXC' was not previously in `visited`, `visited` includes both 'ABCX' and 'ABXC', `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, and the index for directions is reset to 0 (first direction will be used).**
