Output State: **`visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that can be achieved through valid moves, `queue` contains all configurations yet to be processed, `current` is the last leftmost configuration processed in `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains the possible movement directions for 'X'. If there are no more valid moves, the loop will terminate and no further updates will occur to `visited` or `queue`.**
