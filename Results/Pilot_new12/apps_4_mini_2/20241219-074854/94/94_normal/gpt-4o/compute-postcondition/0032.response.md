`new_state` is assigned the value of a list created from `current` (which is 'ABCX'). Therefore, `new_state` will now be a list containing the characters of the string 'ABCX', which are `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'ABXC' and 'AXCB'; `visited` includes 'ABCX', 'ABXC', and 'AXCB'; `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `3 + 2 * dr + dc`; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'AXCB'; `new_row` is 1 + `dr`; `new_col` is 1 + `dc'**
