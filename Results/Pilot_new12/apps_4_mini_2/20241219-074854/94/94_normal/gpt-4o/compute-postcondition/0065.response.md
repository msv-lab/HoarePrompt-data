Postcondition: ***`new_row`, `new_col` are based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. If `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive and `new_col` is between 0 and 1 inclusive, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `new_state_str` and `queue` also includes `new_state_str`, while `current` remains unchanged. If the condition is not satisfied, `visited`, `queue`, and `current` remain unchanged.***
