The code concatenates the elements of `new_state` into a single string, assigning the result to `new_state_str`. The values of the variables that have changed in the program are:
- `new_state_str` now holds the string representation of the list `new_state`.

Since the previous state remains unchanged except for the new value of `new_state_str`, the output state reflects the current values.

Output State: **`new_state` is updated with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`**.
