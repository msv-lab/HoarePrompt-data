The code appends the value of `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `new_state_str` is now included in `queue`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element and now also includes `new_state_str`, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution plus `new_state_str`, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is unchanged.**
