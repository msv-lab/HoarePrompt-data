Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains 'ABXC', `visited` now includes both 'ABCX' and 'ABXC', `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 4, `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'], and `new_state_str` is 'ABXC' if 'ABXC' was not previously in `visited`.***
