The code performs a division operation that computes the row and column indices of the empty position ('X') based on its index in the two-dimensional structure (which appears to have dimensions of 2 columns). The variables `empty_row` and `empty_col` will be updated based on the value of `empty_pos`.

Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X', which is within a configuration represented as a flat list or string, the division operation will determine which row and column the 'X' occupies. 

Therefore:

- `empty_row` will be the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2.
- `empty_col` will be the remainder of that division (the column index).

The values of the `visited`, `queue`, `current`, and `empty_pos` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that have been generated during the loop's execution, `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, and `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`.**
