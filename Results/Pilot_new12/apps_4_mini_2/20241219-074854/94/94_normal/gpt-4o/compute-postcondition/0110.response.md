The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The previous state of the variables does not change because the append operation is performed on `queue`, and the other variables remain as they were before this line of code. The impact of the code on the output state is that `queue` now contains `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`new_state` is updated with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state` and `new_state_str` is now added to `visited`, `queue` now contains `new_state_str`.**
