The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are derived from `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, respectively. Therefore, `new_pos` will be equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`. The states of the other variables `visited`, `queue`, and `current` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` remains unchanged.**
