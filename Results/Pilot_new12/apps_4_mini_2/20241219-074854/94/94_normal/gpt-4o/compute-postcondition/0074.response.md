Postcondition: ***`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` is the same with `new_state_str` added to it if `new_state_str` was not already visited. `queue` now includes `new_state_str` if it was not already visited, while `current`, `new_pos`, and `new_state_str` remain unchanged.***
