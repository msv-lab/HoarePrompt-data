The code swaps the values in the `new_state` list at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The previous state indicates that `new_state` is a list copied from `current`, and `new_pos` is calculated based on the values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`. 

Since there are no changes to `new_row`, `new_col`, `visited`, and `queue`, we do not modify those variables. However, the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` within `new_state` are affected by the swap operation.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` is unchanged, `new_pos` is equal to `2 * empty_row + 2 * dr + empty_col + dc; `new_state` is modified with a swap at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
