Initial State: `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos` remain unchanged, `dr` and `dc` are the next direction values in the directions list, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1. 

```
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```

Now, please think step by step: 
- `new_row` is assigned the value of `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is assigned the value of `empty_col + dc`.
- The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not provided, but they remain unchanged.
- Other variables `new_pos` remain unchanged, and the updated `current_direction_index` has increased by 1, but its previous value is not known.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains unchanged, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1.**
