The code swaps the values at the positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the list `new_state`. The variable `new_state` is a list copy of `current`, so the other variables are not affected except for the state of `new_state`. The `empty_pos` value remains unchanged but the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.

Given that `new_pos` is calculated as `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, the precise contents of `new_state` depend on the specific values of `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc` at the moment of execution. Additionally, the variable `current_direction_index` is not mentioned to have a specific value, but it's increased by 1.

Output State: **`new_state` is updated with new_state[empty_pos] and new_state[new_pos] swapped, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and `new_state` is a list copy of `current`.**
