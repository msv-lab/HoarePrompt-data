The value of `current` is assigned the configuration obtained by popping the leftmost element from the `queue`. The values of `start`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unaffected by this operation. The previous value of `current` was 'ABCX', and after executing the code, `current` will contain the next configuration from `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the next configuration from `queue`, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1.**
