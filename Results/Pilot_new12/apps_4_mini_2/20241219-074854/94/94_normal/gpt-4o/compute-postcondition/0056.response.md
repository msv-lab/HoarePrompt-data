To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop based on the provided information, let's analyze the situation step by step.

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `new_row` is between 0 and 1, `new_col` is also between 0 and 1, and if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, it was added to both `queue` and `visited`. 

The `directions` list contains the pairs of directions represented by (dr, dc), which are:

- (-1, 0) - Move up
- (1, 0) - Move down
- (0, -1) - Move left
- (0, 1) - Move right

This means that we will iterate over four possible directions â€” up, down, left, and right. 

The loop will continue for each pair (dr, dc) in `directions` until it has gone through all the options. Since `current` remains unchanged, it implies that the identity of the starting position doesn't affect the loop's iterations concerning directions.

Because we are about to iterate through these directions, we can assume that:

1. After completing the current iteration of the loop, we will go through successive pairs in `directions`.
2. For the loop to execute a next iteration for each direction in `directions`, we do not specifically change `visited`, `queue`, or `current`, but we prepare to check each direction represented by (dr, dc).

Given the structure of your parameters, as there are four directions, after this loop iteration, the expected states would be that the next check will occur in these directional values.

For the loop to execute one more time meaning that we still use the same conditions of `new_row` and `new_col` between 0 and 1, we do not need to change those, but we need to iterate over the directions again.

State: **`new_row` is between 0 and 1, `new_col` is between 0 and 1, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` remains unchanged**.
