The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned values based on the expressions `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`. The initial states of `new_row` and `new_col` are not specified in terms of exact values, but they remain between 0 and 1. After executing the code, `new_row` becomes equal to `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` becomes equal to `empty_col + dc`. The values of `visited`, `queue`, and `current` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments to `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` remains unchanged**.
