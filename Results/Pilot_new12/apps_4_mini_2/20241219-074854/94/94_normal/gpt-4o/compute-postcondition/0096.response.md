The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of `list(current)`. This means that `new_state` becomes a copy of `current`, but the values of `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Thus, after executing the code, the output state reflects that `new_state` is a list derived from `current`.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list derived from `current`.**
