Output State: **`visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that have been generated during the loop's execution, `queue` contains all valid configurations that have yet to be processed, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is unchanged since it is the next configuration from `queue`, and if no configurations were valid to generate new states, `visited` and `queue` would remain unchanged from their initial values.**
