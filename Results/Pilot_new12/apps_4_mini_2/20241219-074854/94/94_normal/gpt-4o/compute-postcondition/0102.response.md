Postcondition: ***`new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos` are calculated based on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.***
