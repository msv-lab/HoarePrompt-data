The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates the elements of the list or sequence `new_state` into a single string. The values of `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation. The variable `new_state` remains unchanged in terms of its identity, but the result of the join operation creates a new string representation based on its content. Thus, the output state will retain all previous values while updating `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` remains unchanged, `new_state_str` is a string created by concatenating the elements of `new_state`.**
