The code assigns values to `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the directional changes represented by `dr` and `dc`. The specific values of `new_row` and `new_col` will depend on the current values of `dr` and `dc` being iterated through.

Since `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1, after the loop through each direction:
- For `(-1, 0)`: `new_row = 1 - 1 = 0`, `new_col = 1 + 0 = 1`
- For `(1, 0)`: `new_row = 1 + 1 = 2`, `new_col = 1 + 0 = 1`
- For `(0, -1)`: `new_row = 1 + 0 = 1`, `new_col = 1 - 1 = 0`
- For `(0, 1)`: `new_row = 1 + 0 = 1`, `new_col = 1 + 1 = 2`

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are not assigned, we only note that they will hold the new calculated values based on the directions iterated. Moreover, other variables remain unchanged in the program.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` and `new_col` are updated based on direction pairs.**
