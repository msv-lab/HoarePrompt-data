Postcondition: ***`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains unchanged, and `current_direction_index` is increased by 1. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, `new_state` is updated with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped. Additionally, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and if `new_state_str` was not already in `visited`, it is now added to `visited`, and `queue` contains `new_state_str`. Otherwise, no updates occur in the state.***
