Postcondition: ***`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`. If `new_row` falls within the range [0, 2) and `new_col` falls within the range [0, 2), then `visited` is updated to include `new_state_str` if it was not already present, and `queue` includes `new_state_str` if it was not previously visited. Meanwhile, `current`, `new_pos`, and `new_state_str` remain unchanged.***
