According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `directions` list. If there are more direction tuples to iterate through, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `dr` and `dc` are the values for the current direction being processed. To execute the loop another time, we need to increment the index of the direction being processed. 

Assuming `directions` has at least one more element for the loop to execute again, `dr` and `dc` should be updated to the next values in the list. Hence, if we denote the index of the current direction in the `directions` list as `current_direction_index`, then we can say:

- For the loop to execute one more time, `current_direction_index` should increase by 1 to access the next direction, which means we will need to ensure next `dr` and `dc` come from the next index.
- Additionally, the `visited` and `queue` states need to reflect that they remain unchanged at this point.

Thus, the new states will be:

State: **`new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos` remain unchanged, `dr` and `dc` are the next direction values in the directions list, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1**
