Output State: **`queue` is empty, `visited` includes all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that can be reached by valid moves, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last configuration processed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`. The loop terminates when there are no valid configurations left to process in `queue`.**
