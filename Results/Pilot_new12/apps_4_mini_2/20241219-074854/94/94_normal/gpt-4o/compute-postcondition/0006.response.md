The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` will calculate the row and column of the position of the empty space based on the index `empty_pos`, which is 3. 

Using `divmod(3, 2)`, we divide 3 by 2, which gives us a quotient of 1 (for the row) and a remainder of 1 (for the column). Thus, `empty_row` will be assigned the value 1, and `empty_col` will be assigned the value 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1**
