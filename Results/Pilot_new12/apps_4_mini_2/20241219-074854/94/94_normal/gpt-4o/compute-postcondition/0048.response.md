The statement `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that contains the same elements as `current`, which indicates a copy of the current configuration. None of the other variables, such as `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `empty_pos`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, and `new_col`, are affected by this assignment. 

Since `new_state` is now a list representation of `current`, the following holds true: `new_state` is now a list representing the configuration of `current`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the next configuration from `queue`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`, `new_col` is `empty_col`, `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list representation of `current`.**
