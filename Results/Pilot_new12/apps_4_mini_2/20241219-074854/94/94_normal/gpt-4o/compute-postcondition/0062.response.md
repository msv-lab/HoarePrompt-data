`visited` is updated to include `new_state_str` by adding it to the set. The previous values of `visited`, `queue`, and `current` remain unchanged, while `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_state_str` are still defined as detailed in the initial state.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` remains unchanged.**
