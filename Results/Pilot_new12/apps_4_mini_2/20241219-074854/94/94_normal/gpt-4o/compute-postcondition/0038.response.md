Postcondition: ***If `new_row` and `new_col` are within valid bounds (from 0 to 1), the `start` remains 'ABCX', the `queue` remains unchanged as it contains 'ABXC', 'AXCB', and 'ABCX', `visited` includes 'ABCX', 'ABXC', and 'AXCB', and the `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'] with `new_state_str` being 'ABCX'. If `new_row` and `new_col` are out of bounds, the `queue` also remains unchanged under the same conditions.***
