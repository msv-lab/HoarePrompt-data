The code adds `new_state_str`, which is 'ABXC', to the `visited` set. The previous values of `visited` included only {'ABCX'}, and now it will also contain 'ABXC'. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX', 'ABXC'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 4, `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'], `new_state_str` is 'ABXC', and 'ABXC' has been added to `visited`.**
