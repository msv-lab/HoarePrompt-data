Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution plus `new_state_str`, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is unchanged; the string representation `new_state_str` created from `new_state` is now in `visited`.**
