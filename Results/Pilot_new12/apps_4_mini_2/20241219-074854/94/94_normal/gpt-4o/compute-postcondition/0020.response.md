The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned the values calculated based on the current position of the empty space (`empty_row` and `empty_col`) along with the direction values from the directions list. Specifically, `dr` and `dc` are the first direction in `directions`, which is `(-1, 0)`, indicating a movement one unit up. Therefore, `new_row` becomes `empty_row - 1` and `new_col` remains `empty_col + 0`. 

Given the initial values:
- `empty_row` is `1`
- `empty_col` is `1`

Calculating the new values:
- `new_row = 1 - 1 = 0`
- `new_col = 1 + 0 = 1`

The other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, and index) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains 'ABXC' if 'ABXC' was not previously in `visited`, `visited` includes both 'ABCX' and 'ABXC', `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0, and `new_col` is 1.
