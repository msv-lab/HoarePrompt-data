The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` assigns the index of the character 'X' in the string `current` to the variable `empty_pos`. The previous value of `empty_pos` was `3`, but this value will change based on the actual configuration stored in `current`.

Since `current` is indicated to be the next configuration from `queue`, we assume that it contains 'ABCX' or a variation of it, where 'X' is at some position that could change `empty_pos`. However, without specific information about the actual current configuration, we cannot determine the exact new value of `empty_pos`. 

The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects the value of `empty_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the next configuration from `queue`, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
