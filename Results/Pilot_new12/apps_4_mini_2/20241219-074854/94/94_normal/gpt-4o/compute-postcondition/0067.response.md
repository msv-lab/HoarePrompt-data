In this case, `new_row` and `new_col` are assigned new values based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the tuple `(dr, dc)` from the `directions`. Since the exact values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not provided, we cannot determine specific outcomes, but we understand that `new_row` and `new_col` will change based on the calculations. 

As a result, the output state reflects the new values of `new_row` and `new_col`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` is unchanged**.
