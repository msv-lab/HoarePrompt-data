The code appends `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. The values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `visited`, `current`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged. The only change occurs in `queue`, which now includes `new_state_str` as an additional element.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` is `visited` with `new_state_str` added to it, `queue` now includes `new_state_str`, `current` is unchanged, `new_pos` is equal to `2 * empty_row + 2 * dr + empty_col + dc`, `new_state_str` is equal to `''.join(new_state)`**.
