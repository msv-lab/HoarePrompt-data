`new_state_str` is assigned the value of the concatenation of the elements in the list `new_state`, which is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']. Thus, `new_state_str` becomes 'ABCX'. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'ABXC' and 'AXCB'; `visited` includes 'ABCX', 'ABXC', and 'AXCB'; `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `out of bounds`; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'; `new_row` is 1 + `dr`; `new_col` is 1 + `dc'**
