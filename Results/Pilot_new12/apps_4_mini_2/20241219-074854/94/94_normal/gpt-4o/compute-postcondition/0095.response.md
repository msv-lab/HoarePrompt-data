To evaluate the impact of the provided Python code snippet `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col`, we'll analyze the initial state of the relevant variables.

1. From the initial state, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`. This means `new_row` and `new_col` depend on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.
2. `new_pos` is calculated using the expression `new_row * 2 + new_col`.
3. Since we don't have specific numeric values for `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, or `dc`, we can represent `new_row` and `new_col` in terms of these variables. Consequently, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
  
Thus:

- `new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`

No other variables in the initial state are affected by this calculation, so we will keep them as they are.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**.
