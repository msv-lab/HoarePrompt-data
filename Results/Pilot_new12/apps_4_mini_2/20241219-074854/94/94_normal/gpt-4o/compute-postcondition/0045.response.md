In the given code snippet, `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated by adding `dr` and `dc` to `empty_row` and `empty_col`, respectively. The initial values are provided for `dr` and `dc` as -1 and 0. The `empty_row` is calculated as `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` as `empty_pos % 2`, where `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.

Since `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0, we can infer the following updates:
- `new_row` will be equal to `empty_row - 1` (this means it represents the row above the current empty position).
- `new_col` will remain the same as `empty_col` (the column stays the same).

Thus, the updates based on the initial positions will result in:
- `new_row` = `empty_row - 1`
- `new_col` = `empty_col`

There are no other variables affected by the code, and no variables are being returned. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the next configuration from `queue`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`, `new_col` is `empty_col`.**
