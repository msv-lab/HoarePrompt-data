`empty_pos` is assigned the index of 'X' in the string `current`, which is 'ABCX'. The index of 'X' in 'ABCX' is 3. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string 'ABCX'; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set containing 'ABCX'; `directions` is a list containing the tuples [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3**
