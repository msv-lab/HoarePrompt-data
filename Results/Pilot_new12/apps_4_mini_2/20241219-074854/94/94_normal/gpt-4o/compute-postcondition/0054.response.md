Postcondition: ***`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `queue` and `visited`. The `directions` remain [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], and `current` is unchanged.***
