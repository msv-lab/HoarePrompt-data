The value in `current` contains the valid configuration of 'ABCX' where 'X' represents an empty space. The `empty_pos` indicates where 'X' is located in the configuration. The code snippet swaps the positions of 'X' (at `empty_pos`) and the position calculated by `new_pos` (which comes from moving 'X' to the position above it).

Let's break down the variables that are affected:
- `new_state` is a list representation of `current`, which allows the swap to occur.
- The position of 'X' (`new_state[empty_pos]`) is exchanged with the value in the `new_pos` position (`new_state[new_pos]`).

The `empty_row` and `empty_col` denote the original position of 'X'. After the swap, `empty_pos` will change since 'X' has moved, but its new position will now reflect `new_pos`.

The current state before the swap is:
- `current`: Configuration with 'X' in a specific index.
- `empty_pos`: Index of 'X' in `current`.
- `new_pos`: Index that is calculated to find the new position of 'X'.

After the execution, the contents of `new_state` will have changed due to the swap, and the variables of interest are:
- `current` remains the same as `current` will be needed for further processing, but its representation has changed in `new_state`.
- `visited` does not change, nor do `start`, `queue`, `directions`, or the calculations for `empty_row` and `empty_col` during this execution.

Therefore, the after effect will be about the changed representation in `new_state`, with the new value in `empty_pos` reflected due to the swap operation. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains all valid configurations of 'ABCX' after popping the leftmost element, `visited` includes all unique configurations visited during the loop execution, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is unchanged; `new_state` has had the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
