The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining the elements of the list `new_state`. The value of `new_state` is ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], which results in `new_state_str` being 'AXCB'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains 'ABXC', `visited` includes both 'ABCX' and 'ABXC', `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'X', 'C', 'B'], `new_state_str` is 'AXCB'**.
