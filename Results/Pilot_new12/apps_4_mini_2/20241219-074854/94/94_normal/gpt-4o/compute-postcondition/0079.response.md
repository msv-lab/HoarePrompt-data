The variable `empty_pos` is assigned the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. The states of the other variables (`visited`, `queue`, `current`) are not directly affected by this operation, but they still retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged elements and now specifies the value of `empty_pos`.

Output State: **`visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that have been generated during the loop's execution, `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
