The code snippet `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the `visited` set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`new_state` is updated with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state` and `new_state_str` is now added to `visited`.**
