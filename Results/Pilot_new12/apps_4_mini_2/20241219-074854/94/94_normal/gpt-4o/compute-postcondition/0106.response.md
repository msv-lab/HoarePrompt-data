The `new_state` variable is assigned a new list that is a copy of the current variable. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and other variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the values that have been retained. 

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1, and `new_state` is a list copy of `current`.**
