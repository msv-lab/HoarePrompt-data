`new_state` is assigned the value of a list created from `current`. The original state of `current` is preserved as `new_state` now contains a copy of `current`, which doesn't affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains at least 1 element; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list version of `current`.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains at least 1 element; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list version of `current`.**
