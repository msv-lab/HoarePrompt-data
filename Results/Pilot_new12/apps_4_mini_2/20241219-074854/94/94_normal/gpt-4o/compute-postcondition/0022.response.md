`new_state` is assigned the value of a list created from the current string `current`, which is 'ABCX'. This means `new_state` becomes ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains 'ABXC', `visited` includes both 'ABCX' and 'ABXC', `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 1, `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X'].**
