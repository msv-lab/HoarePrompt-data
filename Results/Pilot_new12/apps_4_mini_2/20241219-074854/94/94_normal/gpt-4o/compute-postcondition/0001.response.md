The code initializes a set called `visited` containing the `start` string. The variable `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty space ('X'). This means `visited` will now hold one element, which is the value of `start`. 

The other variables in the initial state are not affected. Therefore, the output state includes the update for the `visited` variable.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty space ('X'); `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`.**
