Postcondition: ***`new_state` is updated with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `current_direction_index` is increased by 1, `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and if `new_state_str` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited`, and `queue` contains `new_state_str`.***
