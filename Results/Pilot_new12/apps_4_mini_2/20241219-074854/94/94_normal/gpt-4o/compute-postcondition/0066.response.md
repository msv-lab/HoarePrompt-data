According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `directions`, which is a collection of tuples representing the changes in row and column (`dr`, `dc`). For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more tuple (i.e., direction) in `directions` that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, the states are `new_row`, `new_col`, and `current` remain unchanged, and the state of `visited` and `queue` has been possibly updated based on the validity of `new_row`, `new_col`, and whether `new_state_str` is in `visited`.

If `directions` has at least one more tuple remaining to process, then the next values of `dr` and `dc` will be pulled from `directions`. Since we do not have information on the total number of directions processed, we can't specify an exact state, only that `dr` and `dc` will be adjusted to represent the next tuple from `directions`.

State: **`new_row` is unchanged, `new_col` is unchanged, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` is unchanged, next `(dr, dc)` will be the next tuple in `directions`**
