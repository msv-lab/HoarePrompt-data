The code swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. The values of `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain calculated but are not directly modified by this operation. Since `new_row` is calculated as `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, these values are still valid.

The state of the variables after executing the code indicates that `new_state[empty_pos]` has been set to `new_state[new_pos]`, and vice versa. 

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and `new_state` has been updated to swap the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
