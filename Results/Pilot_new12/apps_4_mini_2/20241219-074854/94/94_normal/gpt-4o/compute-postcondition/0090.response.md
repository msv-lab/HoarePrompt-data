The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The values of the other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, but now `new_state_str` is added to the `queue`. The previous values of `visited` before the append operation included `new_state_str`, and now `new_state_str` is confirmed to be in the `visited`. The other states regarding `new_row`, `new_col`, and others remain valid as they are not affected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX' plus `new_state_str`, `queue` now contains the previous elements plus `new_state_str`, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains at least 1 element, `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is modified by swapping the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, and `new_state_str` is now in `visited`.**
