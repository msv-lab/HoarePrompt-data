The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value formed by joining the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. The preceding states of all other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state reflects the modifications based on the execution of the code.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` remains unchanged, `queue` remains unchanged, `current` is unchanged, `new_pos` is equal to `2 * empty_row + 2 * dr + empty_col + dc`, `new_state_str` is equal to `''.join(new_state)`**.
