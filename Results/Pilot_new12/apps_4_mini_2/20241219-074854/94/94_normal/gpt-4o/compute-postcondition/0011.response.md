The variable `new_state` is assigned a list that is created from the string `current`. The current value of `current` is 'ABCX', so `new_state` will become a list containing the characters of this string. The other variables remain unchanged in value or state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_pos` is determined by `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']**
