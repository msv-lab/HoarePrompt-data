The value of `new_state_str` is assigned the value generated by joining the elements of `new_state` into a single string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, and `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
