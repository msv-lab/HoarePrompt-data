The code swaps the values in `new_state` at `empty_pos` (which is 3) and `new_pos`. To determine `new_pos`, we first need to compute `new_row` and `new_col` from the `empty_row` and `empty_col`. The empty position corresponds to the coordinates given by `empty_row` (1) and `empty_col` (1) in the grid. 

Given the `directions`, if we consider moving in the direction `(0, 1)`, which corresponds to the right, we would get:
- `new_row` = `empty_row + 0` = 1
- `new_col` = `empty_col + 1` = 2

This would give us `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col = 1 * 2 + 2 = 4`.

Next, we will perform the swap between `new_state[3]` and `new_state[4]`. 
- Initially, `new_state` is `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`.
- `new_state[3]` is 'X', and since we are attempting to access `new_state[4]`, the `new_state` array must be adjusted to accommodate the swap. 
- After the swap, `new_state[3]` becomes 'C', and `new_state[4]` becomes a non-existent element in its previous state, leading to an assumption that `new_state` can potentially grow the item or remain as is based on condition.

The output state should reflect the values of the variables after the swap has been executed. 
- The `new_state` array is effectively altered such that `new_state` now contains ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'].

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 4, `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C']**.
