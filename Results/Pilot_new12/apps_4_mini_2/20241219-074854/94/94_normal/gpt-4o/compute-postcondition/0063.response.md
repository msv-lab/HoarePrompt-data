The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the value of `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. Since `queue` is unchanged aside from the addition of a new element, the previous state of `queue` remains but now includes `new_state_str`. The other variables, such as `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `visited`, and `current`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `visited` now includes `new_state_str`, `queue` includes `new_state_str`, `current` remains unchanged.**
