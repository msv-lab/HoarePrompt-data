The code calculates `new_pos` based on `new_row` and `new_col`, which are determined by the positions of 'X' in `current`. Therefore, `new_pos` will be assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Since the values of `new_row` and `new_col` are known to be between 0 and 1 (inclusive), `new_pos` will have a possible value of either 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the specific values of `new_row` and `new_col`. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the final Output State is:

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains at least 1 element; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
