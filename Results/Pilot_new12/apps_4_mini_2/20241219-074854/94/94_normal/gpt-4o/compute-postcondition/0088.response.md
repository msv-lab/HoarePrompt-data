Postcondition: ***`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains at least 1 element, `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is modified by swapping the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.***
