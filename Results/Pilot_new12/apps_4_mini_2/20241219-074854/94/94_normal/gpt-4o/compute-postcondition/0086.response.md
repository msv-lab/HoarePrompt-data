The value at index `empty_pos` of `new_state` is swapped with the value at index `new_pos`. The variable `empty_pos` indicates the current position of 'X' in `current`, while `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, representing a new position based on the movement defined by `dr` and `dc`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but `new_state` is modified by the swap.

Output State: **`new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`, `visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX', `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current', `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`, `directions` contains at least 1 element; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is modified by swapping the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
