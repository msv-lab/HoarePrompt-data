The `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `''.join(new_state)`, which concatenates the list `new_state` into a single string. The `new_state` consists of the characters `['A', 'B', 'X', 'C']`, so `new_state_str` will be `'ABXC'`. The other variables remain unchanged in this context, so the output state reflects the updated value of `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` is empty, `visited` is {'ABCX'}, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 4, `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'X', 'C'], `new_state_str` is 'ABXC'**
