The code snippet `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string value `new_state_str` to the set called `visited`. Given that `new_state_str` is equal to 'ABCX', it means the state 'ABCX' will be added to the already existing set of visited states. However, 'ABCX' is already included in `visited`, so there will be no actual change to that set.

Therefore, the output state will retain all previous values, with no changes to the `visited` variable.

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX'; `queue` contains 'ABXC' and 'AXCB'; `visited` includes 'ABCX', 'ABXC', and 'AXCB'; `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is 'ABCX'; `empty_pos` is 3; `empty_row` is 1; `empty_col` is 1; `new_pos` is `out of bounds`; `new_state` is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']; `new_state_str` is 'ABCX'; `new_row` is 1 + `dr`; `new_col` is 1 + `dc'**
