The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the `queue`, modifying the state of the `queue` in the process. After this operation, the `current` variable will hold the value of the element that was removed. The `visited` state remains unchanged, and `queue` will now contain all remaining elements excluding the one that was removed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`visited` contains all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that have been generated during the loop's execution, `queue` is updated to exclude the popleft element, and `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue` before the operation.**
