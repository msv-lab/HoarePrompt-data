The new position `new_pos` is calculated using the formula `new_row * 2 + new_col`. Given that `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, the calculation results in `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is 'ABCX', `queue` contains 'ABXC', `visited` includes both 'ABCX' and 'ABXC', `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is 'ABCX', `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is 1, `new_pos` is 1.**
