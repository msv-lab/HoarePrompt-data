You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque

bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a list of two strings, each string containing exactly two characters representing the tiles ('A', 'B', 'C') and the empty cell ('X') in Bessie's puzzle.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns the concatenation of the two strings in the list 'puzzle', which contains exactly two characters each, representing the tiles and the empty cell.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `puzzle`, which is a list containing exactly two strings, each representing two characters that correspond to tiles ('A', 'B', 'C') and an empty cell ('X') in Bessie's puzzle. It returns the concatenation of these two strings. The function does not perform any validation on the input structure or content of `puzzle`, meaning it assumes the input will always meet the expected criteria. The final state of the program is that it produces a single string composed of the two input strings concatenated together, reflecting the arrangement of tiles and the empty cell without any additional transformations or checks.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string of length 4 consisting of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one empty space ('X'), representing the initial configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle.
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        
        empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                    ], new_state[empty_pos]
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `visited` includes all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that can be reached by valid moves, `directions` remains [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the last configuration processed from `queue`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is equal to `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is equal to `empty_pos % 2`. The loop terminates when there are no valid configurations left to process in `queue`.
    return visited
    #The program returns 'visited' which includes all unique configurations of 'ABCX' that can be reached by valid moves
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `start`, which represents the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle. It performs a breadth-first search to explore all unique configurations of the puzzle that can be reached by valid moves of the empty space ('X'). The function constructs a set `visited` that contains all configurations encountered during the traversal. After executing, the function returns `visited`, which represents all unique states of the puzzle starting from the initial configuration and includes configurations reachable by making legal moves. Note that the function assumes the input string is correctly formatted as a length-4 string with the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. Missing functionality includes handling invalid inputs or assumptions about the input format—which could lead to potential errors when calling methods like `index` on improperly formatted strings.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
