The function reads a positive integer `n` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 10^9`. It calculates and prints the total number of positive divisors of `n`. The function does not handle negative or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are encountered. The output will be the number of unique positive divisors of `n` displayed to the console. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
