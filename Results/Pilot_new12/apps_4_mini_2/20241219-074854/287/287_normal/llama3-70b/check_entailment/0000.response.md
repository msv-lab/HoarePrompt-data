To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we first need to fully understand the task and analyze the program logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of different weights of the splits of a given integer \( n \). A "split" is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers whose sum equals \( n \). The "weight" of a split is the count of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input \( n \).
2. **Divisor Counting Logic**:
    - The loop iterates over numbers from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
    - For each \( i \) that divides \( n \):
        - Initially, it adds 2 to `res` (counting both \( i \) and \( n/i \)).
        - If \( i \times i \) equals \( n \), it subtracts 1 from `res` to prevent double counting when \( i \) is the square root of \( n \).
3. **Output**: The result is printed.

### Discussion on Correctness:
The approach the program uses (counting divisors) does not correctly reflect the requirement of counting the distinct weights of splits. 

#### Counterexample:
- Consider \( n = 8 \):
    - Valid splits are:
        - Weight 1: [8]
        - Weight 2: [4, 4]
        - Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
        - Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
        - Weight 5: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]
        - Weight 6: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Based on the above splits, there are actually **5 distinct weights** (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).

However, the given program incorrectly counts divisors, resulting in an incorrect output because it does not calculate weights based on the splits properly. For a correct weighted count, the program should investigate deeper into valid partitions and their respective weights.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic of the program does not meet the problem requirements and is fundamentally flawed based on the input values I tested, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
