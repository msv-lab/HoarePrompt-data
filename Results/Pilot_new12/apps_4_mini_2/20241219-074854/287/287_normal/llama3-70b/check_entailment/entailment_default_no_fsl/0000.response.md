Correctness: **False**

The provided program counts the number of positive divisors of `n`, which is not aligned with the problem description. The problem is asking for the number of different weights of splits of `n`, which means it needs to analyze the partitions of `n` rather than its divisors. 

For instance, for `n = 7`, the expected output is `4`, representing the different weights of splits (1 to 7). However, the executed program would be outputting the number of divisors, so instead, it will yield an incorrect number that does not correspond to the required problem.

Thus, the code fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. As it does not correctly address the main task, which is to compute different weights of splits of `n`, the output of the program cannot be considered correct.
