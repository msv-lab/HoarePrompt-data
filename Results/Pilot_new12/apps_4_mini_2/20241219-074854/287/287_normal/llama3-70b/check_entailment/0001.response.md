Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to count the number of different weights of splits of `n`, but it does so incorrectly. 

For example, consider the input `n = 8`. According to the problem description, we know the possible weights of the splits are as follows:

- Weight 1: `[8]`
- Weight 2: `[4, 4]`
- Weight 3: `[3, 3, 2]`
- Weight 4: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
- Weight 5: `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (not possible due to nonincreasing condition)
- Weight 6: `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (not possible due to nonincreasing condition)
- Weight 7: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Thus, the correct weights for splits of `8` include weights `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, which gives a total of `5` distinct weights. 

The current logic of the function focuses on factors of `n`, which does not adequately identify the unique weights of splits based on the requirements. The function will generate incorrect or incomplete results, especially since it doesn't consider the constraints of the splits being nonincreasing.

For an input `n = 8`, the output of the program is `6` instead of the expected `5`. Therefore, it is clear that the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements for every potential case, thus confirming its incorrectness.
