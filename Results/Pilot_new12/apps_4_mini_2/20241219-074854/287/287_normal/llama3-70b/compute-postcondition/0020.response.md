The `print(res)` statement prints the current value of `res`, which is equal to the total number of positive divisors of `n`. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `res` remains unchanged by this print operation. Therefore, the output state will indicate the existing values of `res` and `n`, while specifying that `res` is the total number of positive divisors of `n`.

Output State: **`res` is equal to the total number of positive divisors of `n`, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9; printed value of res is shown.**
