According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, to determine if the loop can be executed one more time, we need to know if `i` is still within the bounds of `range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`.

Since `i` is currently 1, and the next value for `i` in the loop will be 2, for the loop to execute again, `int(n ** 0.5)` must be at least 2, which means `n` must be at least 4. 

At the start of the next iteration, `res` is still 2 unless `i * i` equals `n` for the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 2 in the next iteration, we need to understand its condition:

- If `2 * 2` equals `n`, then `res` would be set to 1.
- Otherwise, `res` remains 2.

So at the start of the next iteration, if `i` is 2, we can summarize the states as follows. 

State: **`res` is 2, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 4, and `i` is 2.**
