The value of `res` is incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `res` is 2, after executing the code, `res` becomes 4. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, with `n` as a positive integer at least 4, and `i` as 2.

Output State: **`res` is 4, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 2**
