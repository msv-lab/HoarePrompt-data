`res` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is now 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, and the current values still satisfy that `i * i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, and `i * i` is equal to `n`.**
