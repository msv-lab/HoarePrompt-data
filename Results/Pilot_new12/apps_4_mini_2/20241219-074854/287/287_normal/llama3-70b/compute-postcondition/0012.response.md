`res` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 2, so the new value of `res` will be 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and since `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4 and `i` is 2, we retain that information. Therefore, the Output State captures the current state of all relevant variables after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 4, `i` is 2**
