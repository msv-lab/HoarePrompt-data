According to the code, the loop iterates with the variable `i` starting from 1 up to the integer square root of `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `n`, which is `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. 

- If `n` equals 4, the integer square root \( \text{int}(4^{0.5}) \) is 2, meaning the loop will execute again for `i` equal to 2, but it will finish its iterations after that.
- If `n` is greater than 4, the integer square root will be greater than 2, allowing the loop to execute for `i` equal to 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be 3, and \( n \) must be either equal to or greater than 9 (making \( \text{int}(n^{0.5}) \) at least 3).

State: **`res` is initially 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
