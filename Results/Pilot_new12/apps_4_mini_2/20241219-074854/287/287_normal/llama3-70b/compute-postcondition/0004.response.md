`res` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2. The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` is still 1, which is a divisor of `n`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 2, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `n`.

Output State: **`res` is 2, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `n`.**
