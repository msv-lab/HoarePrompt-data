According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute, `int(n ** 0.5)` must be at least 1. This occurs when `n` is at least 1. 

Given that `n` is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to \(10^9\) and `res` is initialized to 0, we can conclude that the loop can execute as long as `n` is positive. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will begin at 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows:

State: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `i` is 1**
