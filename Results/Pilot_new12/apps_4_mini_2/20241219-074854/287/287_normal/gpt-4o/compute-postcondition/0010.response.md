According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i * i <= num`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is 2 and `num` is such that `1 <= num <= 10^9` and `num` is an integer divisible by `i`.

To determine if the loop can execute once more, we need to check if `i * i` (which equals 2 * 2 = 4) is less than or equal to `num`. Since `num` can be at least 1 and as much as 10^9, the only adjustment needed is that `num` must be at least 4 for the condition `i * i <= num` to hold true.

Therefore, the current conditions state that `num` should be adjusted to ensure it is at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **num must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 2, `i` is 2, `i` is a divisor of `num`**
