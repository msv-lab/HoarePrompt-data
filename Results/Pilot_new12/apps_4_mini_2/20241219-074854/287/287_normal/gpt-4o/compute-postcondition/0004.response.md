The `count` variable is incremented by 1, reflecting that the current value of `i` (which is a divisor of `num`) has contributed to the count of divisors. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `count`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 1; `i` is 1; the current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`.**
