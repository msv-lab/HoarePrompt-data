The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 3 to 4. The variables `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. `num` must still be greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is still 2 and a divisor of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is now 4, `i` is 2, and `i` is a divisor of `num`.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is now 4, `i` is 2, and `i` is a divisor of `num**.
