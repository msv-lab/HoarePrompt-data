The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The current state of `count` is 1, so after executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` becomes 2. The other variables (`num`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 2; `i` is 1; the current value of `i` is a divisor of `num`, and the current value of `i` is not equal to num divided by `i`.**
