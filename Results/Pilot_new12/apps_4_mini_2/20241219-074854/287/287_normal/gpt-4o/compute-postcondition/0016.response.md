According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `num`. The loop condition `i * i <= num` needs to be true for the loop to run again. At the end of the last iteration, we have the conditions: `num` is greater than or equal to 4, which ensures `num` is at least 4, and `i` is a divisor of `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `i` to be such that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `num`. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we can deduce that for the next iteration to proceed, the value of `i + 1` must satisfy the condition `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= num`.

- If at the end of the last iteration, `i * i` was less than or equal to `num`, but `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` must take into account that this should also be less than or equal to `num` to ensure the loop can run again.

Therefore, for the loop to run at least one more time, we need to adjust `i` so that `i` can increase to a value which satisfies the condition. If `i` at the end is at its maximum valid value (where `i * i` is still less than or equal to `num`), then `num` must be adequately large enough to allow `i + 1` to still fit.

The current condition gives us that `num` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`**
