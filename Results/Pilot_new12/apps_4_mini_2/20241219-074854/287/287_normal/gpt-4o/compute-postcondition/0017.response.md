The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it still exists as `count + 1`. The state of `num` and the condition regarding `num` being greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`; `count` has been increased by 1**
