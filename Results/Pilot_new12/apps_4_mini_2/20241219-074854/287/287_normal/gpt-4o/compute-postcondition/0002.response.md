According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i * i <= num`. For the loop to start its first iteration, the value of `i * i` must be less than or equal to `num`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `i` is 1
- `num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9

Calculating `i * i` gives us 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least the first time, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which is already satisfied since the minimum value of `num` is 1).

Thus, no adjustments are needed for the state variables to ensure the loop can execute one time. 

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; `count` is 0; `i` is 1**
