`i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially 1, after the operation `i += 1`, `i` will now be 2. The states of `num` and `count` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; if `num` is divisible by `i`, then `count` is 2, `i` is 2, and `i` is a divisor of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9; if `num` is divisible by `i`, then `count` is 2, `i` is 2, and `i` is a divisor of `num.**
