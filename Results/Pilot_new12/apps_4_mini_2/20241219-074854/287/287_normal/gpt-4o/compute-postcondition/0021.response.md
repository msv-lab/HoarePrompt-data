The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `num` being an integer greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` and the conditions concerning `count` and divisibility remain unchanged. However, since `i` is now updated, if it was initially equal to 0, for example, the new value of `i` would be 1, which affects the conditions where `num` is compared to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`. The state of other variables remains valid.

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`; `count` may still be increased by 1 based on previous conditions; `i` is now incremented by 1.**
