Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not address the problem as described in the prompt. 

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the number of distinct weights of splits of the input integer `n`, where a split is defined as a non-increasing sequence of positive integers that sum to `n`. Each weight of a split corresponds to the count of how many times the first element of that split appears.

2. **Current Implementation Logic**: The function `func_1` currently counts the number of divisors of the input `n`. This is a completely different operation and does not relate to the defined notion of splits and their weights.

3. **Counterexample**: For instance, consider the case when `n = 7`. The weights for the splits are as follows:
   - Weight 1: [7]
   - Weight 2: [3, 3, 1] 
   - Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1] 
   - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

   The correct output for `n = 7` should be `4` (weights 1, 2, 3, and 7). However, since the current program counts divisors, it will output a value related to the number of divisors of `7`, which is `2` (the divisors are 1 and 7), hence it is incorrect.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly compute the number of different weights of the splits for any case, the output is determined to be incorrect.
