You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not address the problem as described in the prompt. 

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the number of distinct weights of splits of the input integer `n`, where a split is defined as a non-increasing sequence of positive integers that sum to `n`. Each weight of a split corresponds to the count of how many times the first element of that split appears.

2. **Current Implementation Logic**: The function `func_1` currently counts the number of divisors of the input `n`. This is a completely different operation and does not relate to the defined notion of splits and their weights.

3. **Counterexample**: For instance, consider the case when `n = 7`. The weights for the splits are as follows:
   - Weight 1: [7]
   - Weight 2: [3, 3, 1] 
   - Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1] 
   - Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

   The correct output for `n = 7` should be `4` (weights 1, 2, 3, and 7). However, since the current program counts divisors, it will output a value related to the number of divisors of `7`, which is `2` (the divisors are 1 and 7), hence it is incorrect.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly compute the number of different weights of the splits for any case, the output is determined to be incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `num`, constrained such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, and returns the total number of positive divisors of `num`. The function calculates this by iterating from `1` to the square root of `num`. For each integer `i` that divides `num` without a remainder, it increments a count of divisors by one, and if `i` is not equal to the complementary divisor (`num // i`), it increments the count again. After executing, `num` remains unchanged, and the final output reflects the complete count of all divisors of `num`, including both perfect squares and distinct pairs of divisors. The function properly handles various edge cases, such as when `num` is a perfect square, by ensuring it does not double count the root divisor. There is no indication of missing functionality for the provided defined range of input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
