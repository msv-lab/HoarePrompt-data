Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits for the given integer \( n \). However, the implemented function `func_1(num)` calculates the total number of divisors of \( num \) instead of counting the different possible weights of its splits.

To elaborate:
1. The weight of a split is defined based on how many times the first element of the split appears. The weights correspond to how many times the largest integer in any valid split can be used in such a way that the sum equals \( n \).
2. The program instead counts the divisors of \( n \) and returns this count. The number of divisors has no correlation with the weights of the splits, as weights are concerned with partitions of the number rather than its divisors.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task at hand is not about finding divisors but about counting valid partition weights, which are two entirely different computations.

In summary, the program is incorrect, and the explanation above outlines its failure to meet the requirements specified in the original problem description.
