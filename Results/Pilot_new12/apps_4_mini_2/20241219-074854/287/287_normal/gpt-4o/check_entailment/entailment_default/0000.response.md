The provided program calculates the total number of positive divisors of a number `n`, but it does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. Based on the problem description, a "split" is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of times the first element appears in that split.

The output hints indicate that the function is only counting divisors of `num`, which does not address the requirements of the problem. The output examples provided (e.g., for `n = 7`, the output is `4`, indicating different weights) are not reflective of the divisor count but rather of the potential splits of the number.

Since the code does not fulfill the problem requirements and is fundamentally solving a different problem (counting divisors instead of counting weights of splits), it fails to handle the described edge cases and logical structure of the main task.

Correctness: **False**
