Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description, which requires counting the number of different weights of splits of \( n \). The provided code instead computes the total number of positive divisors of \( n \). This does not align with the requirement for counting distinct weights of splits.

For instance, in the case where \( n = 8 \), the weights of the valid splits need to be derived from the sequence definitions, which should yield 5 distinct weights ([1],[2,2],[3,3,2],[4,4],[5,2,1]). However, the code outputs the number of divisors instead, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

The function's output is unrelated to the splits of \( n \) as per the problem description, confirming that the code does not function as intended for all inputs.
