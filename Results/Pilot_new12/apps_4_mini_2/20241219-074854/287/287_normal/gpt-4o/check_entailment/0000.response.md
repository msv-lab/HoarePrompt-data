To evaluate the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and verify if it correctly computes the number of different weights of splits for a given integer `n`.

The problem describes weights of splits of `n`, where a split is defined as a non-increasing sequence of integers that sum up to `n`. The weight of a split is the number of occurrences of the first element in the split.

The provided program contains the following critical components:

1. It reads an integer `n`.
2. It calculates the `count` of divisors of `n`.

However, this logic does not correspond to the count of different weights of splits. The calculation of the number of divisors does not equate to counting the different weights of non-increasing splits. 

For example,
- For `n = 8`, the valid splits are:
  - Weight 1: `[8]`
  - Weight 2: `[4, 4]`
  - Weight 3: `[3, 3, 2]`
  - Weight 4: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
  - Weight 5: `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Weight 6: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  This results in 5 different weights: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Yet, the program simply returns the number of divisors. 

Thus, testing some values:
- If we analyze `n = 7`, the valid weights would be {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 different weights).
- If we analyze `n = 8`, as mentioned, it should return 5 distinct weights.

This analysis reveals that the output of the program does not align with the expected outcomes described in the problem. The fact that the weight calculation logic is completely flawed indicates that this program will not produce correct results for various inputs.

For the example test cases:
1. For `n = 7`, the program outputs 3 (which is the number of divisors of 7, incorrectly calculated).
2. For `n = 8`, it would incorrectly output 4 (because it counts its divisors).

Thus, since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement and can fail for various inputs:

Correctness: **False**.
