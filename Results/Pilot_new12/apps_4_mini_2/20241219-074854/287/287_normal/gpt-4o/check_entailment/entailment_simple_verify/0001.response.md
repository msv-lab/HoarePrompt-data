Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to meet the problem description, which requires calculating the number of different weights of the splits of an integer `n`. Instead, the program implements a function that counts the number of divisors of `n`, which is entirely unrelated to the specified task. 

The annotated code confirms this by showing that the function `func_1` iterates through possible divisors and counts them, returning this count as the output. This approach does not correspond to calculating splits or their weights of the integer `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
