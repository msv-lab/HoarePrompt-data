The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(num)` calculates the number of divisors of the integer `num` instead of counting the different weights of splits of `n`. Since the weights of splits and the number of divisors are conceptually different, the logic implemented in the program diverges from the required behavior specified in the problem description.

The annotated code reinforces this evaluation by clarifying the state of the program at key points, confirming that the `count` variable accumulates the total number of divisors and not the different weights of the splits.

The reasoning aligned with the original assessment remains valid: for each specific integer `n`, the number of different weights of its splits is not the same as the number of its divisors. This shows a clear misalignment with the problem requirements.

In conclusion, the assessment maintains its accuracy given that the output from the program does not correspond with the outputs specified in the provided examples of the problem.

Final: **False**
