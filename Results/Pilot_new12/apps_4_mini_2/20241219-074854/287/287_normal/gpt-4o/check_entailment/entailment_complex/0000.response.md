Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the task described in the problem statement. 

The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). The weights of splits are defined by how many times the first element appears in the split. For example, for \( n = 7 \), the possible weights are determined by various sequences that sum to 7, resulting in weights of 1, 2, 3, and 7.

However, the function `func_1` currently calculates the total number of positive divisors of the input integer \( num \). It counts how many integers divide \( num \) without a remainder, which is unrelated to counting the weights of splits of \( n \). 

Since the function does not perform the required task according to the problem description, the output generated by this program will not correspond to the expected outputs as illustrated in the examples (for example, \( n = 7 \) should output 4, but this function will output the number of divisors of 7, which is incorrect).

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
