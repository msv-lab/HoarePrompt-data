The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `num`, constrained such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, and returns the total number of positive divisors of `num`. The function calculates this by iterating from `1` to the square root of `num`. For each integer `i` that divides `num` without a remainder, it increments a count of divisors by one, and if `i` is not equal to the complementary divisor (`num // i`), it increments the count again. After executing, `num` remains unchanged, and the final output reflects the complete count of all divisors of `num`, including both perfect squares and distinct pairs of divisors. The function properly handles various edge cases, such as when `num` is a perfect square, by ensuring it does not double count the root divisor. There is no indication of missing functionality for the provided defined range of input.
