#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is such that `i * i` is greater than `num`, `count` is the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`, and `num` remains unchanged.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of divisors of the original value of 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `num`, constrained such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, and returns the total number of positive divisors of `num`. The function calculates this by iterating from `1` to the square root of `num`. For each integer `i` that divides `num` without a remainder, it increments a count of divisors by one, and if `i` is not equal to the complementary divisor (`num // i`), it increments the count again. After executing, `num` remains unchanged, and the final output reflects the complete count of all divisors of `num`, including both perfect squares and distinct pairs of divisors. The function properly handles various edge cases, such as when `num` is a perfect square, by ensuring it does not double count the root divisor. There is no indication of missing functionality for the provided defined range of input.
