The function reads two integers, `n` (the number of cost elements) and `L` (the target volume), followed by a list of `n` integers representing costs. It computes the minimum cost to achieve the exact volume `L` using combinations of powers of 2 derived from a starting index of 0 up to `n-1`. Each corresponding cost from the list can be added only if the power of 2 (computed as `2
