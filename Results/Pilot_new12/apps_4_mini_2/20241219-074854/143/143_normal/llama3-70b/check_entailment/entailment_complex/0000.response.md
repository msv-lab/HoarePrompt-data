Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem requirements as described. 

### Issues:
1. **Volume Calculation**:
   - The volume of a single bottle of type `i` is incorrectly computed in the line `vol = 2 ** j - 1`. According to the problem statement, the volume should be `2^j` (or `1 << j`) rather than `2^j - 1`. The correct volumes should be: 
     - For `j=0`, volume `1`
     - For `j=1`, volume `2`
     - For `j=2`, volume `4`
     - For `j=3`, volume `8`
     - and so forth, up to `2^(n-1)` for the maximum bottle type.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The algorithm attempts to create a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum cost for each volume from `0` to `L`. However, due to the incorrect volume calculation, the results calculated in the `dp` array will not correspond correctly to the minimum cost required to achieve the necessary lemonade volume. Using `2^j - 1` instead of `2^j` means that the volumes available from the bottles will miss the exact required volumes, and therefore the dynamic programming array will hold incorrect values.

3. **Output Condition**:
   - The output statement `print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)` is misleading in terms of how results are returned based on problem description. According to the problem, you should return the cost. The case where it's possible to buy enough lemonade should not output `-1` in case of achieving exactly `L` unless it's impossible to reach `L` which should not exist given the problem constraints of infinite bottles - this output clause is not aligned with the problem.

These fundamental misunderstandings of volume computation and the implications on volume availability lead to the program potentially not providing the correct cost for obtaining at least `L` liters of lemonade. Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements as stated in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
