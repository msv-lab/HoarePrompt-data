You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input

Output
30

Input

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program
The goal of the program is to determine the minimum cost to purchase at least \( L \) liters of lemonade, given \( n \) types of bottles with specific volumes and costs. Each bottle type \( i \) has a volume of \( 2^i - 1 \) liters and costs \( c_i \) roubles.

1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size \( L + 1 \) with `float('inf')` to indicate that the initial costs to achieve each volume are infinite.
   - `dp[0]` is set to 0, meaning that zero liters require zero cost.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For every volume \( i \) from 1 to \( L \), the code checks every bottle type \( j \).
   - The volume for bottle type \( j \) is calculated as \( 2^j - 1 \).
   - If the volume of bottle type \( j \) can contribute to the current volume \( i \) (i.e., \( vol \leq i \)), it updates the cost at `dp[i]` to the minimum of the current cost or the cost to reach volume \( i - vol \) plus the cost of one bottle of type \( j \).

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints `dp[L]`, which holds the minimum cost to achieve at least \( L \) liters.
   - If it remains `float('inf')`, meaning it wasn't possible to achieve that volume with the given bottles, it returns -1.

### Edge Case Analysis
One potential issue arises with how the program calculates bottle volumes. Specifically, the expression \( 2^j - 1 \) can lead to a false premise regarding the actual growing volume as \( j \) increases. 

For instance, considering the capacity of the bottles:
- For \( j = 0 \): \( vol = 2^0 - 1 = 0 \) liters (which should not contribute as you cannot buy a 0-liter bottle).
- For \( j = 1 \): \( vol = 2^1 - 1 = 1 \) liter.
- For \( j = 2 \): \( vol = 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) liters.
- For \( j = 3 \): \( vol = 2^3 - 1 = 7 \) liters.
- For \( j = 4 \): \( vol = 2^4 - 1 = 15 \) liters.
- And so on.

The increment in volume results in larger jumps as \( j \) increases. This could lead to situations where exact volumes can be skipped, affecting the minimum cost calculation when \( L \) is not a direct multiple or sum of the available volumes.

### Potential Failing Case
If we consider the input:
```
2 8
10 20
```
- The bottles provide a volume of bottles as follows:
 1. Bottle 1: \( 2^0 - 1 = 0 \) liters (not practical).
 2. Bottle 2: \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \) liter.
 3. Bottle 3: \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) liters. 
 4. Bottle 4: \( 2^3 - 1 = 7 \) liters.
 5. Bottle 5: \( 2^4 - 1 = 15 \) liters (not useful above 8).

The goal is to reach 8 liters. The nearest feasible configuration under best cost would use:
- One bottle of 7 liters (cost 20)
- One additional bottle for at least 1 liter. However, if fewer or no 1-liter bottles are properly considered due to how volume calculation is initialized, it could yield an infinite scenario, ultimately failing to find a solution.

### Conclusion
Based on this reasoning, the program does not correctly account for certain input cases and could return incorrect results due to miscalculating the effective usable volumes. Therefore,

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), L is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9, and c is a list of n integers where each c_i is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer; `dp` is a list where each index `i` from 0 to `L` potentially contains the minimum cost to achieve volume `i` considering all possible volumes derived from the `c` list; if no valid volumes are found for an index, it will remain at `float('inf')`.
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
