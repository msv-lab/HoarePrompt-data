Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated based on the calculation of `min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])`, considering index boundary conditions and the validity of `dp` and `costs`.***
