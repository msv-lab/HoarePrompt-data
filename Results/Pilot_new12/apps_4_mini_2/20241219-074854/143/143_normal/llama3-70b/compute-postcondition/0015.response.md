The code assigns a new value to `vol` based on the expression `2 ** j - 1`. The previous value of `j` is 2, so we calculate `vol` as follows:

\[
vol = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
\]

Therefore, only the value of `vol` changes, while `n`, `L`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

The Output State is:
`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3.**
