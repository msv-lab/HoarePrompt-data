Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `vol` is 7; `dp[1]` is updated considering the minimum values derived from previous updates based on the `costs` array. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 0), `dp[1]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
