The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this calculation results in `vol = 2 ** 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `vol = 2 - 1`, resulting in `vol = 1`. The initial states of the other variables remain valid, so we note that `n` is still an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1 after executing the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
