According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` compared to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, meaning `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment by 1, so `j` will be 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than `j`, or in this case, `n` must be greater than 1 since `j` is incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 0; and `n` must be greater than 1**
