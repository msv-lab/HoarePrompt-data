Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0. If `vol` is less than or equal to 2, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. Otherwise, no updates occur since there is no else part to consider.***
