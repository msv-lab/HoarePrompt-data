`dp[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The list `dp` of length `L + 1`, initialized with `float('inf')`, is modified such that the first element (at index `0`) is now `0`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive); `L` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `costs` is a list of `n` integers equal to the inputs provided; `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` initialized with the value `0` at index `0` and `float('inf')` elsewhere.**
