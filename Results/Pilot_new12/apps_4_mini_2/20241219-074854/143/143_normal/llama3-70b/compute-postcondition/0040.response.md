According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `n` is between 1 and 30, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will increase by 1, so `j` will be 1.

Thus, the new state should reflect that `j` is now 1. The values of `n`, `L`, `i`, and `vol` remain unchanged. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `vol` is 0**
