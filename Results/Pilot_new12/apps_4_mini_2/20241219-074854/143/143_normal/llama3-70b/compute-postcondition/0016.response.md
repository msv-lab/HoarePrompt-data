The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` impacts the variables `dp[i]`, `dp[i - vol]`, and `costs[j]`. 

1. We are at index `i = 1`, and `vol = 3`, so we will be looking up the value of `dp[1 - 3]` which is `dp[-2]`. Since Python lists do not support negative indices when accessing explicitly in this context, assuming `dp` is defined with valid non-negative indices up to a certain length (e.g., 0 to n), this action will lead to an IndexError if `dp` does not account for negative indices. If we're instead looking at a valid structure, we'd consider `i - vol` as an out-of-bounds index, which could be ignored or returned as infinity (but specific details are missing based on the provided values).

2. The comparison `min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` attempts to assign the minimum of the current value at `dp[i]` and some `cost` function's outcome. Without the specifics of `dp` and `costs`, we can't determine exact min values, but if we assume `dp` includes non-negative values and valid entries for the calculation, then `dp[1]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and whatever `dp[-2] + costs[j]` calculates to (unless this would raise an error).

Assuming `dp[-2]` doesn't lead to computation, we keep the consideration valid and note how `vol` affects index calculations leading to context. 

However, since multiple values can result, we summarize the actions indicating the usage of `i`, `j`, `vol` but without specific guaranteed outcomes due to indexing:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and potentially `dp[i]` is updated based on the calculation of `min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])`, noting index boundary conditions and output may vary depending on `dp` and `costs` validity.**
