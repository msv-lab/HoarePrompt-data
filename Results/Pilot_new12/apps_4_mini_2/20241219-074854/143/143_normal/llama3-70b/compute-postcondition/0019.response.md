According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i` which is defined in the range from 1 to `L + 1`. The current value of `i` is 1, which means that for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 after this iteration. 

Since `i` is currently 1, it will be updated to 2 for the next iteration. The loop can continue as long as `i` remains less than or equal to `L`. Given that `L` is at least 1, `i` will then be 2 for the next iteration. 

The states remaining to be considered are `n`, `j`, and `vol`, which are unchanged since they do not impact the execution of the next iteration. Thus, we will maintain their current values.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `vol` is 7**
