The variable `costs` is assigned the value of a list generated by mapping the input integers to integers. The input will provide a series of integers that correspond to `c` as well, so the length of `costs` will be equal to `n`, with each integer in `costs` being between 1 and 10^9, which is consistent with the preconditions for `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive); `L` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs_i` is equal to the inputs provided.**
