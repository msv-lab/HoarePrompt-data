Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer; `dp` is a list where each index `i` from 0 to `L` potentially contains the minimum cost to achieve volume `i` considering all possible volumes derived from the `c` list; if no valid volumes are found for an index, it will remain at `float('inf')`.**
