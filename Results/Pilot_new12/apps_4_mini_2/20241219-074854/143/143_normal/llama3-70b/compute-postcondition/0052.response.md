Functionality: **The function reads two integers, `n` (the number of cost elements) and `L` (the target volume), followed by a list of `n` integers representing costs. It computes the minimum cost to achieve the exact volume `L` using combinations of powers of 2 derived from a starting index of 0 up to `n-1`. Each corresponding cost from the list can be added only if the power of 2 (computed as `2 ** j - 1`) does not exceed the current volume index. The function prints the minimum cost to achieve volume `L`, or `-1` if it is not possible to achieve this volume. It is important to note that if `dp[L]` remains at `float('inf')`, it indicates that no combination can meet the required volume `L`, and thus `-1` is returned. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the result directly.**
