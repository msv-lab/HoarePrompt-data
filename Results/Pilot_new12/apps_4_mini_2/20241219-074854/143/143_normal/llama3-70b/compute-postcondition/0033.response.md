Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30; `L` is a positive integer of at least 1; `i` is 2; `j` is `n - 1`; `vol` is `2^(n - 1) - 1`. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. If `vol` is greater than `i` for all iterations, `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its original value.**
