The code assigns the value of `vol` as `2 ** j - 1`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0. Therefore, `2 ** j` calculates to `2 ** 0`, which is 1. Subtracting 1 gives `vol` the new value of 0.

The preconditions for the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**
