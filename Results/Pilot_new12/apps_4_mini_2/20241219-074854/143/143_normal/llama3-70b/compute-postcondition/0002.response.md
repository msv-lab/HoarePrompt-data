The variable `dp` is initialized as a list containing `float('inf')` for each integer from `0` to `L` inclusive. Since `L` is a positive integer less than or equal to `10^9`, the length of the list `dp` will be `L + 1`. The previous values of `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the list assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive); `L` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each `costs_i` is equal to the inputs provided; `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` initialized with `float('inf')`.**
