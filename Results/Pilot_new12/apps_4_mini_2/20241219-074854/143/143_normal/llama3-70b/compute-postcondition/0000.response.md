The values of `n` and `L` are assigned from the input after being converted from strings to integers. The input will provide specific values for both `n` and `L`, but the exact values are not determined here. The `c` list remains unchanged, as the provided code only affects `n` and `L`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive); `L` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9; `c` is a list of n integers where each c_i is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `n` and `L` are assigned from input integers.**
