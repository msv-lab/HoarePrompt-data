The line of code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` affects the value of `dp[i]`. The `min` function compares the current value of `dp[i]` with the value calculated as `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. 

Given that:
- `i` is `3`
- `vol` is `1`
- `j` is `1`

This means we are accessing `dp[3]`, comparing it with `dp[2] + costs[1]`. The value of `n` does not directly affect this assignment, and the values of `L` and `vol` are not changed by this operation. The main impact is on the `dp` array at index `i`.

Thus, the output state involves stating the result of the operation on `dp[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp[3]` is changed to `min(dp[3], dp[2] + costs[1])`**.
