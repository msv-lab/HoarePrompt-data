The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` calculates the value of `vol` based on the value of `j`. Since the initial state specifies that `j` is 1, the calculation proceeds as follows:

- `vol` becomes `2 ** 1 - 1`, which equals `2 - 1 = 1`.

The other variables' states remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will include the updated value of `vol` and maintain the original conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1; and `n` must be greater than 1**.
