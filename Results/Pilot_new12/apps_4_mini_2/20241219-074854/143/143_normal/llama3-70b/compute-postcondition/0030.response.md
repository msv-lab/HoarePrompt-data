The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Since `j` is currently 2, the calculation becomes `2 ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `4 - 1`, resulting in `vol` being assigned the value `3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 30; `L` is a positive integer of at least 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `vol` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30; `L` is a positive integer of at least 1; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `vol` is 3.**
