The code snippet checks the value at index `L` of the list `dp`. If `dp[L]` is not equal to `float('inf')`, it prints that value; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The variable `dp` remains unmodified after this operation. The values of the other variables `n` and `L` are still valid, but `dp[L]` determines what will be printed.

Since `dp[L]` could either be a valid minimum cost or `float('inf')`, the output depends on this check.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer; print(dp[L]) if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1.**
