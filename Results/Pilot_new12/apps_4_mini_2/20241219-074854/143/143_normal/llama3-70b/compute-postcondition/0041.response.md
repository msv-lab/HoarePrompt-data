The code assigns the value of `vol` to be calculated as `2 ** j - 1`. The previous value of `j` is 1, so the calculation will be `2 ** 1 - 1`, which evaluates to `2 - 1 = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**.
