`vol` is assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `j` minus `1`. Since `j` must be `0`, the calculation results in `vol = 2 ** 0 - 1`, which simplifies to `vol = 1 - 1 = 0`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0.
