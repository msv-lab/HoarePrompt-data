`vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. The previous value of `j` is 0, so `2 ** j` evaluates to `2 ** 0`, which is 1. Therefore, `vol` will be equal to `1 - 1`, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` is a positive integer of at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**
