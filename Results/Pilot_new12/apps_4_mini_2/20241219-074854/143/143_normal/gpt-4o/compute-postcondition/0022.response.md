The variable `L` is decremented by the value of `1 << i`, which is the bitwise left-shift of `1` by `i` bits (where `i` is 30). Therefore, `1 << 30` equals `1073741824`. Consequently, the value of `L` is reduced by `1073741824`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30]`, `i` is 30, `L` is reduced by `1073741824`.**
