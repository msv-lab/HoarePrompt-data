According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Now `i` will be 1, and since `n` is at least 1, it allows the loop to continue at least for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp[1]` must be updated with the new minimum of its previous value and `c[1]`**
