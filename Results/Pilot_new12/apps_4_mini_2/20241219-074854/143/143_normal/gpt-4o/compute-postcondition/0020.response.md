Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is 0, and `i` will start at 30. The value of `L` is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by `i` (2^i).***
