According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 31. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now 1. Once the loop executes again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must become 2, which is still less than 31. 

The program state does not change the values in `dp`, `c`, or the range of `n` because the loop simply increases the index `i`.

State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 2, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`**
