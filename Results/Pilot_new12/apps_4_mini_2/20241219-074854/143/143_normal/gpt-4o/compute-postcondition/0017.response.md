`answer` is assigned the value of `max_cost`. Since the previous states of `dp`, `n`, and `c` remain unchanged and their definitions do not depend on `answer`, the output state will reflect the assignment operation. 

Output State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs calculated for all indices from 0 to 30, where for each index `i` from 1 to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to the minimum of former `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`; `n` is between 1 and 30; `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`.**
