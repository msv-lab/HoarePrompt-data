The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30. `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9. `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum cost calculated based on the values in `current_cost`, which is derived from meaningful minimum costs stored in `dp` for the necessary indices, and potentially reduced by `L` if sufficient to cover costs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a positive integer `L`, and a list of positive integers `costs`, returning the minimum cost based on the provided constraints and calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), L (a positive integer), and costs (a list of positive integers), returning the minimum cost derived from the calculations involving these inputs.**
