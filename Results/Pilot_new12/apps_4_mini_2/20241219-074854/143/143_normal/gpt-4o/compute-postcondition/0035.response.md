Output State: **`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `L` is reduced to 0 if the initial value was sufficient to cover costs, `answer` is the minimum cost calculated based on the values in `current_cost`, and `current_cost` contains the sum of appropriate `dp[i]` values based on the power of two representations accommodated by `L`.**
