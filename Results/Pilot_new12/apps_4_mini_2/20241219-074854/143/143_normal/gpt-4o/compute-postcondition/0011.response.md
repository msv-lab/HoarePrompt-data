`dp[i]` is assigned the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. The variable `i` is currently 1, which means we are looking at the first index. Other variables, such as `dp` and `c`, maintain their previous values as they do not change directly by this code. The calculation depends on the specific values of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]`. 

Thus, if `dp[0]` is the minimum cost for the first element, `dp[1]` will be compared to `dp[0] * 2`. 

The Output State therefore reflects the unchanged state of `dp` and `c`, as well as the new calculation for `dp[1]`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is now 1, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`, and `dp[1]` is now min(`dp[1]`, `dp[0] * 2`)**.
