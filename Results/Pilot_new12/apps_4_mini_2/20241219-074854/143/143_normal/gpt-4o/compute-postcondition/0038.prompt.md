You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for the first `n` indices, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is `n-1`, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the minimum costs calculated for all indices from 0 to 30, where for each index `i` from 1 to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to the minimum of former `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`; `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `L` is reduced to 0 if the initial value was sufficient to cover costs, `answer` is the minimum cost calculated based on the values in `current_cost`, and `current_cost` contains the sum of appropriate `dp[i]` values based on the power of two representations accommodated by `L`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost calculated based on the values in 'current_cost', which is derived from meaningful minimum costs stored in 'dp' for the necessary indices, and potentially reduced by 'L' if sufficient to cover costs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n (an integer), L (a positive integer), and costs (a list of positive integers), returning the minimum cost derived from the calculations involving these inputs.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the minimum cost calculated based on the values in 'current_cost', which is derived from meaningful minimum costs stored in 'dp' for the necessary indices, and potentially reduced by 'L' if sufficient to cover costs.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
