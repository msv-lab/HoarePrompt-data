The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial state does not provide any information about the previous values of `current_cost`, so we acknowledge that it is now set to `0`. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs calculated for all indices from 0 to 30, where for each index `i` from 1 to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to the minimum of former `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`; `n` is between 1 and 30; `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`; `current_cost` is 0**.
