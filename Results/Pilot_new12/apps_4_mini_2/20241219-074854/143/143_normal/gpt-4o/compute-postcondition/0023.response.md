Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30]`, `i` is 30, and if `L` is greater than or equal to `1073741824`, then `L` is reduced by `1073741824`.***
