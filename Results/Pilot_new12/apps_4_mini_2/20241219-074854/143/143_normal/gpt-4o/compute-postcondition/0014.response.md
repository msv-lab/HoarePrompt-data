According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range defined in the loop statement. The loop iterates from 1 to 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the next `i` will be 3 for the next iteration of the loop.

Since the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to 30, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Additionally, `n` is already confirmed to be between 1 and 30, so it won't change in this context.

So, the state needs to be updated to reflect `i` being incremented by 1 and still ensuring that `dp` is defined as having the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`.

State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 3**
