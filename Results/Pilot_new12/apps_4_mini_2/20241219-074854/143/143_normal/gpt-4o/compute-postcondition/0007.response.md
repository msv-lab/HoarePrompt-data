According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2.

Since `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 because now `i` would be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])`**
