The code snippet updates `current_cost` by adding the value from the list `dp` at index `i` (which starts at 30). Since `dp` holds meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30 and `i` is currently set to 30, we can assume `dp[30]` is valid. The value of `current_cost` is updated from its initial value of 0 to `0 + dp[30]`.

The variable `current_cost` is now equal to `dp[30]`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30]`, and `i` is 30.**
