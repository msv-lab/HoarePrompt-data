The statement `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` assigns the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2` to `dp[i]`. 

The initial state indicates that:
- `dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`.
- `n` is between 1 and 30, which means `i` can be at least `2` and at most `n-1`.
- `c` contains the original costs.

Let's denote:
- The current value of `dp[i]` will be checked against `dp[i - 1] * 2`.
- The value `dp[i - 1]` is already known from the previous state of the `dp` list and can be multiplied by 2.

This will specifically update only the value of `dp[i]`. The values of `dp` for indices other than `i` and any other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated to min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)**
