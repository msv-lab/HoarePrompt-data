Output State: **`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `answer` is updated to `min(answer, dp[30] + (L > 0) * dp[30])`, `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30] + dp[29]`, `i` is 29, `L` is reduced by `1 << 29`, which is equivalent to `L - 536870912`.**
