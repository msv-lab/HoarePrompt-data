Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, and `L` has been reduced if it was greater than or equal to `536870912`. If `L` is greater than or equal to `2^29`, then `current_cost` is updated to `dp[30] + dp[29] + dp[29]`, and `answer` is updated to the minimum value of itself and `current_cost + dp[29]`.***
