The value of `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, which is equivalent to `1` left-shifted by `29` (the current value of `i`). This means `L` is reduced by `536870912`. Other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `L` has been reduced by `536870912` if it was greater than or equal to `536870912`, `current_cost` is `dp[30] + dp[29] + dp[29]`, `i` is 29.**
