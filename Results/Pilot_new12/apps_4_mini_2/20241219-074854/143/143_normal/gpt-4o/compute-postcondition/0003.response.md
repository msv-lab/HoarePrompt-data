According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. It indicates that the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, this means that the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Additionally, at the end of the last iteration of the loop, the variable `i` would be equal to `n - 1`, indicating the last valid index for this loop.

Thus, to summarize:

- For the loop to be executed at least once, `n` must be at least 1 (which it is, as per the provided state).
- Initially, `i` must start at 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
