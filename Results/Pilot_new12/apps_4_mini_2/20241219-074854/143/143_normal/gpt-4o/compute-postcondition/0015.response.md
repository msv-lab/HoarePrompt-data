The code assigns the minimum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means we are evaluating `dp[3]` and comparing it with twice the value of `dp[2]`. The exact effect on `dp` depends on the current values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]`, but we know that after this operation, `dp[3]` will hold at least the same value or potentially a lower one depending on which value is less.

Thus, the previous values of `dp` remain unchanged except for `dp[3]`, which will be updated. 

The output state reflects that `dp[3]` has been modified according to the minimum condition applied.

Output State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for indices 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is 3; `dp[3]` is updated to min(`dp[3]`, `dp[2] * 2`)**.
