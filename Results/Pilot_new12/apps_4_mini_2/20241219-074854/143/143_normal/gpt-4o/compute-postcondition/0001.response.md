The code initializes a list `dp` with a fixed size of 31, where each element is set to the value of `max_cost`. The variable `max_cost` has a set value of \(10^{18}\). The variable `dp` will now hold identical values of \(10^{18}\) for all indices from 0 to 30.

The states of the other variables `n`, `L`, `costs` are not affected by this operation, so they remain as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is 10^18.**
