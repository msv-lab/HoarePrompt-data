To analyze the final output state after the for loop has executed all iterations, we observe the looping structure and variables involved. The loop iterates from 1 to 30, updating the `dp` array based on its current value and the value of the previous index multiplied by 2. The key points to remember are the initialization and updating of `dp`.

Initial State: 
`dp` contains minimum costs from `c` for the first `n` indices, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is `n-1`, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.

After executing all iterations of the loop:
- The loop will execute for all values of `i` from 1 to 30 regardless of the value of `n` because it doesnâ€™t depend on `n` during its execution but will be conditioned by the values in the `dp` array.
- For `i = 1`, `dp[1]` will be updated to `min(dp[1], dp[0] * 2)`.
- For each subsequent `i`, `dp[i]` will continue getting updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` for all `i` from 1 to 30.

Given that `n` is at least 1, it means we have relevant data in `dp` up to at least `dp[0]` which influences the subsequent updates. For `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` retains its original computed minimum from `c` but also reflects necessary adjustments for the additional indices (if `n < 30`).

Output State: **`dp` contains the minimum costs calculated for all indices from 0 to 30, where for each index `i` from 1 to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to the minimum of former `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`; `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.**
