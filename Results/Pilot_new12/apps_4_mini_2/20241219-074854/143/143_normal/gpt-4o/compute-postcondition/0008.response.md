The variable `i` is equal to 2. The line of code updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value `dp[i]` and the value of `c[i]`. Since `i` is 2, we need to evaluate `dp[2] = min(dp[2], c[2])` where `dp[1]` has already been updated to `min(dp[1], c[1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dp[1]` is equal to `min(dp[1], c[1])`, and `dp[2]` is updated to `min(dp[2], c[2])`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `dp[1]` is equal to `min(dp[1], c[1])`; `dp[2]` is updated to `min(dp[2], c[2])**
