In this case, `max_cost` is assigned the value of \(10^{18}\). The initial state for the other variables (`n`, `L`, and `costs`) remains unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Thus, the output state includes the updated value for `max_cost`, while preserving the conditions for `n`, `L`, and `costs`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `max_cost` is 10^18**.
