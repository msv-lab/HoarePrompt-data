The list `c` is assigned the value of `costs` concatenated with elements equal to `max_cost` until the total length reaches 31. Since `costs` contains `n` integers and `n` can range from 1 to 30, the number of elements added will be `31 - len(costs)`. Thus, the new list `c` will either have `n` values from `costs` followed by a certain number of `max_cost` values. 

The conditions specify:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\)
- `max_cost` is \(10^{18}\)

The resulting state for `c` will depend on the length of `costs`. 

- If `len(costs) = n`, then `c` will contain `n` elements from `costs` followed by \(31 - n\) elements of `10^{18}\).
- If `len(costs) < 31`, then `c` will be exactly `31` elements long.

Thus, the output state considering all these factors is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ `10^9`; `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `10^9`, `max_cost` is `10^18`; `c` is a list of length 31 where the first `n` elements are from `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `10^18`; `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is `10^18`.**
