Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, and `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`. If `L` is greater than or equal to `1 << 29` (which is 536870912), then `L` is reduced by `536870912`. The `answer` is updated to `min(answer, dp[30] + (L > 0) * dp[30])`, and `current_cost` is equal to `dp[30] + dp[29]`.***
