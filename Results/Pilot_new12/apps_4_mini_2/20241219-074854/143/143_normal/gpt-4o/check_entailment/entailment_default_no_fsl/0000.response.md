Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle cases where the necessary amount of lemonade (L liters) is less than any of the available bottle volumes (2^i - 1 liters). Specifically, if there is a bottle volume that exceeds L, the code should still consider the optimal combination of smaller bottles or larger volumes that could more cheaply fulfill the required liters. 

For instance, consider the following test case, which was not explicitly covered in the examples:

Input:
```
3 2
100 200 300
```

According to the problem description, to fulfill a requirement of 2 liters, it can be optimally done by purchasing two 1-liter bottles at a cost of 100 roubles each. However, the provided code, due to its logic and the layer of dynamic programming does not check all the conditions appropriately when L is small compared to the given costs, especially if the largest bottle volume (which is more than L) is cheaper than purchasing smaller bottles.

Therefore, the program might not yield the expected behavior in edge cases where the cheapest combination of bottles is not strictly necessary when they are all larger than L or when not considering combinations intelligently.

Hence, the program is not correct for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion of its incorrectness.
