You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

Input

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and also consider some potential edge cases.

### Problem Understanding
We need to determine the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade, where the available bottles have volumes of \(2^i - 1\) liters and respective costs. The challenge lies in computing the correct combination of bottles to minimally cover the required volume while minimizing the total cost.

### Program Logic Review
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of bottle types and the required volume, along with the costs of each type.
2. **Initialization**: 
    - A `dp` array is defined to store the minimum cost for each bottle size. The size is capped to 31 due to the constraint that \(n \leq 30\).
3. **Cost Calculation**: The program fills the `dp` array to calculate the minimum costs for increasing bottle sizes based on provided costs.
4. **Volume Requirement Handling**: The program iterates through the power values from 30 down to 0, attempting to fulfill the volume requirement while accumulating the cost.

### Identifying Issues
The correctness of this implementation can be tested against potential edge cases:
1. **Minimum inputs**: If `n = 1` and `L = 1` with a cost of 1. The expected output should be 1.
2. **Maximum volume requirement**: If `n = 30` and `L` is quite large (close to \(10^9\)), we need to ensure it correctly calculates costs without an overflow or excessive computation.
3. **Cost with zero volume**: If L = 0, it should return 0 regardless of costs, as no purchasing is needed.

However, the most significant concern arises from the line:
```python
answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
```
This line adds `dp[i]` when there's still a remaining volume \(L\), but does not ensure that this is the minimum cost considering all combinations of choices already made.

### Found Counter-Example
A specific case that highlights potential error:
- If `n = 2`, `L = 3` with costs `costs = [10, 100]`:
  - The optimal choice is to buy three \(1\) liter bottles (which is valid and costs \(30\)), but with incorrect logic in the proposed solution, it might incorrectly evaluate available combinations, leading to failure in procuring the least cost due to how the dp array and costs were calculated.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the implementation and the logic employed, the program may fail to accurately compute the minimum costs for various required quantities, especially in non-trivial cases, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the final decision is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30), a positive integer `L` (where 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and a list of positive integers `costs` containing `n` entries (where each entry is between 1 and 10^9). It calculates the minimum cost to satisfy certain conditions using dynamic programming.

The function initializes a list `dp` with a large maximum cost value at each index from 0 to 30 and populates the first `n` entries of `dp` with the minimum of their previous value or the corresponding entry from `costs`. It then iteratively updates `dp` to represent the minimal cost for all entries by also considering doubling the previous costs. Finally, it computes a cumulative cost in `current_cost` based on the decreasing values of `L`, which represents an amount that can reduce the total cost based on powers of two. 

After executing, the function returns the minimum calculated cost, considering all possible values of `L` that could apply, including cases where `L` is less than necessary for covering some costs, effectively leaving `current_cost` unchanged when `L` is insufficient. Important edge cases such as the handling of maximum values for `L` and costs are implicitly addressed within the dynamic programming approach. The final state includes the minimum cost, represented by `answer`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
