Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem of determining the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade from bottles of `n` different types, where each type has a specific volume and cost.

Here's why the program is correct and satisfies the requirements:

1. **Input Processing**: The program reads the number of bottle types `n`, the required amount of lemonade `L`, and the cost of each bottle type. It processes these inputs correctly, ensuring the data is stored in appropriate types (integers for `n` and `L`, and a list of integers for `costs`).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program initializes a list `dp` to store the minimum cost of bottles for volumes ranging from `0` to `30` (2^30 liters being the maximum possible volume needed) and fills it with a very high value (`max_cost`) to ensure that any valid cost will replace it.

3. **Cost Minimization**: The program iterates over the provided costs and adjusts the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost for purchasing each type of bottle. Then, it ensures that for each volume, it considers the cost of doubling the previous volume, which is key to leveraging the infinite supply of bottles effectively.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The last loop iterates from the highest bottle volume down to 0, checking if it can cover the required `L` liters. If it can, it adds the corresponding bottle's cost to the `current_cost`. If there's any remaining volume needed after selecting the best bottles, it checks if it requires more bottles and adds to the total cost accordingly.

5. **Correct Return Value**: Finally, the program returns the minimum cost calculated, which represents the least amount of roubles required to purchase at least `L` liters of lemonade.

The algorithm effectively combines the principles of dynamic programming with a greedy approach, ensuring that it always finds the minimum cost by assessing the most efficient way to fulfill the quantity requirement with available bottle types. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program meets all criteria.
