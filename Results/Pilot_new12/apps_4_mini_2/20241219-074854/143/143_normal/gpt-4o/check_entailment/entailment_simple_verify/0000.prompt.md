You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and also consider some potential edge cases.

### Problem Understanding
We need to determine the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade, where the available bottles have volumes of \(2^i - 1\) liters and respective costs. The challenge lies in computing the correct combination of bottles to minimally cover the required volume while minimizing the total cost.

### Program Logic Review
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of bottle types and the required volume, along with the costs of each type.
2. **Initialization**: 
    - A `dp` array is defined to store the minimum cost for each bottle size. The size is capped to 31 due to the constraint that \(n \leq 30\).
3. **Cost Calculation**: The program fills the `dp` array to calculate the minimum costs for increasing bottle sizes based on provided costs.
4. **Volume Requirement Handling**: The program iterates through the power values from 30 down to 0, attempting to fulfill the volume requirement while accumulating the cost.

### Identifying Issues
The correctness of this implementation can be tested against potential edge cases:
1. **Minimum inputs**: If `n = 1` and `L = 1` with a cost of 1. The expected output should be 1.
2. **Maximum volume requirement**: If `n = 30` and `L` is quite large (close to \(10^9\)), we need to ensure it correctly calculates costs without an overflow or excessive computation.
3. **Cost with zero volume**: If L = 0, it should return 0 regardless of costs, as no purchasing is needed.

However, the most significant concern arises from the line:
```python
answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
```
This line adds `dp[i]` when there's still a remaining volume \(L\), but does not ensure that this is the minimum cost considering all combinations of choices already made.

### Found Counter-Example
A specific case that highlights potential error:
- If `n = 2`, `L = 3` with costs `costs = [10, 100]`:
  - The optimal choice is to buy three \(1\) liter bottles (which is valid and costs \(30\)), but with incorrect logic in the proposed solution, it might incorrectly evaluate available combinations, leading to failure in procuring the least cost due to how the dp array and costs were calculated.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the implementation and the logic employed, the program may fail to accurately compute the minimum costs for various required quantities, especially in non-trivial cases, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the final decision is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for the first `n` indices, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is `n-1`, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the minimum costs calculated for all indices from 0 to 30, where for each index `i` from 1 to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to the minimum of former `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`; `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `L` is reduced to 0 if the initial value was sufficient to cover costs, `answer` is the minimum cost calculated based on the values in `current_cost`, and `current_cost` contains the sum of appropriate `dp[i]` values based on the power of two representations accommodated by `L`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost calculated based on the values in 'current_cost', which is derived from meaningful minimum costs stored in 'dp' for the necessary indices, and potentially reduced by 'L' if sufficient to cover costs.
