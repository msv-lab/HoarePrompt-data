You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input

Output
30

Input

123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To ascertain whether the provided program meets the stated requirements, we will analyze its logic step by step.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `n` (the number of bottle types) and `L` (the required volume of lemonade in liters).
   - It reads a list of costs corresponding to each bottle type.

2. **Function Logic** (`func_1`):
   - A list `dp` is initialized to represent the minimum cost for each volume of lemonade (from 0 to 30 liters).
   - It fills in minimum costs for the available bottle types.
   - It calculates costs for the power of two bottles, which corresponds to the volume (`1 liter = 2^0 liters, 2 liters = 2^1 liters, ..., 30 liters = 2^30 liters`).
   - The algorithm iterates through possible volumes from the highest (`30 liters`) down to zero, assessing if the current volume weight can be utilized to fulfill the requirement of at least `L` liters.
   - The final output is the minimum cost calculated.

### Problem Description Compliance:
We need to evaluate whether the program correctly computes the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade while considering:
- The constraints on the volumes and their costs as given.
- The fact that any combination of the bottles must yield at least `L` liters.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If `L` is less than the minimum volume available (which is `1 liter`), the program could be expected to handle this.
2. The cost should account for having to go over `L` liters if it means a lesser cost overall.
3. If the cheapest combination is suboptimal in regards to total volume requirements.

### Test Cases:
- Test Case 1:
    ```
    Input:
    1 1
    10
    ```
   - Expected Output: `10`
   - Actual Output: `10`
  
- Test Case 2:
    ```
    Input:
    2 5
    50 80
    ```
   - This can be achieved by either:
     - One bottle of `4 liters (cost 80)` and one `1 liter (cost 50)` → Total cost = 130
     - Two `3 liters (cost 50 each)` to get `6 liters` but it's not reaching total or minimum because two 3LR cannot happen at once → Hence will be fine.
  
### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating multiple scenarios including edge cases, it seems that the program accurately follows the problem description. The logic employed correctly captures the bottle selection rules to minimize cost while ensuring at least `L` liters.

So, based on our thorough analysis, the program is correct and meets the requirements for all conceivable cases provided.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each cost is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the minimum costs from `c` for the first `n` indices, `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[i]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `n` is between 1 and 30, `i` is `n-1`, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the minimum costs calculated for all indices from 0 to 30, where for each index `i` from 1 to 30, `dp[i]` is equal to the minimum of former `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1] * 2`; `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains the original costs from the list `costs`.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list with meaningful minimum costs calculated for indices 0 to 30, `n` is between 1 and 30, `c` contains original costs from the list `costs`, `L` is reduced to 0 if the initial value was sufficient to cover costs, `answer` is the minimum cost calculated based on the values in `current_cost`, and `current_cost` contains the sum of appropriate `dp[i]` values based on the power of two representations accommodated by `L`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum cost calculated based on the values in 'current_cost', which is derived from meaningful minimum costs stored in 'dp' for the necessary indices, and potentially reduced by 'L' if sufficient to cover costs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30), a positive integer `L` (where 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and a list of positive integers `costs` containing `n` entries (where each entry is between 1 and 10^9). It calculates the minimum cost to satisfy certain conditions using dynamic programming.

The function initializes a list `dp` with a large maximum cost value at each index from 0 to 30 and populates the first `n` entries of `dp` with the minimum of their previous value or the corresponding entry from `costs`. It then iteratively updates `dp` to represent the minimal cost for all entries by also considering doubling the previous costs. Finally, it computes a cumulative cost in `current_cost` based on the decreasing values of `L`, which represents an amount that can reduce the total cost based on powers of two. 

After executing, the function returns the minimum calculated cost, considering all possible values of `L` that could apply, including cases where `L` is less than necessary for covering some costs, effectively leaving `current_cost` unchanged when `L` is insufficient. Important edge cases such as the handling of maximum values for `L` and costs are implicitly addressed within the dynamic programming approach. The final state includes the minimum cost, represented by `answer`.
