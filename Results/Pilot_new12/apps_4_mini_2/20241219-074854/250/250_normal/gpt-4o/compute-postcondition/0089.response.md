Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. If `new_marks` is non-empty, it contains one less element than before, indicating prior derived values based on conditions specified, and 1 has been printed. If `new_marks` is empty, `result` contains the values of `x` and `y`, with a length of 2, and the output is the string representation of `x` and `y` joined by a space.***
