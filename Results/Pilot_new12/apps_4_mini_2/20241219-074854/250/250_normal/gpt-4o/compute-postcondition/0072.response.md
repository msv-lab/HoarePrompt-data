Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `y_found` status remains the same; if `x_found` is false and either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`; otherwise, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
