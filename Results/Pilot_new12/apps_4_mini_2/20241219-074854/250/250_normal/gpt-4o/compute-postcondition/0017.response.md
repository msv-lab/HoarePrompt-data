Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 1 more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True.***
