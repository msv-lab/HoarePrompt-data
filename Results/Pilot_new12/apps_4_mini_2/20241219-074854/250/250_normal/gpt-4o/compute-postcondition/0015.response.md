According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `marks` iterable. If there are still more elements in `marks` to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and since we don't know how many iterations have taken place or the exact state of the iteration, we'll assume we are currently processing the last mark available in the iterable.

For the loop to be executed one more time, it is necessary that there exists at least one more element in `marks`, hence `marks` must contain more elements than what has already been processed.

Thus, we adjust the state to reflect that another mark must exist in `marks` to enable another iteration. Since `mark` is the current element being processed, it needs to be the next element in `marks`.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least 1 more mark, `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`, `mark` is the next mark in the iterable**
