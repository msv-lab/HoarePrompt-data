Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `y_found` status remains the same. If `x_found` is false, then if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + x`. Otherwise, if either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - x`. If `x_found` is true, no changes occur to `new_marks`.***
