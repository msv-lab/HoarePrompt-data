The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that was being executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable; `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
