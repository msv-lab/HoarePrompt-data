`marks_set` is assigned the value of a set created from the `marks` list. This means that all the elements in `marks` are added to the set, removing any duplicates. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks_set` is a set created from the unique integers in `marks`.**
