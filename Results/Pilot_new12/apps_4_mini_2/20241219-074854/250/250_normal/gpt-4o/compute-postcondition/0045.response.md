Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. If `x_found` is False and either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. The condition of the if statement is met as one of `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`. `x_found` continues to be False, and `y_found` is not True.***
