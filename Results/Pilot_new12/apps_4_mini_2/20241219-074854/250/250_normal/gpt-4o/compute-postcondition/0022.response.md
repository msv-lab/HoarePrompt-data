According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` iterable. If there is at least one more mark in the iterable beyond the current `mark`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` must contain at least one more mark, and `mark` is the next mark in the iterable. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one additional mark after the current one in `marks`, and `mark` would need to be updated to the next mark in the iterable.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable, `x_found` remains unchanged, and `y_found` remains unchanged**.
