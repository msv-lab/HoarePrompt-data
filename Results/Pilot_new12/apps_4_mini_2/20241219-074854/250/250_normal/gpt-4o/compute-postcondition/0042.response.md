Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. Otherwise, if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`; if neither condition is satisfied, the state of `new_marks`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remains unchanged, with `new_marks` still being an empty set, and `x_found` and `y_found` remaining False.***
