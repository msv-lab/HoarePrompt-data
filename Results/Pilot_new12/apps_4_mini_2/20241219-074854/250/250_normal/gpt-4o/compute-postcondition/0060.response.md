The code snippet provided is:

```
new_marks.add(mark - y)
```

In this code, `new_marks` is a set that adds the value `mark - y` to it. 

Now let's evaluate the impact of this line on the program:

1. `mark` is a positive integer.
2. `y` is a positive integer.
3. The resulting value `mark - y` will be a specific expression, but it may still be positive or not, depending on the values of `mark` and `y`; however, since `mark` is generally defined as a positive integer, the result can be either positive or negative.

Given that there's no direct modification to the already existing values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, and the addition of `mark - y` to `new_marks` suggests that it retains its existing properties (if `new_marks` was already defined as a set before this operation).

So, the output state will consist of the unchanged variables along with the newly added expression:

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, `new_marks` includes the value `mark - y`.**
