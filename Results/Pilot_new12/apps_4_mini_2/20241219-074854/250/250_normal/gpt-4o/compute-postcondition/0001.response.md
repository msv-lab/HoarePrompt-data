The line of code `marks = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a new list to `marks` created by transforming input values into integers. The initial values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are provided through standard input, but the specific values are not defined here.

Since the list `marks` is being created from user input, we only have to account for the change to `marks`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as they were assigned from `input()` previously, and the list `a` remains unchanged aside from no direct relationship with `marks`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of integers created from input values.**
