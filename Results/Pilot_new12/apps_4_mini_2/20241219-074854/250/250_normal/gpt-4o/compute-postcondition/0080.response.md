The code initializes `result` as an empty list. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code, meaning all their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will include `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `new_marks`, and now `result` being an empty list.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `new_marks` is empty; `result` is an empty list**.
