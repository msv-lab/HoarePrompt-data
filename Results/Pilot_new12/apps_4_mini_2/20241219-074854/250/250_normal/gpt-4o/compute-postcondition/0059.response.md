The value of `new_marks` will now include `mark + y`. Since we don't have specific values for `mark`, `y`, or any conditions that impact their existence in `marks_set`, we know that `new_marks` is updated with this new value, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, and `new_marks` now includes the value `mark + y`.**
