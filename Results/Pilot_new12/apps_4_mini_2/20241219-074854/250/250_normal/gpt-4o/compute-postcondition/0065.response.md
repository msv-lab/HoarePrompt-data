The statement `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the `new_marks` set. Since `mark` is taken as the next element in `marks` and both `mark` and `x` are positive integers, the result will also be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element; `marks_set` derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `y_found` status remains the same; `new_marks` now contains the value `mark + x` added to it.**
