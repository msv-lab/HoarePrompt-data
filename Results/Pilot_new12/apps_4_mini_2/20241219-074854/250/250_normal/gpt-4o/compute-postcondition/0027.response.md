The code snippet is a `break` statement, which means it interrupts the execution of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there are no variable assignments or modifications, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State retains all the variable states as defined before the execution of the code, but specifies that the loop was exited.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable; if `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is updated to True and `y_found` is True. We break out of the most internal loop.**
