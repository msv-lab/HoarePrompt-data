The code `result.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `result`. The initial state indicates that `result` is an empty list, so after the execution, `result` will contain the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `new_marks` is empty; `result` contains the value of `x`; the variable `x_found` is false.**
