According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` iterable. If `marks` is a non-empty iterable, the loop will execute at least once, iterating through each mark in the iterable. The states `x_found` and `y_found` (both initialized as False) and `new_marks` (an empty set) indicate no findings have been made yet and no marks have been added.

At the end of the last iteration, the variables `mark` will have taken on the last value in `marks`. At the beginning of the loop, `mark` will be the first element of `marks`. Therefore, the conditions required for the loop to execute are already satisfied since `marks` is non-empty. 

State: **`n` is positive, `l` is positive, `x` is positive, `y` is positive, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is an empty set, `mark` is the first element in `marks`**.
