Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next element in `marks`; `y_found` status remains the same; if `x_found` is false and either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes the value `mark + y`. If `x_found` is false but neither of the above conditions is satisfied and either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - y`. If `x_found` is true, no changes occur to `new_marks`, and if none of the conditions in the else are satisfied, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
