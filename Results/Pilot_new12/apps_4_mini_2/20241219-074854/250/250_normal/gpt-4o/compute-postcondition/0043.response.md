Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. If `x_found` is False and if either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + x`. If not, but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`. If neither condition is met, `new_marks` remains an empty set, and `x_found` and `y_found` continue to be False.***
