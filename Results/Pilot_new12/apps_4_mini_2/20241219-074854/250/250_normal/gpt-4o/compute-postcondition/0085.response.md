The variable `result` is updated by appending the value of `y` to it. Since `y` is a positive integer, the value of `result` will now include this positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes that `result` now contains both its previous values and the new value `y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `new_marks` is empty; if `x_found` is false, `result` contains the value of `x` and the new value `y`. `y_found` is false. `result` now contains `y` as well.**
