Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is modified to include `mark - y` and both `x_found` remains False and `y_found` is not True. Otherwise, if neither condition holds, `new_marks` remains unmodified and continues to contain either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, or an empty set.***
