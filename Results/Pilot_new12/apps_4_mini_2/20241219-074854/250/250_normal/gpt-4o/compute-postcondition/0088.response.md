The code executes a print statement that formats the values in the `result` list into a single string, separating them by a space. The values of `result` are `x` and `y`, which are both positive integers. The `result` list is not modified, and the other variables in the initial state are unaffected by this operation. Thus, the output of the print statement results in a string composed of the string representations of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `new_marks` is empty; `result` now contains `x` and `y`, and the length of `result` is 2; and the output is the string representation of `x` and `y` joined by a space.**
