Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True and `y_found` is set to True. If neither condition is met, `x_found` remains unchanged and `y_found` remains unchanged.***
