The operation `new_marks.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `new_marks` iterable, which is not empty in this context. Consequently, the only affected variable is `new_marks`, which will now have one less element (specifically, it loses the last item from its previous state). The returned value from the `pop()` method is not saved in any variable since it is directly printed.

The other variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, and the state of the `new_marks` before popping remain unchanged aside from `new_marks` having one less item.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `new_marks` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, indicating earlier derived values based on the conditions specified; 1 has been printed.**
