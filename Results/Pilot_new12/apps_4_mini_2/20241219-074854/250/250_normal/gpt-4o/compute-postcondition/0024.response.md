Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable; if `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is updated to True while `y_found` remains unchanged.***
