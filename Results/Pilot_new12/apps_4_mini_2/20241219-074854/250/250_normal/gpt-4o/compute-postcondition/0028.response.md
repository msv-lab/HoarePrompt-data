Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more mark; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `mark` is the next mark in the iterable; if both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
