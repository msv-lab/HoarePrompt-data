Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. If either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains `mark + y`. If that condition is not met, but `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is modified to include `mark - y`, while both `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged. If neither condition holds, `new_marks` remains unmodified and can contain either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, or be an empty set, with `x_found` still being False and `y_found` not True.***
