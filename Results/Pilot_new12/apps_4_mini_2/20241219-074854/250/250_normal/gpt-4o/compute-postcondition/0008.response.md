Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is a set created from the unique integers in `marks`. If either `mark + x` or `mark - x` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is set to True and `y_found` remains False; otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` are unchanged.***
