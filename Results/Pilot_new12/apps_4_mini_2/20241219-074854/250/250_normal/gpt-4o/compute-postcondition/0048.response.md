Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` is derived from `marks`. `x_found` is False, `y_found` is not True, and the current state of `marks_set` includes either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x`. If `new_marks` is modified, it contains either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, or an empty set otherwise.***
