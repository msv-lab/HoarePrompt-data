Postcondition: ***`n` is positive, `l` is positive, `x` is positive, `y` is positive, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is an empty set, `mark` is the first element in `marks`, and at least one of the following holds true: `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`. None of `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` are in `marks_set`.***
