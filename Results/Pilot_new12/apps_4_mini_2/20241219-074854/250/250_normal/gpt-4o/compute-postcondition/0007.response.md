Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is a set created from the unique integers in `marks`, `x_found` is True, `y_found` is False. The current value of `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or the current value of `mark - x` is in `marks_set`.**
