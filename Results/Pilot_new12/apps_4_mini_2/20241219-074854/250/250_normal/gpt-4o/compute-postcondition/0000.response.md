Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] = 0`, `a[n-1] = l`, and the elements of `a` are in strictly increasing order; `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are now assigned the values inputted through `map(int, input().split())`.**
