In the given scenario, `new_marks` will have an updated value as the code snippet modifies it by adding `mark - y`. The current state of `marks_set` includes either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x`.

Since `new_marks` can either contain `mark + x`, `mark - x`, or be an empty set, we need to assess the impact.

1. The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to `new_marks`.
2. The previous state of `new_marks` could either hold `mark + x`, `mark - x`, or be empty.
3. The conditions around `x_found`, `y_found`, `marks`, and `marks_set` are not altered by this operation.

The result of this operation changes the `new_marks` variable by adding `mark - y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, and `marks_set` includes either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x`; `new_marks` is modified to include `mark - y`. `x_found` is False, `y_found` is not True.**
