Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; if both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `x_found` or `y_found` is False, the behavior of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
