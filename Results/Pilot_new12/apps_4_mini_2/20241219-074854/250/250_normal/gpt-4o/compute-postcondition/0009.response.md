Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is a positive integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is a set created from the unique integers in `marks`. If either `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `x_found` remains unchanged, `y_found` is set to True; otherwise, `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
