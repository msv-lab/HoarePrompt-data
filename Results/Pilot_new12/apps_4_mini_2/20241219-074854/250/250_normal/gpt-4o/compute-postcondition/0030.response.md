Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `x_found` is True, indicating that there exists at least one `mark` such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`; `y_found` is True, indicating that there exists at least one `mark` such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.***
