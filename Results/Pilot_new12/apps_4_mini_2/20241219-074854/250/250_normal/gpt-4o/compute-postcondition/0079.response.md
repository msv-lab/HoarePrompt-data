Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is derived from `marks`; `new_marks` is empty; if `x_found` and `y_found` are both True, then `new_marks` remains unchanged; otherwise, new marks can be added based on the combinations of `x` and `y` with the `mark` values in `marks_set`.***
