Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is set to True; otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
