According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `marks` iterable. The loop will iterate through each `mark` in `marks`. At the end of the last iteration, we have the current `mark`, and we need to know that the loop continues until all elements in `marks` have been processed.

Since `marks` is a non-empty iterable and we are currently in the iteration for a specific `mark`, the program will proceed to the next `mark`.

If `marks` has N elements, and this is the current iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop must process `mark`, the next element in `marks` for the iteration. Assuming the iteration starts from 0, if we are currently processing the i-th element, the next `mark` in the list would be at index `i + 1`.

Thus, we can adjust the state to reflect the next `mark` and its position in the iteration.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a non-empty iterable, `marks_set` is derived from `marks`, `mark` is the next mark, and the index is `i + 1`.**
