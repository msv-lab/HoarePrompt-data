The code `new_marks = set()` initializes a new empty set and assigns it to `new_marks`. None of the other variables are affected by this code, as they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers within their specified ranges; `marks` is a non-empty iterable; `marks_set` is a set derived from `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `new_marks` is an empty set.**
