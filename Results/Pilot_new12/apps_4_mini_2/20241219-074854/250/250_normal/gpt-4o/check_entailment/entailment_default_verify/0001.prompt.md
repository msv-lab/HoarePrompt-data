You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```

    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    marks_set = set(marks)
    x_found = False
    y_found = False
    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
            x_found = True
        if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
            y_found = True
        if x_found and y_found:
            break
    if x_found and y_found:
        print(0)
    else:

                if mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - x + y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + x)
                elif mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - x)
            if not y_found:
                if mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + y)
                elif mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - y)
        if new_marks:
            print(1)
            print(new_marks.pop())
        else:
            result = []
            if not x_found:
                result.append(x)
            if not y_found:
                result.append(y)
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether additional marks are needed fails when the values of `x` and `y` are not directly measurable with the given marks.

To illustrate a failing case, consider the following:

Input:
```
4 300 250 270
0 20 290 300
```

Here, the existing marks are `0`, `20`, `290`, and `300`. The program would incorrectly conclude that no new marks are needed, despite the fact that neither `250` nor `270` can be measured with the existing marks.

In detail, the current marks allow us to measure `20` (from `0` to `20`), `290` (from `20` to `290`), and `10` (from `290` to `300`), but cannot measure `250` (there's no pair of existing marks that give `250` as a distance) or `270`. Hence the program should have determined that at least two marks are required (i.e., `250` and `270`).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to a conclusion of **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of marks to determine if there exist certain offsets (x and y) that can be derived from these marks. It verifies whether at least one mark can be modified by adding or subtracting x or y to achieve a valid mark based on specific conditions. The function begins by checking if any marks can be modified using x and y, producing a result that might either confirm successful modifications or return the potential values of x and y as further valid options if no modifications were possible. Ultimately, it outputs either '0', '1', or a count of valid offsets (x, y) that could not be realized based on the current marks. If both x_found and y_found are true, '0' is printed; if new_marks are derived from the existing marks, '1' is printed with the derived mark; if no valid new marks can be generated, it lists the values of x and y that remain valid options. The program handles various cases to ensure it accounts for marks that can reach or fall short of boundaries defined by x and y based on existing marks in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
