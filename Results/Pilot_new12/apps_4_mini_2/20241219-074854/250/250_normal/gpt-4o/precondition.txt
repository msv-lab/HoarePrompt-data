n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; l is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9; x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; a is a list of n integers where each integer represents the distance of a mark from the origin, with a[0] = 0 and a[n-1] = l, and the list is strictly increasing.
