You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the program provided in relation to the given problem description, we need to analyze how well it addresses the requirements.

The requirements state:
1. There should be enough marks on the ruler to measure distances `x` and `y`.
2. The goal is to compute the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both distances.

Now, let's review the program step by step to check for correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads inputs for the number of marks `n`, ruler length `l`, and required distances `x` and `y`, along with the existing marks.

2. **Checking for Required Distances**: Two flags (`need_x` and `need_y`) are used to check whether the distances `x` and `y` can already be measured. It uses a double loop to check all pairs of existing marks.

3. **Adding Missing Marks**: If either distance is not measurable, the distance is added to `additional_marks`. However, the code later attempts to generate new marks by adding existing marks to every new mark, which seems to try to cover potential gaps.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of additional marks needed and the marks themselves.

**Issue with The Code**:
The program might incorrectly add additional marks without properly ensuring that every required distance can be represented. For example, if `x` can be measured but `y` cannot, it might fail to return the correct number of marks required and might also not consider all possible combinations properly.

### Potential Example Where the Program Fails:
Take the input:
```
4 250 185 250
0 20 185 250
```
The correct output should be `0` since we can measure `185` and `250`. However, the program might not be structured correctly to verify gaps in the full extent of what is needed, leading to incorrect assessments where additional marks might still get added erroneously.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not guarantee that all required distances can be isolated correctly without potentially adding missing gaps and could behave unpredictably for certain inputs, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements perfectly.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

If no such pairs exist, `need_x` and `need_y` are False.

Since `need_y` is True and `need_x` is False, if `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains the values of `x` and `y`, implying that both `x` and `y` are included in `additional_marks`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
