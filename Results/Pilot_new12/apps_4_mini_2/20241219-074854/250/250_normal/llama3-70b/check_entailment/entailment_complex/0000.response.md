To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the program in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap
- We need to measure two jump distances `x` and `y` using a ruler with existing marks.
- We need to find out the minimum number of additional marks required on the ruler to measure both distances.
- Original marks on the ruler are given in a list, and the first mark is always at `0` and the last mark is at `l`.

### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads in the necessary integers `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and the set of marks properly.

2. **Difference Calculation**: 
   - The nested loops check all pairs of existing marks to see if there exists a difference equal to `x` or `y`.
   - Two boolean variables `need_x` and `need_y` track if we can measure `x` and `y` respectively.

3. **Assessing Needs**:
   - If `need_x` is False, it adds `x` to `additional_marks`.
   - If `need_y` is False, it adds `y` to `additional_marks`.

4. **Additional Marks Calculation**: 
   - It further computes additional possible marks by adding existing marks to those in `additional_marks`, while ensuring they do not exceed `l` and are not already included in `marks`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of additional marks needed and their values.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic checks all combinations of marks to ensure that the necessary distances `x` and `y` can either be directly measured or can be made measurable by adding marks.
- If both `x` and `y` can be measured with the existing marks, no additional marks are needed.
- If gaps are found (i.e., if either `x` or `y` cannot be measured with existing marks), the program logically adds the required distances to `additional_marks`.
- In the end, the program prints out how many new marks need to be introduced, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion
The program accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem statement, finds if additional marks are necessary, and provides the count of these marks correctly.

Therefore, the assessment of correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
