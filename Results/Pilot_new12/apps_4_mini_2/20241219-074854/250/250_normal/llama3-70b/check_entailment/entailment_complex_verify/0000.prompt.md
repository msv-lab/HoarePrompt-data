You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the code and consider edge cases that might not be handled properly.

The program aims to determine if additional marks are needed on a ruler to measure two specified distances, `x` and `y`, given an array of existing marks. 

Here’s a breakdown of the key sections of the code:

1. It reads the input values and initializes a set of existing marks.
2. It uses two flags, `need_x` and `need_y`, to track whether the distances can be measured using the current marks.
3. It checks all combinations of marks to see if they can measure exactly `x` or `y`.
4. If the distances cannot be measured (`need_x` or `need_y` are `False`), it adds those distances to a list of additional marks.
5. It attempts to generate additional marks by checking if combining existing marks can cover the required distances.

Now we'll evaluate the program's correctness:

### Potential Issue:
1. **Zero as a Valid Output**: The marks currently exist in the set, so if `x` or `y` are already in the set, the algorithm fails to account for marking the distances directly.
2. **Repeated Marks**: The result list of `additional_marks` can include duplicates because of the condition for generating new marks (from the sum of existing and newly added marks) not being handled properly, leading to repeated values in the output.
3. **Measuring Example Case**: If the input is:
   ```
   3 250 185 230
   0 250 250
   ```
   Here, `y` cannot be measured with existing marks, but the program may incorrectly suggest more marks than necessary because it might look for `additive` marks that are unnecessary.

4. **Output Format**: The problem states to add the minimum required marks, but if the code does not account for when both `x` and `y` are not present (in the case where they need to be separately achieved), it may return an incorrect additional mark count.

### Conclusion:
Given these insights, I see that there can be scenarios where the output does not adhere strictly to the problem's conditions, especially around handling existing distances correctly.

Therefore, based on these evaluations:

Correctness: **False**. 

This assessment is made because there are evident states where the program logic can produce incorrect results or outputs that do not meet the specifications of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers; `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices `i`, `j` (where 0 ≤ `i` < `j` < `n`) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices `i`, `j` (where 0 ≤ `i` < `j` < `n`) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`. If no such pairs exist, `need_x` and `need_y` are False.
    additional_marks = []
    if (not need_x) :
        additional_marks.append(x)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers, `need_x` is False and `need_y` is True, thus `additional_marks` contains the value of `x`.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers such that (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`). Since `need_y` is True and `need_x` is False, if `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains the values of `x` and `y`, implying that both `x` and `y` are included in `additional_marks`.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `additional_marks` contains all values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and all previously calculated sums of the form `i + j`.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` reads input parameters `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with a set of `marks`. It determines if there are pairs in `marks` whose differences equal to `x` and `y`. If no such pairs exist, `x` and/or `y` are added to the list `additional_marks`. The function then computes additional values by adding each `mark` with the values from `additional_marks`, appending results to `additional_marks` if they are less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. Finally, the function outputs the count and list of distinct values in `additional_marks`. 

The function is fundamentally about finding gaps in a sequence defined by `marks` regarding the specified distances `x` and `y`, and fills those gaps while enforcing the upper limit set by `l`. It should be noted that the input list `a` is not directly used in the computation or returned results, which represents missing functionality in utilizing this list as intended by the parameters. Furthermore, if either `x` or `y` were to exceed `l` on input or if all possible combinations exceed `l`, adjustments in logic might be warranted, even though this is not reflected in the current implementation.

Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
