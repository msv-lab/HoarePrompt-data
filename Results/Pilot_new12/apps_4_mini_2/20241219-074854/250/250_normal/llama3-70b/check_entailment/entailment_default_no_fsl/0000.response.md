Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that make it incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

1. **Missing Initial Validation**: The program does not check if `x` or `y` is already present in the marks list before attempting to check for their differences. For instance, if both `x` and `y` were to be found directly in the marks, the output should reflect that no additional marks are required yet this could be skipped erroneously.

2. **Handling of Additional Marks**: The program attempts to add `x` and `y` to `additional_marks` if needed but does not handle cases where either might already be valid due to existing marks combinations. In certain scenarios, measures could be available from bad combinations of existing marks, which needs to be verified.

3. **Redundant Additions**: The logic used to try and compute new possible marks by adding existing ones to elements in `additional_marks` could lead to redundant entries that are already included in `marks`. 

4. **Upper Bound on Marks**: Although the implementation respects the upper limit of `l`, there are no checks to prevent invalid scenarios like trying to add marks greater than `l` where both `x` and `y` could lie entirely outside due to invalid input configurations.

**Test Case Example**:
Consider input:
```
2 300 100 200
0 300
```
According to the problem, there's a need for both marks since no distances can be measured. However, in this example, the program would end up adding `100` and `200` as needed and return an unnecessary value since the function logic might not properly establish the necessity of these marks and their connectivity to existing measures.

Due to these errors and potential oversights, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, concluding that Correctness is indeed False.
