Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers; `need_x` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices `i`, `j` (where 0 ≤ `i` < `j` < `n`) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one pair of indices `i`, `j` (where 0 ≤ `i` < `j` < `n`) such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`. If no such pairs exist, `need_x` and `need_y` are False.**
