To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we start by considering the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop itself.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is an iterable that must include at least `x` and `y`.

The loop's code checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l` and if this sum is not in the `marks` iterable. If both conditions are satisfied, it adds `i + j` to the `additional_marks`. 

Since `additional_marks` starts as empty, it will only accumulate values if the conditions are met. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are values in `additional_marks` that can provide valid `j` values.

Given the constraints, let's analyze the conditions after all iterations of the loop:

1. If the loop has executed at all, it means there was at least one valid `j` such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. Hence, `additional_marks` will contain values of the form `i + j` that satisfy these conditions.

2. If the loop finishes execution without any iterations (i.e., if no `j` satisfied the condition), `additional_marks` remains empty.

3. After all iterations, `marks` still contains at least `x` and `y`, and any elements added to `additional_marks` will be strictly less than or equal to `l` (unless `i` is such that all values lead to sums greater than `l` or are already present in `marks`).

4. The final state must reflect every possible state of `additional_marks` based on the iterated conditions, noting that `additional_marks` has been generated based on valid sums involving `i`.

Therefore, the final output must encapsulate the possible state of `additional_marks`, the conditions on `marks`, and the bounds for `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **If at least one value was added, `additional_marks` will contain values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is not in `marks` and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`. `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`. If no value was added, `additional_marks` remains empty.**
