`need_y` is assigned the value `True`, but the other variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are still valid and not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `need_y` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `need_y` is True**
