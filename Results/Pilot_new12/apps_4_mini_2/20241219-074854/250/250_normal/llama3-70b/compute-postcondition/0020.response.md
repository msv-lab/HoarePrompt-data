Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers; `marks` is a set of unique integers; if the difference between `marks[2]` and `marks[0]` equals `y`, then `i` remains 0, `j` remains 2, `need_x` is True, and `need_y` is True. If the difference does not equal `y`, there are no additional changes to `i`, `j`, `need_x`, or `need_y`.***
