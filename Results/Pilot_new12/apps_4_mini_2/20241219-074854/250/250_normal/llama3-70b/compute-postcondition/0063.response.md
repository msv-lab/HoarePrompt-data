The value `x` is appended to the `additional_marks` list, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `additional_marks` changes from an empty list to a list containing the value of `x`. `need_x` and `need_y` remain as described in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True, `additional_marks` is a list containing the value of `x`.**
