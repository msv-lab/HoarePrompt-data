The impact of the code sets `need_y` to `True`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, with the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` being equal to `y`. No other variables are directly impacted by this code execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_y` is True, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y**.
