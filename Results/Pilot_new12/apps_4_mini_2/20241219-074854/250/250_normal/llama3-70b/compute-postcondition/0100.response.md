According to the code, the loop iterates over the `additional_marks`, so it will execute again for each element in the `additional_marks` list. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in that list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition is that `additional_marks` must contain at least 3 elements (to have a third one for j), making `j` the third element in `additional_marks`. Therefore, the next state would be when `j` is updated to the third element. The status of `marks` and the variable `i` remain unchanged for this context since they are not modified directly by the loop itself.

State: **`additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements, `marks` contains element `i` as the fourth element, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`**
