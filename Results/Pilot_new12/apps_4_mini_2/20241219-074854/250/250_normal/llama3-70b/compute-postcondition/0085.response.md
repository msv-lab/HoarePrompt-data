According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, the loop executes again for the next element in `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least one value, and `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element. 

Since `j` will take the next value from `additional_marks`, we need to establish what the next state will be for the loop to execute one more time. Given that `i` is the next element in `marks`, we do not need to change `i`, as it remains as is. 

However, for the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more value beyond the current one being processed (which can be determined by its current length), indicating that a next iteration is possible.

State: **`additional_marks` contains at least two values, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `i` remains the next element in `marks`, `j` is set to the next element in `additional_marks`**
