Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, `additional_marks` is an iterable containing at least one element, the current values of `i` and `j` satisfy the condition that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not present in `marks`.***
