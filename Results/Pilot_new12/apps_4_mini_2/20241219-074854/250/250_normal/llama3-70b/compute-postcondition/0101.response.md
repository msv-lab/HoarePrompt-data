The value of `additional_marks` is updated by appending the sum of `i` (which is the fourth element in `marks`) and `j` (which is the third element in `additional_marks`). The states of the other variables remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements (now will include an additional element which is the value of `i + j`), `marks` contains element `i` as the fourth element, and `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` contains at least 3 elements (now including `i + j`), `marks` contains element `i` as the fourth element, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`.**
