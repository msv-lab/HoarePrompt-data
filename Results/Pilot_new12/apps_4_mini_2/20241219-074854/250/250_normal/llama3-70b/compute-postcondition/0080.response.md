According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `marks` and its contents. The loop will iterate over each value in `marks`. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`. If `marks` has at least 2 elements, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `marks`. 

Since `marks` has at least two elements (including `x` and `y`), for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to represent the next mark in the list. If the current `i` is the last element in `marks`, there will be no next iteration.

Thus, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to the next element in `marks`, and we assume `marks` will have one more element after `y`.

State: **`additional_marks` contains values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is not in `marks` and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks`**
