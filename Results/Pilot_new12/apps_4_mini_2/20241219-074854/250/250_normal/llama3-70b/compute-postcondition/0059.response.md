Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` for `j` in range from 1 to `n-1` such that `marks[j] - marks[1]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` for `j` in range from 1 to `n-1` such that `marks[j] - marks[1]` equals `y`. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `need_x` and `need_y` will remain as initially defined.**
