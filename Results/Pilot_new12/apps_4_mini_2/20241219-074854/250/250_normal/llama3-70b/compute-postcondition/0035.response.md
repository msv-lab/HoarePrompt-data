According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`, and the loop is set to start at `i`. Since `i` has been incremented by 1 (as stated), `i` is now the value of `i + 1`, and we can denote this as `i'`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, we need `j` to be the value of `i'` in the next iteration. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` starts from `i` and is now incremented by 1, `j` becomes equal to `i'` which is equal to the previous `i + 1`.

Letâ€™s denote `i' = i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j`, which corresponds to `n` being greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`**
