Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`, `i`, and `j` are defined, where `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), and `marks` is a set of unique integers. If the difference between the element at index `j` (which is `n-1`) and the element at index `i` (which is 1) of `marks` is equal to `x`, the condition holds true. If the condition does not hold true, there is no action taken, but the preconditions are still maintained.***
