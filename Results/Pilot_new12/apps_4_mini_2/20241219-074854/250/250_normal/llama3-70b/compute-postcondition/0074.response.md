To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we start by examining the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5)
- `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9)
- `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`)
- `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`
- `additional_marks` must still contain more elements which are less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`

The code snippet is:
```
additional_marks.append(i + j)
```
This line of code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the list `additional_marks`. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the precondition, but we know that `i + j` is some integer that could potentially be less than or equal to `l`, assuming `i` and `j` are positive integers. The essential detail here is that `i + j` should also not equal any number already present in `marks`.

Since this line alters `additional_marks` by adding a new element, we state that `additional_marks` has been changed, but we maintain the preconditions for the other variables, which remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, and `additional_marks` now also includes `i + j`.**
