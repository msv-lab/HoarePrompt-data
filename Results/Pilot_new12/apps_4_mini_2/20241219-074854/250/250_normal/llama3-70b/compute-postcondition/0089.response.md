The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since `j` is defined to be the fourth value in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains at least four values, `j` can be referenced directly as an element of that list. Therefore, the impact of the code includes the new value being added to `additional_marks`.

The other variables, `marks` and the specific values of `i`, do not affect `additional_marks` directly, but we are primarily focusing on the state of `additional_marks` itself.

Output State: **`additional_marks` now contains at least five values, including `i + j` as the new element added to it; `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element; `j` is the fourth value in `additional_marks`.**
