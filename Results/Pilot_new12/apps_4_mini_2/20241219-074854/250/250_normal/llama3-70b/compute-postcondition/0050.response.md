The variable `need_x` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The conditions of variable `n` (greater than 1), along with the values of `i` and `j`, still hold true after the code has been executed. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True**
