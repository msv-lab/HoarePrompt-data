Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True, `i` is 1, `j` will be `n-1`, and the difference between the element at index `j` and the element at index `i` of `marks` is equal to `x`.***
