According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the initial value of `i`. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 100,000 and `i` is initialized to 0, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. 

Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can indeed execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will take values starting from `i` (which is 0) and will increase until `j` reaches `n-1`. 

Thus, for the loop to start executing, the relevant states do not need any adjustment for `n` and `i`, as they already satisfy the conditions for execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers input by the user, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
