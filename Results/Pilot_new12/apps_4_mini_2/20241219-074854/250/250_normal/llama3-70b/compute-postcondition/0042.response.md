According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts executing from `i` (which is initialized to 1) and goes up to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i < n` must hold true, which translates to `1 < n`. 

Additionally, `j` is the loop variable that takes on the values starting from `i` up to `n - 1`. When the loop starts, `j` will initially be 1 (the value of `i`). There are additional variables `need_x` and `need_y`, but they do not directly impact whether the loop can execute. However, their definitions suggest that they pertain to some conditions based on the `marks` array, which could be relevant during the loop's execution.

Thus, the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute are that `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop body can execute at least once, and `j` should start at 1 since `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
