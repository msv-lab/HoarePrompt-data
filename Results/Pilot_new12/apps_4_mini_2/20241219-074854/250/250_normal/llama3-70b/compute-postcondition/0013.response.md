Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `marks` is a set of unique integers. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, then the specified condition holds true, and the program will proceed with the necessary logic related to this case. The values of `i`, `j`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain unchanged, with `i` as 0 and `j` as 1, while `need_x` and `need_y` are still set to True.**
