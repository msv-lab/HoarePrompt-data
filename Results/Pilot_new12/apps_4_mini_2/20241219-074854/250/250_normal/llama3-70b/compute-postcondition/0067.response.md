Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers such that (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`). Since `need_y` is True and `need_x` is False, if `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains the values of `x` and `y`, implying that both `x` and `y` are included in `additional_marks`.***
