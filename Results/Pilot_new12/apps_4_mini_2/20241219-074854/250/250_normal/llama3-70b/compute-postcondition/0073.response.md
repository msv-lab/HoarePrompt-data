According to the code, the loop iterates over the `additional_marks`. In order for it to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one value left in `additional_marks` after the last iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, `n` is between 2 and 10^5, and `l` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9. The values of `i` and `j` must satisfy the condition that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. 

Since we don’t have information about the state of `additional_marks` at the end of the last iteration, let’s assume it had some values that met those criteria, and then one of those values was processed. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one valid `i + j` left in `additional_marks`, meaning `additional_marks` must still contain values that are not in `marks` and adhere to the conditions.

Additionally, since `j` iterates over `additional_marks`, after processing one value, the next value of `j` must be available.

Therefore, with these considerations:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, and `additional_marks` must still contain more elements which are less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`.**
