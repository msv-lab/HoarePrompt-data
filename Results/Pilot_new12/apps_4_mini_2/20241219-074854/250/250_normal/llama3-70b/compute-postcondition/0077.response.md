The code snippet appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. The initial state specifies that both `i` and `j` must be defined and available. Since `j` is said to be the next value from `additional_marks`, it suggests that it already has a value that is relevant.

After the appending operation, the state of the variable `additional_marks` will include one more value, specifically the result of `i + j`. The other variables retain their original properties since they are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, `additional_marks` now includes at least one more value equal to `i + j`, and `j` is the next value from `additional_marks`.**
