According to the code, the loop executes `n` times, which is determined by the integer `n`. Since `n` is already a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), it ensures that the loop will run at least twice.

The states for the loop to execute do not require any modifications regarding `n` because it's guaranteed to be in the range that allows the loop to execute. However, since everything else functions within the loop, we need to focus on the state of the indices and variables linked with the loop.

For the iterations, the variable `i` will start at 0 and iterate up to n-1. Therefore, we can specify the initial state of `i` just before the loop starts.

Considering the conditions around `need_x` and `need_y`, without specific indications in the loop statement, they do not affect the loop's ability to execute. They can remain as is to indicate that their states are still False before the loop starts.

Thus, the adjustments for the loop execution are minimal, primarily focusing on `i`:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers input by the user, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0**
