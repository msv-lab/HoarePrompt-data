The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Given the initial state, we know that `i + j` is valid for this operation since it is less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`.

After executing the code, `additional_marks` will contain `i + j` as a new element. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`additional_marks` now contains `i + j` as an additional element, `i` is the fourth element in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, the current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not present in `marks`.**
