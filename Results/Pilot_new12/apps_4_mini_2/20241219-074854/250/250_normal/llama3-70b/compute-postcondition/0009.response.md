Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers input by the user, `need_x` is set to True, `need_y` is True, and both `i` and `j` remain 0. The current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`.**
