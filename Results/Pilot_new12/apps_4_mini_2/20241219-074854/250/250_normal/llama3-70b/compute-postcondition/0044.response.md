The code assigns `True` to `need_x`. The variable `need_x` is now a boolean value that indicates a requirement or condition but does not affect the values of other variables. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `marks` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, and `need_x` is True.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, and `need_x` is True.**
