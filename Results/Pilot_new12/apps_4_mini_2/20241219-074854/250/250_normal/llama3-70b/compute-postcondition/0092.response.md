According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `marks` list. If `marks` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next item in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, which implies it has at least 3 elements. The variable `i` is currently the next element in `marks`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in `marks`, and for `additional_marks`, we need to ensure that `i` is a valid element (not the last one).

Since `i` is the next element in `marks`, it will increment to the subsequent element. Thus, if `marks` contains at least 4 elements, the loop can execute one more time for the fourth element, which can be represented as `i` moving to the next element after its current state.

State: **`additional_marks` contains all values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks`, which is the fourth element in `marks`**.
