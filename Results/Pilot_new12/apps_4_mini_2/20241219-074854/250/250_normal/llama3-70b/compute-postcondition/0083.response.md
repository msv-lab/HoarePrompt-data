The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. We know that the current value of `i` plus `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and that the resulting value `i + j` is not already in the `marks` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, we can conclude:

Output State: **`additional_marks` contains at least one value, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`**.
