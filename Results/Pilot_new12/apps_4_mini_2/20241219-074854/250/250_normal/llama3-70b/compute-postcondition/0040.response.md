Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks` are defined; `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `i` remains constant at its initial value, `j` is `n-1`. If the loop does not execute, then `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial values, and `j` does not change from its original condition.**
