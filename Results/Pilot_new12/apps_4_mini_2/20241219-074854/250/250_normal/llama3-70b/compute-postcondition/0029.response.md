Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_y`, `i`, and `j` are defined, where `marks` is a set of unique integers. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`, then `need_y` is set to True. If the condition does not hold true, the preconditions remain maintained, and no changes are made.***
