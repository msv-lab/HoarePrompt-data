Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is True, thus `additional_marks` contains the value of `x`. The value of `need_y` is False after entering the if condition.***
