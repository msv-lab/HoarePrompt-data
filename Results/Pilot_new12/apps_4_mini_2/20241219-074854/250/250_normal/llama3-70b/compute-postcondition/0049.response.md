According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is set to run for `j` starting from `i` (which is 1) up to `n` (where `n` is greater than 1). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Given that `n` is greater than 1, this means `j` can take the value of 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` must be 2, and since there are no constraints on `need_y` or other variables related to this increment, they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
