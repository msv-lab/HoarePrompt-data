According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. The loop iterates over each element in `additional_marks`. Since the end of the last iteration is reached, `j` represents the first element in `additional_marks`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` needs to have at least one more element after the current `j`. The current `i` is the fourth element in `marks`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. 

If `additional_marks` contains more elements, `j` will need to refer to the next element (the second element) in the list upon the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, `marks` contains element `i` as the fourth element, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.**
