The Python code snippet executes a `print` statement that outputs the length of the `additional_marks` collection. The initial state indicates that `additional_marks` contains all values of the form `i + j` such that the sum is less than or equal to `l` and is not included in `marks`. Given that `marks` contains at least `x`, `y`, and previously calculated sums, the length of `additional_marks` will simply reflect the count of these valid sums.

The state of `additional_marks` remains unchanged in terms of its contents, but the impact of the code is the output of its length.

Output State: **`additional_marks` contains all values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and all previously calculated sums of the form `i + j`; the length of `additional_marks` has been printed.**
