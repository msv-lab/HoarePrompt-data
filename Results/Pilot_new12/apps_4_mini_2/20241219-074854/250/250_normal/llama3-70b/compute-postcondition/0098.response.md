The code snippet appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. The values of `i` and `j` are referenced but not specified. The state of `marks` indicates that `i` is the fourth element. The variable `j` is established as the second element in `additional_marks`. Therefore, if `additional_marks` contains at least two elements, `j` is defined, and we can consider `i` from the context.

After executing the code, `i + j` will be added to the `additional_marks` list. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State can be described as follows:

Output State: **`additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, `marks` contains element `i` as the fourth element, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now includes `i + j` as an additional element.**
