The value of `i` is the next element in `marks`, and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` already contains at least two values, it will now contain one more element, which is the sum of `i` and `j`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `additional_marks` contains at least three values now, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and a new element `i + j` has been added to `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` contains at least three values now, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element; `i` is the next element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, and a new element `i + j` has been added to `additional_marks`.**
