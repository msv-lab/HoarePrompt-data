Functionality: **The function `func()` reads input parameters `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with a set of `marks`. It determines if there are pairs in `marks` whose differences equal to `x` and `y`. If no such pairs exist, `x` and/or `y` are added to the list `additional_marks`. The function then computes additional values by adding each `mark` with the values from `additional_marks`, appending results to `additional_marks` if they are less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`. Finally, the function outputs the count and list of distinct values in `additional_marks`. 

The function is fundamentally about finding gaps in a sequence defined by `marks` regarding the specified distances `x` and `y`, and fills those gaps while enforcing the upper limit set by `l`. It should be noted that the input list `a` is not directly used in the computation or returned results, which represents missing functionality in utilizing this list as intended by the parameters. Furthermore, if either `x` or `y` were to exceed `l` on input or if all possible combinations exceed `l`, adjustments in logic might be warranted, even though this is not reflected in the current implementation.**
