According to the code snippet provided, the for loop will execute over the variable `additional_marks`. For the loop to run, `additional_marks` must be an iterable with at least one element.

Considering the preconditions given:
- `n` is a positive integer, but it does not directly affect the loop execution.
- `l` is a positive integer, but it also does not directly affect the loop execution.
- `x` and `y` are defined such that they must be within the range (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`).
- The `marks` iterable must include at least the values `x` and `y`.

A key point here is that we do not know the state of `additional_marks` before the loop. To ensure the loop can execute, we must assume at least one element is present in `additional_marks`, as this is a direct requirement for the loop to run.

Thus, we need to include that `additional_marks` is indeed an iterable with at least one item before the loop starts. Therefore, we adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` must include at least `x` and `y`, `additional_marks` must be an iterable containing at least one element**
