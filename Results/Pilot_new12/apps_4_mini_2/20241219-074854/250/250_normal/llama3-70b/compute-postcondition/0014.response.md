In the given code, `need_y` is reassigned the value of `True`. Since `need_y` is already set to `True`, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`) also remain unchanged as there are no alterations made to them in the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, `marks` is a set of unique integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True.**
