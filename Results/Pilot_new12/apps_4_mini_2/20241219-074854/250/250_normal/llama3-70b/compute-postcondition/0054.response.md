According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, it does not put any constraints on `j` being able to execute again. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, meaning we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3 (given that `j` will be incremented to 3).

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
