Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`, `i`, and `j` are defined, where `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), and `marks` is a set of unique integers. The current value of `j` is `n-1`, and the current value of `i` is `1`. The difference between the element at index `j` of `marks` and the element at index `i` of `marks` is equal to `y`.***
