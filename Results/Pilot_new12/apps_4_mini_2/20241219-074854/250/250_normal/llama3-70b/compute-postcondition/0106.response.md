The given code transforms the contents of `additional_marks` into a string representation that joins each integer value into a single space-separated string. The previous content of `additional_marks` remains unchanged, but the specific output is being printed.

Since `print()` function does not change the state of `additional_marks`, the output state will reflect that `additional_marks` contains all values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, but now we include the fact that the length of `additional_marks` was printed as a string.

Output State: **`additional_marks` contains all values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`; the length of `additional_marks` has been printed.**
