The code appends the value of `y` to the list `additional_marks`. The variable `additional_marks` previously contained the value of `x`, and after this operation, it will now also contain `y`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. However, `need_y` was False before entering the if condition and is stated to be False afterward as well, which indicates that the conditions for changing this variable have not been met. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `additional_marks` contains the values of `x` and `y`.**
