According to the code, the execution of the loop is determined by the `additional_marks` collection. For the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must contain at least one more value. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `additional_marks` includes values that result from the condition where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not in `marks`. 

We need to know the previous value of `j` and the current setup of `additional_marks`. Assuming there was a last value of `j` from `additional_marks`, we can infer that:
1. If `j` was the last value used in the loop, the next `j` will be a subsequent value of `additional_marks`.
2. To determine how many items are left for the loop to iterate upon, the `additional_marks` must have at least one more mark available.
3. If `additional_marks` has no more values left after the last iteration, the loop cannot continue.

For `j` to adjust appropriately for the next iteration, we can assume that it simply increments based on the previously processed `additional_marks`. Given that `additional_marks` inherently includes values up to `l`, there should be a guaranteed range of workable values we can calculate.

Assuming `j` was the last items in `additional_marks`, the next state must take into account one more element in `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), and `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, `additional_marks` must also include at least one more value, and `j` is the next value from `additional_marks`.**
