To determine the necessary adjustments for the for loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop.

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 10^5].
- `l` is a positive integer in the range [2, 10^9].
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`).
- `need_y` is True, meaning that `y` must be included from `additional_marks`.
- `need_x` is False, meaning that `x` may not be required.

The loop is intended to iterate over `marks`. For the loop to execute, the `marks` collection must be non-empty.

Given that `additional_marks` contains `x` and `y`, this suggests it is a list or collection of elements that should include both `x` and `y`.

To ensure that the loop will execute, we need to confirm that `marks` is indeed defined and contains elements. In this scenario, `marks` may be derived from `additional_marks`, and since both `x` and `y` are included within `additional_marks`, `marks` should have at least those values to guarantee at least one iteration.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

1. `marks` should not be an empty collection.
2. `marks` may be adjusted to include at least `x` and `y`.

Consequently, the adjustments lead to the following statement about the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers such that (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is an iterable that must include at least `x` and `y`**.
