According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. If the list has more values, the loop will iterate over them. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least three values, meaning it can contain at least four values for the loop to run one more time. The variable `j` will take the value of the next element in the `additional_marks` list. 

Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least four values. Accordingly, `j` needs to be updated to reflect the next value in the iteration, which will be the fourth element. 

State: **`additional_marks` contains at least four values, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `j` is the fourth value in `additional_marks`**
