The values of `need_x` and `need_y` are directly assigned to `False` as per the provided code. The previous values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` remain unchanged, as they are unaffected by the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers input by the user (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`); `marks` is a set of unique integers input by the user; `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False.**
