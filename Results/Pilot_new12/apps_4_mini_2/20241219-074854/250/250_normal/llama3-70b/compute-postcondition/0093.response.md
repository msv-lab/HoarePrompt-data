According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element. Given the description, `additional_marks` is derived from values of the form `i + j` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and those values are not already in `marks`. 

Since `i` is the next element in `marks`, which is the fourth element, it implies that there are already three elements present in `marks`. Thus, we must ensure that `i + j` produces valid results that meet the conditions specified for `additional_marks`.

For the loop to be executed, we need the following conditions:
1. The value of `additional_marks` must contain at least one element.
2. `j` should be the first element in `additional_marks`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, `i` is the fourth element in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`**
