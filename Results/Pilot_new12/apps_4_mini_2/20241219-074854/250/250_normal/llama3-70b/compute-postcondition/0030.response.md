According to the code, the ability of the loop to execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. The loop starts with `j` set to `i` and continues iterating while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Given that `j` is currently at `i`, and with the condition that it can increment and potentially be a new value for the next iteration:
- If the loop is to execute one more time, `j` needs to increase by 1.
- Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `j` will now be `i + 1`.

Thus, to properly depict the state necessary for the next iteration, we must ensure that `j` is equal to `i + 1`, while `j` must also be less than `n`.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_y`, `i`, and `j` is `i + 1`, where `j` must be less than `n`**
