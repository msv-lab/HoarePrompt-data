The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i`, and `j` fulfill the condition that `j` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 1; `need_y` is now True.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i`, and `j` fulfill the condition that `j` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 1; `need_y` is True.**
