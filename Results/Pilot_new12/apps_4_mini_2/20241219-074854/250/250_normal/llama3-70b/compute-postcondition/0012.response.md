The statement `need_x = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_x`. The previous value of `need_x` was already `True`, so there is no change to its state. The values of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers input by the user, `i` remains 0, `j` is 1, `need_x` is True, `need_y` is set to True.**
