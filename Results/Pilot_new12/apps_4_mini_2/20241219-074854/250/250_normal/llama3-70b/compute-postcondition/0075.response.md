Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), and `marks` includes at least `x` and `y`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` also includes `i + j`.***
