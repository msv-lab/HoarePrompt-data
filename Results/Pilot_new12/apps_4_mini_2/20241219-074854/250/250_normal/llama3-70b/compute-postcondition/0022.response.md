According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined by `range(n)`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 100,000. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, which is still true as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5), `l` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9), `x` and `y` are positive integers (1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), `marks` is a set of unique integers; `need_x` is True if there exists `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0]` equals `x`, `need_y` is True if there exists `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[0]` equals `y`, `i` is 1, `j` is n-1**
