`marks` is assigned a set containing integers, where the integers are derived from a user input that is split and mapped to an integer type. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain as positive integers input by the user, within their specified constraints. The state of `marks` now contains distinct integers provided by the user. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers input by the user (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`), and `marks` is a set of unique integers input by the user.**
