To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state before the loop starts. The key components to note are `additional_marks`, which must contain values, and the variable `j` that will iterate over `additional_marks`.

1. `additional_marks` must contain at least one value for the loop to execute. 
2. Each value in `additional_marks` is of the form `i + j`, where the condition is that `i + j` is not present in `marks` and `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l`. 
3. For `j` to have a value in `additional_marks`, we need to ensure that there exists a corresponding value derived from `i` (the next element in `marks`).
4. The current value of `i` is defined as the next element in `marks`.

Taking into consideration the constraints provided, we can outline the necessary state adjustments:

- There must be at least one value in `additional_marks` for the loop to start executing.
- Since `i` is the next element in `marks`, we need to ensure that `i` is defined and exists in `marks`.
- Since we need `j` from `additional_marks`, we should validate that at least one `j` satisfies the condition that `i + j` is not in `marks` and that it is less than or equal to `l`.

State: **`additional_marks` must contain at least one value, `marks` includes at least `x`, `y`, and one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks**
