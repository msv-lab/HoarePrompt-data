#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), f is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products and clients for each of the n days.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` contains exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the values calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of the elements in the regular_sales list along with the first f elements from the sorted potential_sales_increase list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), a non-negative integer `f` (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and a list `days` containing exactly `n` tuples. Each tuple consists of two integers representing the number of products `k_i` and clients `l_i` for each day. The function computes the `regular_sales` as the smaller value of `k_i` or `l_i` for each day's tuple, and calculates `potential_sales_increase` by determining how much more could be sold beyond the regular sales, given the condition of `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)`. The total sales returned is the sum of all regular sales combined with the largest `f` values from the sorted potential sales increases. If `f` is greater than the number of valid potential increases computed, the function safely handles it by only summing the available amounts. The function ensures that it operates correctly given the constraints and expected format of the parameters. In summary, it returns the total cumulative sales possible based on the provided constraints of regular and potential sales increase, and handles edge cases such as when the sales may not reach the desired increase due to limits in `k` and `l`.
