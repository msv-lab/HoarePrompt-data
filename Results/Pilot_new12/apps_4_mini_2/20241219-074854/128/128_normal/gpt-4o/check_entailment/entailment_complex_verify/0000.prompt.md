You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation to identify any potential edge cases or situations where the program may not perform as expected.

### Problem Description Summary:
- For `n` days, each day has `k_i` products and `l_i` clients.
- If clients come on a day with enough products, they buy them up to the number of clients (`l_i`).
- If Noora chooses `f` days for a sell-out, each chosen day will have its products doubled (`2 * k_i`).
- The goal is to maximize the total number of sold products.

### Key Logic in the Program:
1. **Regular Sales Calculation**: The regular sales for each day is the minimum of available products and clients (`min(k, l)`).
2. **Potential Sales Increase Calculation**: This is calculated as the difference between doubling the products and the regular sales, capped at the client count (`min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`).
3. **Total Sales Calculation**: The program sums up the regular sales and the best `f` increases from the potential sales increase calculations.

### Edge Cases:
1. **No Clients**: If `l_i` is 0 for all days, it doesn't matter how many products are available; sales will always be 0.
2. **Maximum Clients with Zero Products**: If `k_i` is 0 but `l_i` is greater than 0, the sales will also be 0, regardless of the sell-out days.
3. **Choices Larger than Days**: The number of selected sell-out days `f` should not exceed the available days `n`.
4. **All Products and Clients at Maximum**: How the program handles cases where `k_i` and `l_i` are at their upper limits.
5. **Sell-Out Days More Than Available Days**: If `f > n`, which shouldn't happen since the problem specifies this as valid.

### Testing for Specific Cases:
Let's consider the following test case where products always outnumber clients but `f` is 0:
- Input: 
```
3 0
5 2
4 3
6 5
```
- Expected Output: 10 (as the total regular sales)
- The program will correctly return 10.

Now let's test the edge case with no clients:
- Input: 
```
3 1
4 0
5 0
6 0
```
- Expected Output: 0 (as no clients will buy anything)
- The program will still return 0, which is correct.

### Analysis:
1. Overall, the program correctly computes the total sales based on the descriptions without missing edge cases for days with no clients.
2. The sorting of potential sales increases and choosing the best `f` days is correctly handled.

Given the comprehensive checks against common edge cases and validations, the program meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), f is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products and clients for each of the n days.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` contains exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the values calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the sum of the elements in the regular_sales list along with the first f elements from the sorted potential_sales_increase list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), a non-negative integer `f` (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and a list `days` containing exactly `n` tuples. Each tuple consists of two integers representing the number of products `k_i` and clients `l_i` for each day. The function computes the `regular_sales` as the smaller value of `k_i` or `l_i` for each day's tuple, and calculates `potential_sales_increase` by determining how much more could be sold beyond the regular sales, given the condition of `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)`. The total sales returned is the sum of all regular sales combined with the largest `f` values from the sorted potential sales increases. If `f` is greater than the number of valid potential increases computed, the function safely handles it by only summing the available amounts. The function ensures that it operates correctly given the constraints and expected format of the parameters. In summary, it returns the total cumulative sales possible based on the provided constraints of regular and potential sales increase, and handles edge cases such as when the sales may not reach the desired increase due to limits in `k` and `l`.
