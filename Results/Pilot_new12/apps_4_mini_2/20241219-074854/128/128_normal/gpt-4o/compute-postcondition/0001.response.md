The code initializes the variable `potential_sales_increase` as an empty list. This does not affect any of the existing variables `n`, `f`, `days`, or `regular_sales`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `potential_sales_increase` has been initialized while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9), `regular_sales` is an empty list, and `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list.**
