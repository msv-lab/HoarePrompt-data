The `potential_sales_increase` list is sorted in reverse order. This affects the order of the values in `potential_sales_increase` but does not change its actual values or any other variable. The states of the other variables remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` contains exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is sorted in descending order, `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`.**
