Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` contains exactly `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the values calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple in `days`.**
