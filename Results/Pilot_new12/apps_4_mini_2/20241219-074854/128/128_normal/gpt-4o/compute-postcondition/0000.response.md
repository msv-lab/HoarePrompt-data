The code initializes an empty list `regular_sales`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `days` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and `days` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9); `regular_sales` is an empty list.**
