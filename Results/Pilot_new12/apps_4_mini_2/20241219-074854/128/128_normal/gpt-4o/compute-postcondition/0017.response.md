Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), a non-negative integer `f` (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and a list `days` containing exactly `n` tuples. Each tuple consists of two integers representing the number of products `k_i` and clients `l_i` for each day. The function computes the `regular_sales` as the smaller value of `k_i` or `l_i` for each day's tuple, and calculates `potential_sales_increase` by determining how much more could be sold beyond the regular sales, given the condition of `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)`. The total sales returned is the sum of all regular sales combined with the largest `f` values from the sorted potential sales increases. If `f` is greater than the number of valid potential increases computed, the function safely handles it by only summing the available amounts. The function ensures that it operates correctly given the constraints and expected format of the parameters. In summary, it returns the total cumulative sales possible based on the provided constraints of regular and potential sales increase, and handles edge cases such as when the sales may not reach the desired increase due to limits in `k` and `l`.**
