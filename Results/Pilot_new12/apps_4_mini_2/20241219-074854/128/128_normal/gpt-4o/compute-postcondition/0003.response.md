The `regular_sales` list is appended with the minimum value of `k` and `l`, where `k` is the first element and `l` is the second element of the first tuple in `days`. Since `days` must contain at least one tuple, both `k` and `l` are defined, and their values will be used to determine the value appended to `regular_sales`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` contains at least 1 tuple, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list, `k` is the first element of the first tuple in days, `l` is the second element of the first tuple in days.**
