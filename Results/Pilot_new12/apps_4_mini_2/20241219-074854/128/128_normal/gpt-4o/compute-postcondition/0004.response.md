To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given conditions and the impact of the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)
- `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n)
- `days` contains at least 1 tuple (meaning it has at least one element)
- `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l`
- `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list
- `k` is the first element of the first tuple in `days`
- `l` is the second element of the first tuple in `days`

### Code Execution:
```python
potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
```
1. Calculate `min(k, l)` which will produce a value based on the comparison of `k` and `l`.
2. Calculate `min(2 * k, l)` which compares `2 * k` with `l`.
3. The result of `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` will be calculated and appended to `potential_sales_increase`.

### Variable Impact:
- `potential_sales_increase` will no longer be an empty list as we will append a calculated value to it.
- `k` and `l` remain unchanged, as the values only affect the computations and do not alter their original states.

### Summary of Values:
We derived that `potential_sales_increase` will contain a new value based on the specified calculations. However, we can denote it as an expression since the exact numerical result will depend on the actual values of `k` and `l`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` contains at least 1 tuple, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` contains a value equal to `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l),` `k` is the first element of the first tuple in days, and `l` is the second element of the first tuple in days.**
