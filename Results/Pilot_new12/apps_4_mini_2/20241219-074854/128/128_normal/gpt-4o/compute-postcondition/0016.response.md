The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: 

1. `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
2. `f`, which is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n).
3. `days`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `k_i` and `l_i` (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9), representing the number of products and clients for each of the n days.

After executing the function body, it returns `total_sales`, which is the sum of the elements in the `regular_sales` list combined with the first `f` elements from the sorted `potential_sales_increase` list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, then compute and return the total sales based on regular sales and potential sales increases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), f (non-negative integer), and days (list of tuples with two integers each). It returns total_sales, which is the sum of the elements in the regular_sales list and the first f elements from the sorted potential_sales_increase list.**
