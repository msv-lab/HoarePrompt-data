You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, f) = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (k, l) = map(int, input().split())
        days.append((k, l))
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
    print(sold)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly implements a strategy to maximize total product sales over the planned days, factoring in the option for increased sales on selected sell-out days.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of days (`n`) and the number of sell-out days (`f`).
   - It constructs a list `days` containing the product availability (`k`) and client count (`l`) for each of the `n` days.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The program sorts the days based on the difference `(l - k)`, which represents how many clients are left without products on a typical day. This sorting intends to prioritize days where the difference is larger, potentially maximizing sales when those days are selected for sell-out.

3. **Calculating Sold Products**:
   - The program loops through the sorted `days`, computing the number of products sold. For the first `f` days (the sel-out days), it accounts for double the product availability; for the rest, it uses the normal product availability.
   - Using `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` for sell-out days ensures that the number of products sold does not exceed the clients present, as clients will only buy what’s available.

### Potential Issues to Identify:

1. **Edge Cases with `f = 0`**:
   - If `f = 0`, the program should sell products based on initial values of `k` only, which it seems to handle correctly. It should return the sum of `min(k[i], l[i])` for all days, which matches the expected behavior.

2. **When `f > 0` but products are already insufficient**:
   - Consider a scenario where all clients are more than the products available, and choose the `f` days that don't maximize the potential sales despite the sorting:
     Suppose for 3 days:
     ```
     1 5
     1 3
     1 2
     ```
     When `f = 1`, if we select the first day for sell-out (resulting in 2 products), the total sold would be 2 (2 on the sell-out day, 3 on second day, 2 on third day) = 7. An optimal selection would have been the second day for sell-out (resulting in 2 products on day 2) yielding total sales of 8.

### Conclusion:
The program could fail to yield the correct maximum total sales if days are chosen suboptimally based on the sorting applied. 

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not correctly account for selecting optimal days to maximize sales in all cases due to its sorting mechanism that might not yield the best possible choice for sell-out days.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function computes the total number of products that can be sold over a given number of days, considering a maximum number of days allowed for sell-out. It accepts input regarding the number of days (`n`), the maximum number of sell-out days (`f`), and for each day, the number of products available (`k`) and the number of clients expected (`l`). The function first collects this data and sorts the days based on the difference between clients and products available, in descending order. It calculates the total products sold, doubling the quantity sold on the first `f` days (if clients allow), and then limiting to the actual available products on the remaining days. Finally, the function prints the total sold products. 

Potential edge cases include:
- Scenarios where there are fewer days (`n`) than the specified sell-out days (`f`).
- Cases where the number of products available or clients expected is zero, which means no sales can occur regardless of the number of days.

The function does not return a value; instead, it directly outputs the total sold products. The parameters are taken from user input rather than passed as arguments to the function itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
