`k` and `l` are assigned values obtained from `input()` which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `k` and `l` will be provided from the user input, but the conditions surrounding `n` and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will include that information.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `f + 1`, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list containing the tuples `(k, l)` where `k` and `l` are input integers.**
