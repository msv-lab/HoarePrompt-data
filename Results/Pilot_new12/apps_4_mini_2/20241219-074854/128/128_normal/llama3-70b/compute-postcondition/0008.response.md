According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the value of `f`. The loop iterates as long as `_` takes on values from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than `f + 1`, meaning for the loop to execute one more time, we must have at least `n` being `f + 2` or more. Since the loop will execute once for each increment of `_`, we also need to set `_` to `f + 1` for the loop to iterate again.

State: **`n` must be greater than `f + 2`, `_` is `f + 1`, `days` is now updated to include `(k, l)`**
