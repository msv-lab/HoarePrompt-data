In this code snippet, the loop is designed to iterate `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. The states that need to be adjusted before the loop starts include the variables that will be used during the iteration.

1. The variable `i` will start at 0 before the loop executes and will increment after each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.
2. Since `n` is already stated as a positive integer, it ensures the loop will execute at least once.

At the end of the last iteration, `sold` is 0, but that doesn't affect whether the loop can execute; it will simply update or utilize this variable within the loop's body, once it runs.

Therefore, before entering the loop, we can summarize the necessary state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a sorted list of tuples, `sold` is 0, `i` is 0**
