Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a sorted list of tuples, and `sold` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than `f`, `sold` is increased by the minimum of `days[i][0] * 2` and `days[i][1]`, while `i` remains 0. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `f`, `sold` is increased by the minimum of `days[i][0]` and `days[i][1]`.***
