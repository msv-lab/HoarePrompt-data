The code `days.append((k, l))` adds a tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. Since `n` must be greater than `f + 1` and `f` is a non-negative integer, this condition suggests that `n` has a lower bound depending on the value of `f`. The state of `days` will now include the new tuple as part of its list. The variable values of `k` and `l` are appended as a new tuple to `days`, while `n` and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `f + 1`, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is now updated to include `(k, l)`.**
