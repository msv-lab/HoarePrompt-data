The `days` list is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)`, which are input integers. The condition regarding `n` and `_` remains unchanged, as they do not affect the addition to `days`. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `f + 2`; `_` is `f + 1`; `days` is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are input integers.**
