The variable `sold` is incremented by the minimum of `days[i][0] * 2` and `days[i][1]`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `days` remain unchanged, but the new value of `sold` depends on the calculation of the minimum. 

Precondition summary: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `f` is a non-negative integer
- `days` is a sorted list of tuples
- `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`
- `i` is incremented by 0

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a sorted list of tuples, `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`, `i` is 0 and current value of `i` is still less than `f`.**
