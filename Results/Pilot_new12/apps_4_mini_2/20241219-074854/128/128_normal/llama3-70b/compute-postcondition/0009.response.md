The variables `k` and `l` are assigned values through the function `map(int, input().split())`, which takes user input, splits it into components, and converts them to integers. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than `f + 2`, and `_` is equal to `f + 1`, while `days` is updated to include the new tuple `(k, l)`. However, since the exact values of `k`, `l`, and `f` are not provided, they cannot be specified in the output state. 

Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state focuses on the updated values without specific details on `k` and `l`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `f + 2`; `_` is `f + 1`; `days` is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)` where `k` and `l` are input integers.**
