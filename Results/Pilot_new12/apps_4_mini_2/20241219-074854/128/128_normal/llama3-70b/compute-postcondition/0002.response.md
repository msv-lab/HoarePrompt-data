According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, starting from 0 up to `n-1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop is guaranteed to start executing because `n` is at least 1. 

There are no specific initialization requirements for the loop variables inside the for loop definition, as the underscore (`_`) is used to indicate that the loop variable is not needed. However, since `days` is an empty list, its contents will need to be populated in the loop body if that is intended, but this doesn’t affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be noted for the loop to execute do not change from the initial conditions stated. The only requirement is that the loop will iterate `n` times.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is an empty list**.
