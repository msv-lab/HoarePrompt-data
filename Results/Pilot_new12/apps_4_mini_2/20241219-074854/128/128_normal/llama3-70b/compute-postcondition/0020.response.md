According to the loop statement, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. The variable `i` is the loop index that begins at 0 and is incremented automatically at the start of each iteration. The important details to consider at the end of the last iteration are:

1. The current value of `i`.
2. The value of `n`, which determines how many iterations the loop will complete.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still less than `n`, since the loop has not yet reached its limit. Therefore, for the next iteration:
- `i` will increment by 1.
- This means `i` will become 1 (since it starts at 0).

To maintain the requirements for the next loop iteration to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run one more time (since the next value of `i` will be 1).

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a sorted list of tuples, `sold` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is 1**
