The variable `days` is initialized as an empty list. The states of the other variables, `n` and `f`, remain unchanged. `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and `f` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `f` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n), `days` is an empty list.**
