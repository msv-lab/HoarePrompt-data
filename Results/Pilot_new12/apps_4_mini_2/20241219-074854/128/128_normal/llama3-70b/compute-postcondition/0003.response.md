The variables `k` and `l` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variables `n`, `f`, and `days` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is an empty list, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**.
