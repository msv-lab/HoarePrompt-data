n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of chosen days for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and for each day i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), k_i and l_i are non-negative integers representing the number of products available (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^9) and the number of clients expected (0 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^9).
