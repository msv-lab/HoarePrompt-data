Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of days, f is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ f ≤ n) representing the number of days to choose for sell-out; for each day i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), k_i (0 ≤ k_i ≤ 10^9) is the number of products available and l_i (0 ≤ l_i ≤ 10^9) is the number of clients expected.**
