The variable `plus_count` is assigned the value equal to the count of the '+' symbols in the string `s`. Since `s` consists of only the symbols "+" and "-", the actual value of `plus_count` depends on the specific composition of `s`. The variable `minus_count` counts the number of '-' in `s`, and since `s` has a total length of `n`, `minus_count` can be derived as `n - plus_count`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `minus_count` remain valid, and we include the new value for `plus_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`.**
