The variable `minus_count` is assigned the value of the count of the '-' symbols in the string `s`. The value of `n` determines the length of the string `s`, which consists of '+' and '-' symbols. Since `s` is a string of length `n`, `minus_count` will represent the number of '-' characters within that string.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-"; `minus_count` is the number of occurrences of '-' in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`.**
