The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-". The value of `n` remains unchanged but determines the length of `s`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assigned value of `s`, which is a string based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-" from user input.**
