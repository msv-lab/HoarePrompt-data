The code provided only executes a print statement, which outputs the value `0`. No variables are modified or assigned new values. The states of the variables remain unchanged; however, the action of printing implies the output of `0`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`. The current value of `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`. The value printed is 0.**
