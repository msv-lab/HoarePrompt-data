The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting exclusively of the symbols "+" and "-". After executing the function body, based on the conditions provided, the function will produce a certain output. 

However, since the specific logic-to-output mapping is not provided in the output section, I can generally conclude that the function processes the symbols in `s` based on their values ("+" and "-") and likely returns a result based on this analysis.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-". It processes the input and returns a specific output based on the symbols in `s`.**
