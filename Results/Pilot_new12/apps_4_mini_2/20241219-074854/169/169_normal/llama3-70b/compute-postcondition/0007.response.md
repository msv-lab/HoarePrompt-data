The expression `print(plus_count - minus_count)` calculates and outputs the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`. The values of these two variables are known from the initial state. Therefore, `plus_count` is an integer greater than or equal to `minus_count` due to the precondition that the count of '-' in `s` is less than or equal to the count of '+' in `s`. The output of the print statement will be the value of `plus_count - minus_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`; plus_count - minus_count is printed.**
