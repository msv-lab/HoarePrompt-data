Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-". If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, the value printed is 0. Otherwise, the printed value is the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`.***
