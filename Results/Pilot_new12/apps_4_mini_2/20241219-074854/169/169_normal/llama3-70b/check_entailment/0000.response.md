Correctness: **False**.

The program does not account for the necessary minimum number of stones before taking operations that involve removing stones. Specifically, if more operations are performed to remove stones than to add them, it does not consider that it should have started with at least as many stones as the number of removal operations to comply with the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
----
```
Here, there are 4 removal operations and 0 addition operations. According to the problem description, if Vasya took a stone 4 times, he must have started with at least 4 stones. The program incorrectly outputs `0`, instead of the correct answer `4`, which indicates that the pile must have originally had 4 stones to avoid going negative. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect and fails to handle this situation properly.
