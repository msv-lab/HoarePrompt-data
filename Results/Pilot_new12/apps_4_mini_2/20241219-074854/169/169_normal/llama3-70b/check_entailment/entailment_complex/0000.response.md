To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we can analyze the functionality of the provided code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
1. Vasya performs `n` operations, either taking a stone (`-`) or adding a stone (`+`).
2. The pile cannot be empty when a `-` operation is performed.
3. The goal is to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after all operations.

### Code Analysis
1. The function reads `n` and a string `s`.
2. It counts `minus_count` (the occurrences of `-`) and `plus_count` (the occurrences of `+`).
3. The logic checks if `minus_count` exceeds `plus_count`:
   - If it does, it prints `0`.
   - If it does not, it prints the difference `plus_count - minus_count`.

### Correctness Discussion
- If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, it indicates more removals than additions. The program correctly returns `0`, which follows from the requirement that the pile cannot be empty during a `-` operation. Therefore, if there are more `-` operations, it implies that the minimum starting amount must have been at least equal to `minus_count`, thus the remaining stones after operations would be `0`.
- If `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, it calculates `plus_count - minus_count`. This represents the net increase in stones, which correctly aligns with the problem description where the outcome is the minimal amount of stones left after all operations.

### Edge Cases
1. All operations are `-`: If `s` were `"---"` (and `n` is 3), the function would output `0`, which correctly represents the state as described.
2. All operations are `+`: If `s` is `"++++"` (and `n` is 4), the function would output `4`, accurately reflecting that the number of stones would only increase.
3. Mixed operations: For cases like `"-+"`, it correctly computes the minimum as `1`.

### Conclusion
The program adequately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description under all valid scenarios presented. Therefore, we can state that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
