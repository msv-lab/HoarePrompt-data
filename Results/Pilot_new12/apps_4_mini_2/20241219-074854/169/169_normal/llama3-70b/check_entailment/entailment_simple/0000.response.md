To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the provided problem description, we analyze the logic implemented in the annotated program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vasya performs `n` operations of either adding a stone ("+") or taking a stone ("-"), with the initial pile being non-empty just before the "-" operations.
- We need to find the minimal number of stones left in the pile after `n` operations.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes an integer input `n` which represents the number of operations.
   - It then takes a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of "+" and "-" characters.

2. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program counts the number of "-" operations as `minus_count`.
   - It counts the number of "+" operations as `plus_count`.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, it prints `0`. This indicates that if there are more minus operations than plus, it is assumed the total stones cannot go below zero, hence the output is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `plus_count - minus_count`. This represents the net increase in stones if the plus operations exceed minus operations.

### Verification of Logic:
- When `minus_count` exceeds `plus_count`, even if there are more minus operations, the output should account for the minimum required starting stones so that Vasya is never left trying to take a stone from an empty pile.
  
  The correct logic says:
  - If `minus_count > plus_count`, the minimum number of stones at the end is constrained to `0` since you cannot have negative stones, and you would need at least `minus_count` stones initially but cannot end up with fewer than `0` stones.

- When `plus_count >= minus_count`, it is correct to output `plus_count - minus_count` as this reflects the net result of all operations assuming we start with just enough stones to avoid going negative.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimal possible number of stones after all operations according to the rules described in the problem statement. Additionally, it handles cases where the required initial conditions are met.

Therefore, we can confidently say:

Correctness: **True**
