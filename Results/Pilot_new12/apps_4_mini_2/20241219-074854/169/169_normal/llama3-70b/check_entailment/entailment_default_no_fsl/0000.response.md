Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations, particularly in situations where the count of "-" (taken stones) exceeds the number of "+" (added stones). According to the problem description, Vasya must have enough stones at the beginning to perform all the "-" operations uninterrupted.

For example, consider the case where **n = 4** and the operations string **s = "----"**. In this situation, Vasya needs at least 4 stones to perform all "-". However, the program will incorrectly return 0 because it counts only the "-" operations and does not consider that starting below that threshold would render the operations impossible. 

The condition `if minus_count > plus_count:` leading to printing `0` is inadequate because it fails to recognize that Vasya must start with enough stones to accommodate all the "-" operations. Thus, for this input, the expected output should actually be impossible, so the function does not produce an accurate result according to the problem description.

Since there are cases where the program's logic fails to meet these requirements, the overall correctness is deemed false.
