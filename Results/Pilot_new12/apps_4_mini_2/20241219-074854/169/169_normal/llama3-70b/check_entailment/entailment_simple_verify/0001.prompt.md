You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
---

Output
0
Input
4
++++

Output

Input

-+

Output

Input
5
++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used to derive the minimal number of stones in the pile after `n` operations.

1. **Understanding Inputs and Logic:**
   - `s.count('-')`: This counts how many times a stone was taken from the pile.
   - `s.count('+')`: This counts how many times a stone was added to the pile.
   - If the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations, it implies that Vasya has taken more stones than he added, which means the minimum possible stones remaining would be 0. This is because he couldn't take stones if he started with fewer than what he needed.
   - Otherwise, the remaining stones would be calculated as the difference between the number of "+" operations and the number of "-" operations.

2. **Evaluation of Outputs:**
   - If `minus_count > plus_count`, the output is `0`, which seems correct since Vasya could only have non-negative stones in the pile.
   - If `minus_count <= plus_count`, the output is `plus_count - minus_count`, which effectively calculates the remaining stones correctly.

3. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no "+" operations at all (i.e., the string is entirely composed of "-"), the program outputs `0`, which is correct as Vasya cannot end up with a negative number of stones.
   - If all operations are "+", the output will be equal to the count of "+" operations, which is also correct.
   - Finally, the case where operations are mixed (like "-+") also seems to be handled correctly, considering the return value is derived from the difference between added and taken stones.

4. **Testing Against Example Cases:**
   - Reviewing the provided examples, the program returns correct outputs as expected.

5. **Missing Logic:**
   - The program assumes that the negative operations can never exceed positive operations if returning a non-zero count, however, the code does not explicitly check the initial number of stones. Given that if the final result is to be entirely accurate, it needs to ensure that there were enough stones before any operation—this is naturally handled because of how the counts are designed.

After reviewing the code and logic, I failed to find any case where it would not meet the requirements articulated in the problem description. Thus, no example exists where the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if (minus_count > plus_count) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only the symbols "+" and "-". If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, the value printed is 0. Otherwise, the printed value is the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
