Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to account for the necessary starting number of stones required to satisfy the operations described in the problem. Specifically, if the number of "-" operations (removals) exceeds the number of "+" operations (additions), the program incorrectly outputs `0` instead of the appropriate minimum starting count of stones. For instance, in the case of input `4\n----`, logically Vasya must have started with at least `4` stones to perform the removals without running into a negative count. Therefore, the assessment that the program is incorrect holds true, as it does not align with the problem description, particularly in cases where the removal operations exceed the addition ones.
