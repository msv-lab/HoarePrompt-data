The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting solely of the symbols "+" and "-". It counts the occurrences of the "-" symbols and the "+" symbols in the string `s`. If the count of "-" symbols (`minus_count`) exceeds the count of "+" symbols (`plus_count`), it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the count of "+" and "-" symbols, (`plus_count - minus_count`). The function ultimately ensures that the output is either 0 (if "-" symbols are more) or a non-negative integer representing the surplus of "+" symbols over "-" symbols. Note that there is no return statement; the output is printed directly. Additionally, the function lacks handling for invalid input scenarios, such as when the input string contains characters other than "+" or "-".
