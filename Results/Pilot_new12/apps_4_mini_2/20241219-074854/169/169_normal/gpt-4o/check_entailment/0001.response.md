Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program adheres to the specifications:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `stones` to 0, which is a valid starting point since Vasya can start with any non-negative number of stones.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation in the input string:
     - If the operation is '+', it increments the `stones` count.
     - If the operation is '-', it decreases the `stones` count but ensures that it does not go below zero by using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This correctly handles the requirement that Vasya cannot take a stone if the pile is empty.

3. **Final Output**: The program prints the final count of `stones`, which represents the minimal possible number of stones left after all operations.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- If all operations are `+`, the output will simply be the number of `+` operations, which is correct.
- If the operations are all `-`, the program will reach zero stones, which is the correct output as provided in the description.
- Mixed operations will always ensure the number of stones does not drop below zero, fulfilling the problem conditions.

Given these points and the ability of the code to handle each possible case outlined in the problem description correctly, the code is verified to be correct.
