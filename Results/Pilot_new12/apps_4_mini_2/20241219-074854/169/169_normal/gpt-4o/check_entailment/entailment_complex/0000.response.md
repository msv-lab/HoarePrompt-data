The annotated program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Let's analyze its behavior step by step against the specified requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The first line of input correctly reads the integer `n`, which represents the number of operations (between 1 and 100). The second line reads the string `s` containing `n` operations represented by the characters "+" and "-". This is aligned with the problem description, which specifies the constraints for `n` and the content of `s`.

2. **Stone Count Calculation**:
    - The program initializes `stones` to 0, which is appropriate because we need to calculate the net effect of the operations.
    - Each time the program encounters a "+", it correctly increases the `stones` count by 1.
    - Each time it encounters a "-", it decreases the `stones` count by 1, but also applies the correct logic to ensure `stones` never drops below 0 using `max(0, stones - 1)`. This matches the description that the pile was non-empty before taking a stone, ensuring that we correctly simulate the operations given the constraints.

3. **Final Output**: After processing all operations in `s`, the program prints the final count of `stones`. This correctly represents the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations since it accounts for the operations while ensuring that no operation leads to a negative stone count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Consider the case where the input string consists entirely of "-" operations. The program ensures that even if all operations are "-", it won't allow the `stones` count to drop below 0.
    - For a case with all "+" operations, it correctly accumulates the count of stones, which aligns with the requirement that the outcome reflects the total number of stones added.
    - Mixed operations are handled correctly as well, reflecting the net change based on the number of "+" and "-" operations.

Since the logic implemented in the program adheres to the conditions set out in the problem description and correctly computes the minimum possible stones left after `n` operations based on valid inputs, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
