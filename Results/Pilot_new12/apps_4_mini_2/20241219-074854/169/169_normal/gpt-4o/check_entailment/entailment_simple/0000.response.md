To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap
1. Vasya has a pile of stones.
2. He performs `n` operations, represented by a string of `n` characters consisting of "+" (adding a stone) and "-" (taking a stone).
3. The pile must be non-empty before any "-" operation.
4. We need to determine the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after all operations.

### Provided Annotated Program Analysis
The function `func` implements the following logic:
1. It reads the integer `n` and the string `s` of operations.
2. It initializes a counter (`stones`) to keep track of the current number of stones.
3. For each operation in `s`:
   - If the operation is "+", it increments the count of stones.
   - If the operation is "-", it decrements the count of stones but ensures that it does not drop below 0 using `max(0, stones - 1)`.
4. Finally, the program prints the number of stones.

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Initial Stones Count**: The program effectively starts with 0 stones and adds stones during each "+" operation. When it encounters a "-" operation, it reduces the count but ensures it cannot go below 0.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The use of `max(0, stones - 1)` adheres to the premise that Vasya cannot have a negative number of stones at any time, which is crucial because he cannot take a stone from an empty pile.
  
### Logical Flow
- **At the Beginning**: The assumption that Vasya starts with an adequate number of stones (at least as many as he needs to perform his "-" operations) is implicitly handled by ensuring the output is never less than 0.
- **Final Count**: The final output of stones after executing all operations reflects the minimal stones left such that the initial number of stones could indeed have been 0, or adjusted according to the operations.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the described rules of operation and handles all given cases as specified in the problem description. It ensures that at no point does the stone count go below 0, thus adhering to the requirement that Vasya cannot operate on an empty pile.

**Correctness: True**
