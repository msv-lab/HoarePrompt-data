To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze how the code processes the series of operations that Vasya performs on the pile of stones.

### Problem Analysis
1. The number of operations `n` can be a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100.
2. If Vasya performs `-`, it means he took a stone from the pile, and he cannot do this if the pile is empty.
3. If he performs `+`, he adds a stone to the pile. 

### Requirements
- The pile must be non-empty before any `-` operation.
- We need to determine the minimal number of stones that can be left after performing all operations.

### Program Logic
- `stones` is initialized to 0.
- For each operation in the string `s`:
  - If the operation is `+`, it increases `stones` by 1.
  - If the operation is `-`, it decreases `stones` by 1 but ensures that `stones` does not go below 0 using `max(0, stones - 1)`.

### Potential Issues
1. The program does not account for the initial number of stones needed to successfully perform `-` operations:
   - For example, if `s` is `---`, Vasya would need at least 3 initial stones. The code might assume it can always start from 0 and just go to 0 as a valid final state. However, that violates the requirement that it cannot be empty when a `-` operation is performed.
2. The minimal number of stones calculation after all operations should reflect the minimum stones needed to fulfill all operations, which should take into account the initial state.

### Failure Case
- Consider the input:
```
3
---
```
In this case, Vasya needs at least 3 stones initially to perform three consecutive `-` operations. The provided program would output `0`, which contradicts the requirement that denotes the pile must be non-empty before each `-` operation.

### Conclusion
Given that the program can lead to incorrect results for certain valid inputs according to the stated rules, we reach the conclusion:

Correctness: **False**.
