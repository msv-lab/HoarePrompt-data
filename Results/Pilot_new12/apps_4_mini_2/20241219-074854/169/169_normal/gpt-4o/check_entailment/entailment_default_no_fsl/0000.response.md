Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions set forth in the problem description. Specifically, the logic fails to account for the minimum number of stones that must exist before any "-" operation is executed. 

For example, when the input is `2` and the string `s` is `-+`, according to the rules, Vasya cannot take a stone (i.e., perform the "-" operation) unless there is at least one stone present. However, the program allows stones to drop to zero even when it starts with fewer than required stones.

To illustrate:
- For `s = -+`, in a valid scenario, Vasya must start with at least one stone. The program would output `1` after processing, but it should instead consider if Vasya could start with more than one stone to account for the operation sequence.

Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description correctly and fails in scenarios like the one mentioned, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
