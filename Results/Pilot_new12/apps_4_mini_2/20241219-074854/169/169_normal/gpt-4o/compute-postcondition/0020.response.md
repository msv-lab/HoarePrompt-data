Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `operation` is the character in `s` at `index + 1`. If `operation` is '+', `stones` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `index` is incremented by 1, and if `operation` is '-', then `stones` is either 0 or decremented by 1 from its previous positive value.***
