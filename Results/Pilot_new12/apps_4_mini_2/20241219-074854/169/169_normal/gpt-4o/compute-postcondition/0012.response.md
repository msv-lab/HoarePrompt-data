The `stones` variable is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is still valid as a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` remains a string of length `n`, and `operation` is still the next character in the string `s` at `index`. The value of `stones` has now increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operation` is the next character in the string `s` at `index`, `stones` is increased by 1.**
