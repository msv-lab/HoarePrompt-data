The variable `stones` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, the new value of `stones` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `operation` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "+" and "-", `stones` is 1, and `operation` is '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "+" and "-", `stones` is 1, `operation` is '+'**.
