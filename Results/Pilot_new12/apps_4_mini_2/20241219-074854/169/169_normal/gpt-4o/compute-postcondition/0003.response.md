According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The string `s` has a length of `n`, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Therefore, as long as `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

In the context of the loop, the variable `operation` will be assigned each character in the string `s` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `stones` is initialized to 0, which will be modified in the loop body based on the operations defined by the symbols in `s`. 

Therefore, to summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

1. `n` must be a positive integer (as it's given).
2. `s` is a string of length `n`, which is valid by the conditions stated.
3. There are no requirements for the initial value of `stones` to determine the execution of the loop, but it will change as the loop executes.

The important consideration here is that `s` must contain operations to process.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "+" and "-", `stones` is 0**
