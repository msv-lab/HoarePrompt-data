The code snippet provided simply prints the value of `stones`. The initial state specifies that `stones` is derived from counting the number of '+' and '-' in the string `s`, and that it cannot be less than 0.

Since the exact value of `stones` is not specified but is determined by the operations in `s`, we can assert that the output of the print statement will reflect this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "+" and "-", `stones` is the net effect of all operations in `s`, which is equal to the count of '+' minus the count of '-' but cannot be less than 0, and it is printed.**
