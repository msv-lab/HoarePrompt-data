The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the symbols "+" and "-". Based on these inputs, the function performs operations and produces a specific output. However, the output hasn't been provided in your input, so I'm unable to describe it specifically. If we consider potential returns, there could be a variety of outcomes depending on the implementation. For example, the function might return a total count of each symbol or an aggregate based on the symbols. 

Nevertheless, based on the information given:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` within the range of 1 to 100 and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "+" and "-".**
