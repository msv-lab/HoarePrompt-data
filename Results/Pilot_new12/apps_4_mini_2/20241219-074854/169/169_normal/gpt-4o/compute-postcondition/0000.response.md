Since `n` is being reassigned the value from `int(input())`, and it is initially a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, the new value of `n` can vary depending on user input, but it must remain a positive integer within that same range. The string `s` remains unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, all we know after executing the code is that `n` is reassigned to a new positive integer within the range, and `s` retains its initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the symbols "+" and "-".**
