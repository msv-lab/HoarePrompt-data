Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `operation` is the next character in the string `s` at `index`. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is increased by 1. If `operation` is '-', `stones` is either decreased by 1 (if `stones` > 0) or set to 0 (if `stones` = 0).***
