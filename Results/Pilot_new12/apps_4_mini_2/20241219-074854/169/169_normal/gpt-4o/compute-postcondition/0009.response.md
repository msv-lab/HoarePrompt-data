Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "+" and "-", `stones` is 0, and `operation` is '-'. Since there is no else part, the function will only handle the case where `operation` is '-', maintaining the initial conditions for `n`, `s`, and `stones`.***
