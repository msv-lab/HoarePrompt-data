According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the current character `operation` at the given `index`. Since `operation` iterates through the characters of the string `s`, the loop will execute one more time if `index` is less than `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n`, and `operation` is the character in the string at the current `index`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `index` will need to be `index + 1` and `operation` will be the corresponding character in `s` at that new index.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `index` must be incremented by 1 and `operation` must be the next character in `s`. Therefore, we adjust the state accordingly. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, operation is the character in `s` at `index + 1`, index is `index + 1`**
