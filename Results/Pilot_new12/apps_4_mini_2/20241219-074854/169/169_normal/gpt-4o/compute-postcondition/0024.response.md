Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` composed solely of the characters "+" and "-". It calculates the resultant value of `stones` based on the operations encoded in `s`, where each "+" increases the count of `stones` by 1 and each "-" decreases `stones` by 1, ensuring that `stones` does not drop below 0. After processing all characters in `s`, the function outputs the final value of `stones`.**

**Final state of the program is that the variable `stones` reflects the net positive count of operations represented in the string `s`, with the outcome being the count of '+' minus the count of '-' but constrained to be at least 0.**
