`stones` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `operation`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the original conditions, with the only modification being the increment of `stones`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operation` is the character in `s` at `index + 1`, `index` is `index + 1`, `stones` is increased by 1.**
