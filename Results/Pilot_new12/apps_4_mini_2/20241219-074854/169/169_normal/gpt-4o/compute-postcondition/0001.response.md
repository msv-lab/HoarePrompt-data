The value of `s` is assigned the value `input()`, which accepts a string input containing only the symbols "+" and "-" and has a length equal to `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its value as a positive integer in the range from 1 to 100. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `s` as a string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the symbols "+" and "-" as input.**
