The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` composed solely of the characters "+" and "-". It calculates the resultant value of `stones` based on the operations encoded in `s`, where each "+" increases the count of `stones` by 1 and each "-" decreases `stones` by 1, ensuring that `stones` does not drop below 0. After processing all characters in `s`, the function outputs the final value of `stones`.
