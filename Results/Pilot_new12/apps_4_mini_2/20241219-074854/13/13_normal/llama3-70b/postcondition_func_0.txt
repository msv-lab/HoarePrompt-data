The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of the characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). It calculates the maximum sequence of consecutive 'G' characters found in `s`, denoted as `max_beauty`, and then considers the possibility of swapping a 'G' adjacent to an 'S' to maximize the beauty score further. It computes another score, `max_beauty_one_swap`, representing the maximum beauty achievable through such a swap. Finally, the function outputs the greater of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. 

The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result. Notably, if the string contains only 'S' characters, both `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` would remain 0, and the output will be 0. This highlights that the edge cases of not having any 'G' characters are handled. Furthermore, the processing assumes that valid input is provided, as indicated in the preconditions. However, there is an implicit assumption in the code that it never encounters the case of `n` being less than 2 or more than 100,000, as enforced by the constraints given before the function call.
