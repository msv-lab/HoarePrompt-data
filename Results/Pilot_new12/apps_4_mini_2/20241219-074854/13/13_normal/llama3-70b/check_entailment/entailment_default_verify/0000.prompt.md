You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code:

The task is to compute the maximum length of a contiguous segment of golden trophies 'G' after potentially one swap with a silver trophy 'S'.

The program performs the following steps:
1. It collects the indices of all golden trophies.
2. It calculates the maximum contiguous segment of golden trophies without any swap.
3. Then it calculates the maximum contiguous segment of golden trophies that can be formed by swapping one 'S' with either of the 'G's adjoining it.

However, let's explore potential edge cases the program might be missing:
- Consider the input `n = 5` and `s = "SGSGS"`. Here, the longest segment of 'G's is `1` (since there are three 'S's separating them), and there's no way to swap to improve this maximum. The output should be `1`, as that is the max length we can achieve even after considering swaps.
  
However, the program will mistakenly compute the maximum with its loop and may not find any valid swap scenario or miscalculate when multiple segments are involved. Specifically, it might end up finding 2 segments of `G` but won't combine them correctly using the `S` in between.

For a valid test case:
Input:
```
5
SGSGS
```
Expected Output: 
```
1
```
Let's consider what the code might calculate:
1. It finds the individual segments of `G`, printed `1`.
2. It might then consider the swap incorrectly, concluding misleading max lengths based on the gaps present.

Thus, this input demonstrates a scenario where the program does not function as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program has flaws in its logic when handling specific arrangements of 'G's and 'S's that prevent it from yielding the maximum length correctly in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of the characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). It calculates the maximum sequence of consecutive 'G' characters found in `s`, denoted as `max_beauty`, and then considers the possibility of swapping a 'G' adjacent to an 'S' to maximize the beauty score further. It computes another score, `max_beauty_one_swap`, representing the maximum beauty achievable through such a swap. Finally, the function outputs the greater of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. 

The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result. Notably, if the string contains only 'S' characters, both `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` would remain 0, and the output will be 0. This highlights that the edge cases of not having any 'G' characters are handled. Furthermore, the processing assumes that valid input is provided, as indicated in the preconditions. However, there is an implicit assumption in the code that it never encounters the case of `n` being less than 2 or more than 100,000, as enforced by the constraints given before the function call.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
