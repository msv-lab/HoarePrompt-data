Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, and `right` is at least 1 and is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is updated to 2 while `max_beauty` remains 0, and `left` continues to be the index of the first 'G' in `s`. Otherwise, if `s[right]` is not 'G', then `left` points to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `right`, `s[left]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` resets to 1, `max_beauty` updates to 1, and `left` continues to be less than `right`.***
