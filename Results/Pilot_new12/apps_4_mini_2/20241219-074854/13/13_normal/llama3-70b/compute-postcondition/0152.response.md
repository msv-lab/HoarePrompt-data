To determine the necessary state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop:

1. The loop control variable `j` starts at `i + 2`.
2. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`, iterating over the range from `i + 2` to `n - 1`.
3. Since `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, we need to find out what `j` needs to be for the loop to run for one more iteration.
4. The last value of `j` before the loop breaks depends on the current state after the last iteration.

Given the state at the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5\).
- `i` is an integer \(\geq 1\) and \(< n - 2\).
- `j` is initialized to \(i + 2\).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The current `j` must be less than `n`.
- After incrementing `j` by one in this iteration, it will be \(j + 1\), which must also ensure \(j + 1 < n\).
  
Thus, if `j` is currently equal to \(n - 1\), the next increment would make `j` equal to `n`, which would stop the loop. Thus, to allow one more iteration, \(j\) needs to be at most \(n - 2\).

Starting at the last known `j`:
- If `j` equals \(i + 2\), on the next call \(j\) would increase to \(i + 3\) on the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5\), `i` is an integer \(\ge 1\) and \(< n - 2\), `j` is `i + 3`.**
