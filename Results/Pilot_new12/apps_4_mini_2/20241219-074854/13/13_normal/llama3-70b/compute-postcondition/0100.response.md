The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1 as per the provided code. The conditions surrounding the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. 

Since `beauty` could hold any integer value prior to this operation, we can denote the updated value of `beauty` as `beauty + 1`, while the other variables retain their previously defined ranges and relationships.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, and `beauty` is updated to `beauty + 1`.**
