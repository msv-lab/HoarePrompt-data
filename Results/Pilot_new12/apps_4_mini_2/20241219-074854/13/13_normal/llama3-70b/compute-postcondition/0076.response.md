The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found before `i` plus 1, this means that the new value of `beauty` is the previous value plus 1. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `i`, `s`, and the character at index `j` in list `s` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4 if `i` is 1, or at least 5 if `i` is 2; `s` is a list of characters; `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found before `i` plus the initial value of 2; the character at index `j` in the list `s` is 'G'.**
