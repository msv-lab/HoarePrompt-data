Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is 2; if `s[0]` is 'G', then `beauty` can be 2 or 3 depending on the value of `s[0]`. If `s[0]` is not 'G', then when `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` can be 2 or 3, while if `s[j]` is not 'G', `beauty` increments by 1 and can remain at 1 if `s[0]` is not 'G', breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
