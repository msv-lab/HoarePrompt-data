`beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `beauty` changes from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s[j]`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 2, `j` starts from `i - 1`, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 2, `j` starts from `i - 1`, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
