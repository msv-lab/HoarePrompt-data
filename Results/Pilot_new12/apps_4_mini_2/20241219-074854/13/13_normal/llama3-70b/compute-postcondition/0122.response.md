Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is in the range [i + 2, n). `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i]` onward until a non-'G' character is encountered. If there were no consecutive 'G' characters after `s[i]`, then `beauty` would remain the same as it was before entering the loop.**
