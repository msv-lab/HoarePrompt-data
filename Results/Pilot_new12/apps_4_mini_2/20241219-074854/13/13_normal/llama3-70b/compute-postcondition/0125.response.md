According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is the incremented value (i + 1), and `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again. Given the constraints stated, `n` is between 2 and 100,000 and must remain greater than `i + 1`.

Since the iteration for the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`, this means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n - 1`. 

Currently, `i` is the incremented value, meaning it is now equal to `i + 1` after the last execution of the loop's body. Hence, the next iteration will start with `i` receiving a value of `i + 1`, which will give us:

- New `i` will equal `i + 1` after this iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` after we adjust `i`.

Thus, the adjusted states should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `i` is the incremented value (i + 2) with `n` being greater than `i + 2**.
