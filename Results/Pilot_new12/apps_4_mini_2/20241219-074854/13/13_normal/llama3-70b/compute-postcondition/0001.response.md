The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and that `s` will hold the input string. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'**.
