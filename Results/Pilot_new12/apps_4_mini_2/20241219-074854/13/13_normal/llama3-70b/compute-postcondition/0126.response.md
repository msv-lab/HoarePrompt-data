The variable `beauty` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and `i` is the incremented value `(i + 2)`, with the condition that `n` is greater than `i + 2`. The changes affect only the variable `beauty`. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions regarding `n` and `i` but updates `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is the incremented value (i + 2), `n` is greater than `i + 2, `beauty` is 1**
