The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` represents the count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[i-1]` and going backward, the variable will now reflect one additional 'G' character. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` backward plus 1.**
