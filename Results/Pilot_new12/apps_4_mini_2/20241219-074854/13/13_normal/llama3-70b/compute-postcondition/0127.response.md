According to the code, for the loop to execute, we need the starting value of `j` which is `i - 1` to be non-negative. This means that `i` must be at least 1, since the loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. 

Since the problem states that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than `i + 2`, we still need to ensure that `i` satisfies this condition. Given that `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 2, we can work with the constraints that `i` must also fulfill.

Consequently, for the loop to execute, we can summarize the conditions as follows:

1. `i` must be at least 1 (to ensure that `i - 1` is not negative).
2. `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, indicating that `n` is significantly larger than `i`.

Therefore, we need to acknowledge the following states adjustments:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` starts at i - 1**
