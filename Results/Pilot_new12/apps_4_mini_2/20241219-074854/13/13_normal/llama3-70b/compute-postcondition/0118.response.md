According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 2` and goes up to but not including `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `i` is at least 1, so the minimum value for `i + 2` is 3.
- Since `n` is greater than `i + 3`, it means that `n` must be at least 5 (which is 3 + 2 to allow for the next iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, if it was the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `n - 1`. 

So, to execute again, we increment `j` by 1, and we deduce the following:
- The new value of `j` will be `i + 2 + 1 = i + 3`.
- Since `n` must be greater than `j`, we need `n` to be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`**.
