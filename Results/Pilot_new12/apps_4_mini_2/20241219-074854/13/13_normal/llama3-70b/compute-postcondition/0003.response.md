In the provided code, `max_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `max_beauty` is affected, while the values of `n`, `s`, and `golden` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will indicate that `max_beauty` has been initialized to 0, and include that other variables retain their previous definitions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0.**
