According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` starts from `i - 1`, which is at least 0 since `i` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to `j - 1`. Given that `j` currently has a value of `i - 1`, after decrementing `j`, its new value will be `i - 2`.

Furthermore, since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, that condition remains fulfilled. However, we do not need to modify `n` since it is not directly impacted by the loop’s execution. The focus is solely on the decrement of `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i - 2`.**
