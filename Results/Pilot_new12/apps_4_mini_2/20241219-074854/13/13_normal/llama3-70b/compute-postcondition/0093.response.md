To determine the necessary conditions for the for loop to execute, let's analyze the given details step by step.

The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, `j` starts from `i - 1` and decrements until it reaches -1 (exclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, the starting condition must be valid.

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is the incremented value. Therefore, `i` needs to be an integer greater than 0 for `i - 1` to be non-negative.
2. The condition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` translates to `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Keeping this in mind, for both conditions to hold true:
   - `i` must be at least 1 (so that `i - 1` is 0 or more, providing the loop a starting point to execute).
   - Also, `n` must be at least `i + 1 + 1` which simplifies to `n` must be at least `i + 2` for the condition `n > i + 1` to be upheld.
   
Given that `n` can range from 2 to 100,000, we need to ensure that `i < n - 1`.

Now consolidating these points:

- For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 1.
- `j` will start at `i - 1`, which means if `i` is 1, `j` will be 0, leading to at least one iteration.
- The condition that `n` is greater than `i + 1` remains valid so long as we adjust `i`.

So, to summarize the state requirements:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 1, and `j` will start from `i - 1`**.
