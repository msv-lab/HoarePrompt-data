According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues executing as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index checked, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` becomes one greater, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which means that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `i` is less than `n - 1`, the new values at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is the incremented value (i + 1), and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
