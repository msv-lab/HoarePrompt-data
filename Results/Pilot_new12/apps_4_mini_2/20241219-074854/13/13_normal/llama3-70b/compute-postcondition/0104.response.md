The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Since `beauty` is stated to remain unchanged in the initial state, it appears to imply that `beauty` has a pre-existing value. The output state will therefore reflect the increment of `beauty` and note that the other variables remain constant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 1`, `beauty` is incremented by 1.**
