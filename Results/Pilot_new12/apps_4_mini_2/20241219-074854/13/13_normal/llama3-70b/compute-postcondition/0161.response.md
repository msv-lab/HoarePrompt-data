The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'. After executing the function body, it processes the string `s` to produce an output based on specific conditions related to the characters in `s`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a string `s` of that length consisting of 'G' and 'S', and then to return a calculated result based on the content of the string `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and returns a result based on the processing of the string.**
