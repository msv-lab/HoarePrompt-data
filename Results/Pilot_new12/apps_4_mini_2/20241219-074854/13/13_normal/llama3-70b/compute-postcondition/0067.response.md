The values of `n`, `i`, and `s[j]` do not change due to the `break` statement, but it indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The value of `beauty` may have been updated to 2 if `s[0]` is 'G', or it remains 1 otherwise. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 1, `s[j]` is either 'G' or not 'G' for `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
