The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `curr_beauty` was some integer and is now `curr_beauty + 1`. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, and `left` still hold true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`; `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2`, where `k + 2 < n`; `left` points to the index of the first 'G' in `s`; `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.**
