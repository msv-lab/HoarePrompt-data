The variable `beauty` is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `s[i]`, and `s[i + 1]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of those variables along with the updated value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 1**
