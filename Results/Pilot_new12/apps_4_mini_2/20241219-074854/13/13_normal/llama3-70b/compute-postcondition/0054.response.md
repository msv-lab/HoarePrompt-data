The line of code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` assigns `max_beauty` the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state should reflect that `max_beauty` may have been updated based on the compared values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`; `curr_beauty` represents the beauty score of the last sequence of 'G's ending at the final character of `s`; `left` indicates the index of the last 'G' encountered before the end of the string; `right` is equal to `n - 1`.**
