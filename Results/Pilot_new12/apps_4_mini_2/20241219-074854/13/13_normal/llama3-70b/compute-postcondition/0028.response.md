The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected, and `left` now points to the next index after the first 'G' in `s`. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` must be modified such that `s[left]` is not 'G'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is now 1; `left` is updated to `left + 1`; `right` is at least 1; `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n`.
