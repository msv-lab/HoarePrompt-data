Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is 2; `s[j]` is either 'G' or not 'G' for `j` is 0; if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `s[0]`; otherwise, `beauty` is now equal to `beauty + 1`, and remains 1 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
