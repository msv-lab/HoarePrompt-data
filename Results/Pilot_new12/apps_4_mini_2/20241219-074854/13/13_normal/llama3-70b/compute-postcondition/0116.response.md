The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The conditions ensure that `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` remains at least 1, `n` is still greater than `i + 3`, and `j` is equal to `i + 3`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `j` is equal to `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `j` is equal to `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
