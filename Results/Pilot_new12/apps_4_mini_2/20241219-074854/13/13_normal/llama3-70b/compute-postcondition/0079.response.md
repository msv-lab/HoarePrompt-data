Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 4 if `i` is 1, or at least 5 if `i` is 2; `s` is the list of characters. If the character at index `j` in the list `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's found before `i` plus the initial value of 2. Otherwise, `beauty` remains the count of consecutive 'G's found before `i` plus the initial value of 1, and the execution exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
