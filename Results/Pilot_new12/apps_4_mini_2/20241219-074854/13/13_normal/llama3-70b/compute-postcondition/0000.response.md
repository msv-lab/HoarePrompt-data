The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input string representing an integer. The precondition states that `n` is an integer in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S' remains valid as its condition is not changed by this code segment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\; (n\; is\; now\; input\; integer) ; and the second input is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'.**
