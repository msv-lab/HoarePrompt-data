According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 2` and runs while `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration:

- `i` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`, so `n` must be at least `i + 2`.

In this case, since `j` is set to `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. After the last iteration, since `j` was `i + 2`, it would now be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `j` is now `i + 3` and `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`**
