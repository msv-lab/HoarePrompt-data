According to the code, the loop can execute if both conditions in the `while` statement hold true: `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`. 

1. The variable `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2`, where `k + 2 < n`. This suggests that `right` is greater than 1, which ensures that `left < right` can potentially be true depending on the value for `left`.
2. The variable `left` points to the index of the first 'G' in `s`. For the loop to continue executing at least once, `s[left]` must not equal 'G', meaning there should be a 'G' located at an index greater than `left`.

Given that `s` is a string consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', it is possible that `left` is currently positioned at an index of 'G'. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute the first time, `left` must be at an index where `s[left]` is 'S', indicating the absence of a 'G' at that position.

To summarize, for the loop to execute the first time, we need `left` to point to an index where `s[left]` is not 'G'.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2` where `k + 2 < n`, `left` must point to an index of 'S' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0**.
