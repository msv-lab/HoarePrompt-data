The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `curr_beauty` starts at 0, it will now be 1. The output state reflects this change, preserving the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0. The current value of `s[right]` is 'G'.**
