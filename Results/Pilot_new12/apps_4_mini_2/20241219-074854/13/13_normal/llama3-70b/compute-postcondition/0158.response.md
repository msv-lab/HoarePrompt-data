Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is an integer ≥ 1 and < `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, `beauty` is equal to 1 plus the count of consecutive 'G's starting from index `j` until a non-'G' is encountered, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, no operation is performed.***
