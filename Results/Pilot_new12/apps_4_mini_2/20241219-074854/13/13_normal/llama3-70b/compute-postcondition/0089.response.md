The code snippet updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` by taking the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. Since the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot deduce how it has changed quantitatively. However, we know that it is now equal to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `beauty` is the current count of consecutive 'G's; `j` is the last index checked; `s` is the list of characters; `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
