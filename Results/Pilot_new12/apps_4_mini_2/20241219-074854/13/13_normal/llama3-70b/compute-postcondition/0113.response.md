Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` increases by 1 based on the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` backward. Otherwise, `beauty` remains the same as it counts the consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` backward and `s[j]` is not 'G', leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
