The value of `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Before the execution, the value of `max_beauty` was 0 and `curr_beauty` remains 1. Therefore, `max_beauty` will be updated to 1, since max(0, 1) equals 1. All other precondition variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `curr_beauty` remains 1; `max_beauty` is now 1; `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`; `right` is at least 1; `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n**.
