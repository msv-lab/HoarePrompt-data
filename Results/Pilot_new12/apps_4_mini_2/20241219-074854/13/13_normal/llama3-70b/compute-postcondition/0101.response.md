The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The constraints on the variables remain intact. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
