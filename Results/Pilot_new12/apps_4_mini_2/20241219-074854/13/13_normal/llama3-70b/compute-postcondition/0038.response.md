According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `right` is less than `n`. Given that `right` is at least 1 and currently is `k + 1` (where `k + 1 < n`), `right` can increment to allow for the next iteration of the loop. After the last iteration, we need to set `right` to the next value, which will be `right + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `right` is at least `k + 1`, which means for `right` to be able to increment, `n` must be greater than `right + 1`. 

Thus, the conditions after the last completion should be adjusted as follows:
- `right` will become `right + 1` for the next iteration,
- `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, `left`, and the properties of `s` should remain unchanged as they are not directly impacted by the increment of `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2`, where `k + 2 < n`, and `left` points to the index of the first 'G' in `s`.**
