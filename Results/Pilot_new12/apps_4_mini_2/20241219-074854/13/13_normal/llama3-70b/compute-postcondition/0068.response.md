Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 1, and `s[j]` is either 'G' or not 'G' for `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `s[0]`. Otherwise, `beauty` remains 1 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
