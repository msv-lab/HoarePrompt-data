According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop starts at `i - 1` and decrements to `0`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it is greater than or equal to `1` and less than `n - 2`. The starting value for `j` in the next iteration will be `i - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `1`, since the loop will start with `j` at `i - 1`. If `i` is equal to `1`, the loop will not execute again because `j` will start at `0` and will break out immediately after that iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be at least `2`, meaning `j` can start from `1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is `i - 1`.**
