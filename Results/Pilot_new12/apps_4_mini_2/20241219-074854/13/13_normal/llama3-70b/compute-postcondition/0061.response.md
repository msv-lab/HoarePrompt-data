The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was 1, so the new value of `beauty` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is now 2, and `s[j]` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 2, and `s[j]` is 'G'**.
