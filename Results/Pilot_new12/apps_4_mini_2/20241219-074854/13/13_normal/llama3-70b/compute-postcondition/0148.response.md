According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 2` and increments `j` on each iteration as it goes through the range. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` should be `n`, since if the loop executes one more time, `j` will be initialized to `i + 2` and it needs to be less than `n`. Given that `i` is such that `1 <= i < n - 2`, we can conclude that `j` can be `n` or greater in order to execute once more. Therefore, for the loop to execute another time, `j` must be incremented to a value less than `n`. 

Currently, `j` should be `n - 1` for the loop to run one final time, so we need `n` to remain unchanged and `i` must be adjusted accordingly to ensure it complies with the constraints.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, and `j` is initialized to `i + 2` (where `j` can be `n - 1`).**
