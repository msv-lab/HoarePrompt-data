The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` backward; `s[j]` is not 'G' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
