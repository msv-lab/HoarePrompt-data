Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`; `beauty` is equal to 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from index `j` until a non-'G' is encountered. If `s[j]` is not 'G' on the first check, `beauty` remains the original value based on `i`.**
