The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s[0]`, and `right`) are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `left` is increased by 1 while keeping the conditions for the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s[0]` is 'S'; `right` is at least 1; `left` is increased by 1**.
