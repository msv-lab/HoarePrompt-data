The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `s[0]` is 'G' or not. After the increment, if `s[0]` is 'G', `beauty` becomes 3; if `s[0]` is not 'G', `beauty` becomes 2. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 1, `s[j]` is either 'G' or not 'G' for `j` is 0, and `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `s[0]**.
