Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, and `j` is initialized to `i + 2`. If the character at index `j` in the string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j` is not 'G', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
