The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `s[j]`) remain unaffected, but it is important to note that `j` is initially set to `i + 2` and `s[j]` has a fixed value of 'G'. Thus, the states of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s[j]` remain valid but unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: 

`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, `s[j]` is 'G', and `beauty` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1.**
