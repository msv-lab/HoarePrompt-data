The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2` (where `j` can be `n - 1`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
