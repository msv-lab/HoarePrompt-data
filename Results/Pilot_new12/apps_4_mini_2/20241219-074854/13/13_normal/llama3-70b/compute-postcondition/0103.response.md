According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. Specifically, the loop index `j` starts at `i - 1` and decrements until it reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` is at least 1, meaning `j` was set to `i - 1`, which would be at least 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be at least 0 at the start of the next iteration. This means that after the last execution, `j` would have been decremented to -1, which would have been the termination point of the loop. Therefore, before the next execution attempt, `j` must be reset back to `i - 1`.

Given that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is at least 1, we can deduce that `n` does not require any adjustment here, as it remains valid.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` remains unchanged**
