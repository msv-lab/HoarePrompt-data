According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop begins at `j = i + 2` and continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given that `i` must be less than `n - 2`, this means that `i + 2` will always be less than `n`, ensuring that the range for `j` has at least one valid value. 

At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, and since `i` is constrained such that it is at least 1 and less than `n - 2`, we can confirm that:
- `j` will be at least 1 + 2 = 3 (when `i` is at its minimum value of 1)
- `j` will always be less than `n` since `i + 2` will be less than `n` by the stated constraints.

Thus, the states that need adjustments for the loop to execute are `j` being initialized to `i + 2` which is valid, and since `n` satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to 2, we can state these conditions explicitly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`**
