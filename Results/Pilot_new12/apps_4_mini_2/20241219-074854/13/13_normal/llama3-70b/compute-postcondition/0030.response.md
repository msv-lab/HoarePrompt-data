The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but `left` moves to the next index, which allows for a character at that index in `s` to be modified to something that is not 'G'. The specific values of the other variables are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s[left]` must be modified such that `s[left]` is not 'G'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is now 1; `left` is now `left + 1`; `right` is at least 1; `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n; s[left] must be modified to a character that is not 'G'**.
