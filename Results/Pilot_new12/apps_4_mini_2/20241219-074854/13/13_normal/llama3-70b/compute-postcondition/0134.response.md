The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
