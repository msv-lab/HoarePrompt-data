The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1, and the states of the other variables are not affected. The initial constraints for `n`, `i`, and `j` remain valid, so we keep those in the output state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5\); `i` is an integer \(\ge 1\) and \(< n - 2\); `j` is `i + 3`; `beauty` is increased by 1.**
