To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we must assess how the loop processes the string `s`. The loop examines each character in the string to track the beauty score associated with sequences of 'G' characters. 

The loop iterates over the length of `s`, and if `s[right]` is 'G', it increments the `curr_beauty`. If it encounters an 'S', it resets `curr_beauty` while potentially updating `max_beauty` based on the previous value of `curr_beauty`. The `left` index is adjusted to re-align with the next potential 'G'.

After the final iteration of the loop, we note the following key variables:

1. `max_beauty` will contain the maximum observed beauty throughout the entire string, representing the longest sequence of 'G' characters encountered.
2. `curr_beauty` will be incremented for any ongoing sequence of 'G's that does not end with an 'S'.
3. The variables `left` and `right` will have traversed the string, with `left` possibly being near the last occurrence of 'G'.

Given these considerations, after the loop finishes executing, we have:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters found in `s`; `curr_beauty` represents the beauty score of the last sequence of 'G's ending at the final character of `s`; `left` indicates the index of the last 'G' encountered before the end of the string, and `right` is equal to `n - 1`.**
