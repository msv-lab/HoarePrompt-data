The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial constraints state that `left` is updated to a new index of an 'S' in `s` and must be less than `right - 1`. Since we are increasing `left` by 1, the updated state is: `left` becomes `left + 1`. Other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`; `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2` where `k + 2 < n`; `left` is now `left + 1` and `s[left]` is an 'S'; `left` is less than `right - 1**
