The code contains a `break` statement, which typically exits the most internal loop or conditional block. Since we are not provided with any additional context, we will assume that the previous values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` are unaffected apart from the control flow.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `i - 1`, `beauty` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
