According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, which indicates that it will execute `n` times in total, from `right = 0` to `right = n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is at least 1 (since it checks the character at index `right`), which means that the loop can execute again only if `right` is less than `n - 1`. 

Since the given conditions mention the potential states involving `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, and the indices of 'G', we need to adjust `right` for this next execution. If `right` is currently at `k`, it will increase to `k + 1` for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be adjusted to `k + 1`, and since `right` will not exceed `n - 1`, we must ensure that `k + 1` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` remains 1, `max_beauty` remains 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 1, `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n`**
