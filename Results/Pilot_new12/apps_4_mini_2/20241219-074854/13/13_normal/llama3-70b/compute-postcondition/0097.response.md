The code contains a `break` statement, which interrupts the most internal loop that it is part of. This means that the control flow has exited from that loop without changing any variable values or states. Thus, the preconditions remain unchanged in terms of their specific values, but we note that the loop has been exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 1, `j` starts from `i - 1`, `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop.**
