The code snippet `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` updates the value of `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since `max_beauty` was initially set to 0, the possible values for `max_beauty` after the execution will either remain 0 or be updated to the value of `curr_beauty`.

1. If `curr_beauty` is greater than 0, then `max_beauty` will be updated to `curr_beauty`.
2. If `curr_beauty` is less than or equal to 0, then `max_beauty` will remain 0.

However, the problem doesn't provide the exact value of `curr_beauty`. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `max_beauty` could either be updated to a value `curr_beauty`, based on its initial value.

Hence, the variables that retain their values from the initial state are `n`, `s`, `golden`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is either `curr_beauty`, or remains 0 depending on the value of `curr_beauty`; `curr_beauty` is unchanged; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; the character at index `right` in the string `s` is 'S'.**
