According to the code, the range of the loop depends on both `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate starting from `i + 2` up to `n`. In the state after the previous iteration, if `i` is 1, then for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4 (since `j` would start from 3). If `i` is 2, then `n` must be at least 5 (as `j` would start from 4). 

Therefore, when the loop executes again: 

- If `i` is 1, `j` will be 3, and `n` must still be at least 4 (allowing `j` to be within range).
- If `i` is 2, `j` will be 4, necessitating that `n` be at least 5.

In both cases, the loop will start iterating with `j` equal to `i + 2`. 

Given that the character at index `j` in the list `s` can affect the value of `beauty`, it will need to reflect consecutive 'G's found before `i`. If the last character processed was 'G' or not, we would potentially set `beauty` differently, but we don't have the specific value from the previous iteration so we keep it general.

Thus, regardless of whether we've encountered 'G' or a different character previously, the states would be:

State: **`n` must be at least 4 if `i` is 1, or at least 5 if `i` is 2; `s` is the list of characters; j is 3 if `i` is 1 and `j` is 4 if `i` is 2; beauty is the updated count based on `G` or not.**
