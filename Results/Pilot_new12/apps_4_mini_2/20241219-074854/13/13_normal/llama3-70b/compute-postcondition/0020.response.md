The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state provides information that `left` is the index of the first 'G' encountered in the string `s`, `right` is at least 1, and `s[left]` is 'G'. The constraint that `left` is less than `right` and that `s[left]` is 'G' after the loop implies that `curr_beauty` is also a definable value. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 1, `s[left]` is 'G', and `curr_beauty` has been incremented by 1.**
