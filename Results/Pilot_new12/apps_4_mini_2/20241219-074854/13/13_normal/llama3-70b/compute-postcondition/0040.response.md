The code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` assigns to `max_beauty` the maximum value between its current value (`max_beauty`) and the value of `curr_beauty`. The variable `max_beauty` is being updated based on the comparison with `curr_beauty`. Other variables remain unaffected. The potential changes in `max_beauty` depend on the specific values of `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2`, where `k + 2 < n`, `left` points to the index of the first 'G' in `s`, and `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `curr_beauty`**.
