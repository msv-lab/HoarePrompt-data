The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5\), `i` is an integer \(\ge 1\) and \(< n - 2\), `j` is `i + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
