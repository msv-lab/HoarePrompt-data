The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables maintain their previous data without any changes. The value of `curr_beauty` now reflects this increment. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `right` if no 'G' is found, `s[left]` is 'G', `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`, `curr_beauty` is now 1 (incremented by 1), `max_beauty` is now 1, `right` is at least 1, `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n`, and the current value of `left` is less than `right`.**
