The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged since the code only affects `beauty`. 

The value of `n` remains within the range of 2 to 100,000, `i` is at least 1, and since `n` is greater than `i + 3`, it confirms that `j` equals `i + 3`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 3, j` is `i + 3, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
