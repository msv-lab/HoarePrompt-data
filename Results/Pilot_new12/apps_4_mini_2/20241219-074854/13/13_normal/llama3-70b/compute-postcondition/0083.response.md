Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 4 if `i` is 1, or at least 5 if `i` is 2; `s` is the list of characters; `j` is 3 if `i` is 1 and `j` is 4 if `i` is 2. If `s[j]` equals 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `beauty` remains the updated count based on whether `s[j]` equals 'G' or not, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
