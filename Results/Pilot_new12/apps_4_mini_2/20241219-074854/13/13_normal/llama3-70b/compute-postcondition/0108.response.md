According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 2` and continues as long as `j < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, it is necessary that `i + 2` is less than `n`. 

Since we are given that `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), and that \( n > i + 1 \), we can deduce that \( j \) must start with a value of at least `i + 2`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, the state needs to reflect that \( i + 2 < n \). 

Since `j` is initially set to `i - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `j = i + 2`, which is the starting point of the loop. Additionally, we know `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` backward, which may not affect the execution of the loop but is relevant for the state description.

Final adjusted state: 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i-1]` backward.**
