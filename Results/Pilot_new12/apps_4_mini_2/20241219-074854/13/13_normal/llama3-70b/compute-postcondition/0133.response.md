According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined for it. The loop is iterating from `i - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). Given that at the end of the last iteration, `j` starts at `i - 1`, and since `j` is decremented each time the loop executes, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must equal `i - 1` at the start of next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at `i - 1`, and the loop will reduce `j` by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to run one more time, `j` will need to be set to `i - 1` and we should ensure the loop condition will still hold.

There are no additional conditions to validate in this case, as the loop will always continue as there are valid values for `j` in the range specified until it hits `-1`. However, the wording of the task indicates we also consider the previous state of `beauty`, but since it is not specified, we will leave it as it was.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` is unchanged.**
