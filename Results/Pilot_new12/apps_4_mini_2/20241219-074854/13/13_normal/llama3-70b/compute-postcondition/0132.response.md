Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, and `j` starts at `i - 1`. If the element at index `j` of the sequence `s` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
