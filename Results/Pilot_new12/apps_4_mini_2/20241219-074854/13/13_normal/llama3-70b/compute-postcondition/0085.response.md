The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `j`) remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged conditions and indicates that `beauty` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 5 if `i` is 1 or at least 6 if `i` is 2; `s` is the list of characters; `j` is 4 if `i` is 1 and `j` is 5 if `i` is 2; `beauty` is increased by 1.**
