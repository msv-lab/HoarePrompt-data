`beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged according to the provided constraints, but their conditions are still valid. Specifically, since `n` > `i + 3`, `j` remains equal to `i + 3`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, `beauty` is incremented by 1**.
