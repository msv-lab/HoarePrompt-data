The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The constraints on `n`, `i`, and `j` still apply, and the condition about the element at index `j` of the sequence `s` being 'G' is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` starts at `i - 1`, the element at index `j` of the sequence `s` is 'G', and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` starts at `i - 1`, the element at index `j` of the sequence `s` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1**.
