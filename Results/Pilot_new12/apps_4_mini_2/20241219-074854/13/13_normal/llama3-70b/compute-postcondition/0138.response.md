The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of the variable `beauty` by 1. The states of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected, so we retain the original conditions they've been assigned.

Since `beauty`'s previous value is unknown and assumed to be defined, its updated value will now be one more than its last known state.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i - 1`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
