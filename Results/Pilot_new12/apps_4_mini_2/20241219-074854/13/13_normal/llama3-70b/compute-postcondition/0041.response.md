`curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. The current state of other variables, including `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `left`, and `max_beauty`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2`, where `k + 2 < n`, `left` points to the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0**.
