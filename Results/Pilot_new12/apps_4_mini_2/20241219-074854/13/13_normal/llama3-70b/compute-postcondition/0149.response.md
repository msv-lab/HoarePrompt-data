`beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the output state incorporates all the valid precondition information and the updated value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
