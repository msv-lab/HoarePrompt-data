The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` starts at `i - 1`, `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
