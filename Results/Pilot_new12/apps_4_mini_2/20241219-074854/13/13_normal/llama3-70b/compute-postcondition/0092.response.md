The value of `beauty` is assigned as `1`, and since the other variables `n` and `i` were not changed by this line of code, we can include their conditions in the output. Thus, the state remains largely the same except for the new assignment to `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is the incremented value (i + 1), `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 1**
