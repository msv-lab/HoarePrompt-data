In the provided code, `golden` is assigned a list of indices where the character 'G' appears in the string `s`. Given that `s` consists only of characters 'G' and 'S', the `golden` will contain the positions of all 'G' characters in `s`. 

The states of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as this operation only introduces a new variable `golden`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`.**
