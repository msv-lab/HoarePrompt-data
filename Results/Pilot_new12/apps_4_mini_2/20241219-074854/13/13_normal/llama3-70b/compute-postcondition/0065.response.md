According to the code, the loop iterates backwards starting from `i - 1` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, therefore the starting value for `j` in the next iteration will be set to 0 (`i - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`). 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is equal to or greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be at least 0.

Since `j` is currently 0 and it will decrease in the next step, a further condition must be considered. At this point, `j` will be 0, so the loop can still execute one more time. The value of `s[j]` must be known (although it's not explicitly stated after the previous iteration state), but it will be `s[0]` at the next iteration.

Now, if `s[0]` is 'G', then `beauty` would be updated to 2; if `s[0]` is not 'G', it remains 1 and will break out of the loop. Given the conditions provided, the loop would either execute one last time or stop based on whether `s[0]` is 'G'.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 1, `s[j]` is either 'G' or not 'G' for `j` is 0, `beauty` is updated to 2 if `s[0]` is 'G' otherwise remains 1**
