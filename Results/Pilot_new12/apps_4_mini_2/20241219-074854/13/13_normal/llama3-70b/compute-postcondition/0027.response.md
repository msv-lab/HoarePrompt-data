According to the loop, the execution requires that both conditions `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'` must be satisfied.

1. The variable `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, meaning at that point `s[left]` equals 'G'. 
2. The second condition `s[left] != 'G'` is not satisfied, given that `s[left]` is indeed 'G'.

Therefore, for the while loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `s[left]` is changed to something other than 'G'. 

Additionally, `right` must still satisfy the condition `left < right`. Since we are given that `right` is at least 1 and `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n`, we also know that `right` is currently valid.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is for the string `s` such that `s[left]` is not 'G'.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` must be modified such that `s[left]` is not 'G'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is now 1; `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`; `right` is at least 1; `right` is `k + 1` where `k + 1 < n.**
