To determine the output state after the loop executes completely, we have to analyze the final values of the variables involved after all iterations of the loop have been completed.

Given the initial state and the loop code, here’s how we can outline the output state after all iterations:

1. The loop iterates starting from `j = i + 2` up to `n - 1`. This means that the actual number of iterations is dependent on `n` and the value of `i`.
2. If there are consecutive 'G's starting from index `j`, `beauty` will increment for each 'G' found.
3. If a non-'G' character is encountered, the loop exits immediately.
4. Depending on the value of `i`, the starting index for `j` will differ, affecting how many times `beauty` gets incremented.

To finalize the output state concisely, we summarize the conditions based on the analysis done through the loops:

- If the loop never executes (if `n < i + 2`), then `j` doesn’t get initialized.
- The final value of `beauty` will be dependent on how many subsequent 'G's were encountered (if any) after the `i` position.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed completely is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from index `i + 2` plus the initial value based on prior 'G's; `j` is the last index checked (either `i + 2`, `i + 3`, or the index of the first non-'G' character, whichever is met first); `s` is the list of characters.**
