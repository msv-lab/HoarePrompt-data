The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 5 if `i` is 1 or at least 6 if `i` is 2; `s` is the list of characters; `j` is 4 if `i` is 1 and `j` is 5 if `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
