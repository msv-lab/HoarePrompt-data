The code contains a `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement that it is currently in. Since there are no variable assignments or computations, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions remain valid: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `i` is at least `1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, and `j` is `i + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
