Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`; and `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2`, where `k + 2 < n`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `left` is at least the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `left` is less than `right`, and `s[left]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is again incremented by 1 while `max_beauty` remains unchanged, maintaining all other conditions.***
