Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `i` is the incremented value (i + 1) with `n` being greater than `i + 1`. If the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` in string `s` are 'G' and 'S' respectively, then `j` is in the range [i + 2, n), `beauty` represents the number of consecutive 'G' characters from `s[i]` onward until a non-'G' character is encountered, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to hold the maximum value between its previous value and `beauty`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
