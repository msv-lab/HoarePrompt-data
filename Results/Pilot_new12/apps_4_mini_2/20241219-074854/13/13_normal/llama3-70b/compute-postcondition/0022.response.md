Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', and `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1, with `max_beauty` remaining 0, and both `left` and `right` initialized to 0. Otherwise, if `left` is the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `right` is at least 1, and `s[left]` is 'G', then if `left` is less than `right`, `curr_beauty` has been incremented by 1.***
