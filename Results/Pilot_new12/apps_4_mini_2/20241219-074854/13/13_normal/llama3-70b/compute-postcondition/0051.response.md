Postcondition: ***`left` is at least equal to the index of the first 'G' in `s`, `left` is less than `right`, `s[left]` is 'G', `max_beauty` remains unchanged, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`, and `right` is at least 2 and is `k + 2` where `k + 2 < n`. The condition verifies that `left` is less than `right`, thus enabling the increase of `curr_beauty` by 1, while all other conditions remain unchanged.***
