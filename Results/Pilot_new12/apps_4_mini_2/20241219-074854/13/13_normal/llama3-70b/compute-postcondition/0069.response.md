According to the code, the loop is set to execute from `i - 1` down to `0`. Currently, `i` is 1, which means the loop will execute for `j` starting at `0`. The range for `j` in this case is `range(0, -1, -1)`, which technically includes only `j = 0`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase. Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2, and that would allow the loop to execute for `j` values of `1` down to `0` in the subsequent iteration, as the new range will be `range(1 - 1, -1, -1)`.

Since the current `s[j]` is 'G' or not 'G', we must also consider the implications for `s[j]` at `j = 1`. However, since this specific situation does not affect the condition for the loop since we are only updating for the next execution, we focus on the increment of `i`.

Thus, to be able to execute the loop one more time, we need `i` to be at least 2 for `j` to reach 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, and `s[j]` is either 'G' or not 'G' for `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `s[0]`. Otherwise, `beauty` remains 1 if `s[0]` is not 'G' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
