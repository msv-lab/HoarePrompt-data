The code increments the variable `left` by 1. The initial state includes the constraints on `n`, `s[0]`, `right`, and `s[left]`, which remain valid after this operation. Since `left` is being incremented, its previous value is unknown, but its new value will be `left + 1`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `s[0]` is 'S'; `right` is at least 1; `s[left]` must not be 'G'; `left` is increased by 1**.
