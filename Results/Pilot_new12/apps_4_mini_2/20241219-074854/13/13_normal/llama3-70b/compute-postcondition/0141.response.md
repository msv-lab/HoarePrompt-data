To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop finish, we analyze the loop code and the initial state of the variables step-by-step.

The final output state depends on how many consecutive 'G' characters exist in the sequence `s` starting from the index `i - 1` and moving backwards. The initial value of `beauty` is 1, which suggests that there is at least one beauty point already accounted for. If there are consecutive `G`s, the `beauty` will increase accordingly.

Considering the loop's logic:
- The loop will execute while `j` (starting from `i - 1`) evaluates elements in `s` going backwards.
- If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented.
- If `s[j]` is any character other than 'G', the loop breaks.

To understand the final state after completing all iterations, we can summarize it as follows:

1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1.
2. The loop continues to run as long as it encounters 'G' characters moving backward from index `i - 1` until it hits a character that is not 'G'.
3. After the loop finishes, `j` will be the index of the first character that is not 'G' or it will be -1 if all characters from index `i - 1` to 0 are 'G'.
4. By the time the loop has finished, `beauty` would have increased by however many 'G's were found before encountering a different character.

Given this, we consolidate the output state under the assumption that:
- `j` is the last index checked (either the first non-'G' or -1).
- `beauty` is the value accumulated based on the number of 'G's encountered, which adds to the initial beauty of 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `i - 1` backwards until a non-'G' is encountered, and `j` is the index of the first non-'G' character.**
