The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, and the character at index `j` in the string `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.
