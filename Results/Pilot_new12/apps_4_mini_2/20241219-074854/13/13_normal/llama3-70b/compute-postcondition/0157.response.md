In the given code snippet, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the value of `beauty`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `max_beauty_one_swap`, we denote it as its previous value before the operation (let's call it `previous_max_beauty_one_swap`).

During execution:
1. `beauty` is a function of `j`, which counts a consecutive sequence of 'G's starting from the index `j` until a non-'G' character is reached. 
2. If `s[j]` is not 'G' on the first check, `beauty` retains its initial value of `1` plus the number of 'G's counted based on the prior condition regarding `i`.
3. The existing value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is compared with `beauty`.
4. The maximum value between these two is stored back in `max_beauty_one_swap`.

Since the initial info about `max_beauty_one_swap` is not provided, we cannot set an exact new value, only that it has been updated. 

Variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` are unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is an integer >= 1 and < `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `i + 2`, `beauty` is equal to 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's starting from index `j` until a non-'G' is encountered; `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
