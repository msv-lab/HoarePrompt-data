To determine the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the provided information:

1. The loop iterates over a range that starts from `i + 2` and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. The loop's stopping condition is determined by whether the next value of `j` in `range(i + 2, n)` is less than `n`.
2. The values of `i` can be either 1 or 2 based on the previous iteration.
3. For `i = 1`, `n` must be at least 4. Thus, `j` would start from `3` (which is `1 + 2`) and can go until `n - 1`.
4. For `i = 2`, `n` must be at least 5. So `j` would start from `4` (which is `2 + 2`) and can go until `n - 1`.

From the previous state:
- If `i = 1`, at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to `4`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `5`.
- If `i = 2`, at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to `5`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `6`.

Given these evaluations:

State: **`n` must be at least 5 if `i` is 1 or at least 6 if `i` is 2; `s` is the list of characters; `j` is 4 if `i` is 1 and `j` is 5 if `i` is 2.**
