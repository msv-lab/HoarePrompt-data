You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and functionality, and consider various cases.

The task is to maximize the length of the longest segment of consecutive golden trophies ('G') after making at most one swap between trophies. 

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program correctly identifies segments of 'G' trophies and stores their start and end indices in the `segments` list.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no 'G's (i.e., all trophies are 'S'), the program correctly returns 0.
   - If there's only one segment of 'G's, it correctly returns the length of that segment without any swaps.

3. **Calculating Potential Max Length After Swaps**:
   - For segments that are separated by exactly one 'S', it calculates the possible extended length of 'G's by accounting for the segments before and after the 'S'.
   - It correctly adds one to account for the swap with the 'S' trophy if possible.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program returns the minimum of the calculated maximum length and `n`, ensuring it does not exceed the total number of trophies.

**Potential Test Cases**:
- **Case with no 'G'**: Input `3 \n SSS` should yield an output of `0`, which is correctly handled.
- **Already maximum length**: Input `4 \n GGGG` should return `4`, which is also correct.
- **Case with only one segment of 'G'**: Input `5 \n GGGSS` should correctly return `3`.
  
**Test a Non-Adjacent Swap Scenario**:
- Consider the input `5 \n GSSGG`:
  - There's one segment of 'G' from index 0 to index 0 and another segment from index 3 to index 4.
  - If we swap the first 'S' with one 'G', we can create the longest continuous segment of 'G's of length `5`. However, the logic does not account for swaps that are non-adjacent to merge segments beyond just one 'S'.

The program has a flaw where it doesn't properly handle the case of distant segments of 'G' separated by more than one 'S'. Consequently, this means it may miss larger potential contiguous segments when swaps are not next to each other.

**Example**: 
- For input `10 \n GSSGSGSSGG`, the segments are [(0, 0), (3, 3), (6, 6), (8, 9)]. If we swap the 'S' at index 1 with any 'G', we should be able to create one long segment, which the code does not achieve correctly.

Correctness: **False**. The program fails when trying to maximize subsegments where multiple non-adjacent swaps could be necessary to achieve maximum continuous 'G's. As such, it does not cover all cases as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies` consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies). It identifies contiguous segments of 'G' trophies in the string. The function returns 0 if there are no 'G' trophies. If there is only one contiguous segment of 'G's, it returns the length of that segment. If there are multiple segments, it calculates the maximum possible length of 'G's that can be formed, considering potential gaps of 1 ('S') between them, and returns the minimum of this maximum length plus one and `n`. Thus, the function effectively determines the maximum length of contiguous 'G's that can be achieved either from a single segment or by combining two segments separated by one 'S', while also ensuring the result does not exceed `n`. The edge cases considered include handling cases with no 'G's and ensuring that the maximum length does not exceed the input length `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
