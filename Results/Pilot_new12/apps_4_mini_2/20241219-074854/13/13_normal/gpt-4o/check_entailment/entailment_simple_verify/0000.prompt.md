You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input consisting of the number of trophies `n` and a string of characters representing whether each trophy is Golden (`G`) or Silver (`S`).

2. **Segment Identification**: The program uses a while loop to identify segments of consecutive golden trophies (`G`) and stores their start and end indices in the `segments` list. This part of the program seems correctly implemented.

3. **Max Length Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum length of segments of `G` trophies:
   - It calculates the maximum length of a single segment of `G`.
   - If there is only one segment, it returns that length.
   - For multiple segments, it checks if there is a way to unite two segments of `G` by swapping a `S` that is exactly between them (i.e., there are two `G` segments separated by a single `S`). This part of the logic appears to account for one valid swap to maximize the length of a golden trophy segment.

4. **Return Value**: It ensures that the maximum length is not greater than `n`, which is correct since you cannot have more golden trophies than the total count.

However, let’s analyze potential edge cases that this implementation might not cover correctly:

- Consider the case when there are only two trophies and those are `SS`. According to the prompt, the function should return `0` since no swaps can lead to a segment of `G`. The implementation would correctly output `0` in this case due to checking `if not segments`.
  
- Another edge case is having only one `G`, for example, the string "GS", the expected output is `1`. This should also work as there will be only one segment "G".

Despite the overall logical structure appearing correct, there might be a corner case where the segments are separated but more than two segments of `G` are involved or regions that can be swapped need a more complex check for larger lengths than the program currently considers.

Testing the method with more edge cases might reveal nuances:
- For example, in "SGGSGG", the output is correct `4` as you can swap `S` and `G`.

Now let's search for a case where gaps between segments need more involved checks. If the program doesn't adequately account for larger sequences or overlaps unexpectedly through maximum checks, it can generate erroneous outputs.

Upon further testing and detailed consideration, it appears the program does check the main cases described in the problem prompt and handles swaps reasonably well without exceeding constraints. All tested edge cases seem to return expected results.

Thus, based on the current analysis and absence of discovered issues in the program, it functions correctly with respect to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy).

    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of all contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`.

    if (not segments) :
        return 0

    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length derived from the single segment of 'G's in the list of segments.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length derived from the segments in `segments`, and the length of `segments` is greater than 1.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `segments`, `max_length` is updated to the maximum possible value based on the lengths of discontinuous segments of 'G's, and `segments` is a list containing at least two tuples representing contiguous segments.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum possible length based on the lengths of discontinuous segments of 'G's.
