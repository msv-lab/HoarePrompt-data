You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and functionality, and consider various cases.

The task is to maximize the length of the longest segment of consecutive golden trophies ('G') after making at most one swap between trophies. 

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program correctly identifies segments of 'G' trophies and stores their start and end indices in the `segments` list.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no 'G's (i.e., all trophies are 'S'), the program correctly returns 0.
   - If there's only one segment of 'G's, it correctly returns the length of that segment without any swaps.

3. **Calculating Potential Max Length After Swaps**:
   - For segments that are separated by exactly one 'S', it calculates the possible extended length of 'G's by accounting for the segments before and after the 'S'.
   - It correctly adds one to account for the swap with the 'S' trophy if possible.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program returns the minimum of the calculated maximum length and `n`, ensuring it does not exceed the total number of trophies.

**Potential Test Cases**:
- **Case with no 'G'**: Input `3 \n SSS` should yield an output of `0`, which is correctly handled.
- **Already maximum length**: Input `4 \n GGGG` should return `4`, which is also correct.
- **Case with only one segment of 'G'**: Input `5 \n GGGSS` should correctly return `3`.
  
**Test a Non-Adjacent Swap Scenario**:
- Consider the input `5 \n GSSGG`:
  - There's one segment of 'G' from index 0 to index 0 and another segment from index 3 to index 4.
  - If we swap the first 'S' with one 'G', we can create the longest continuous segment of 'G's of length `5`. However, the logic does not account for swaps that are non-adjacent to merge segments beyond just one 'S'.

The program has a flaw where it doesn't properly handle the case of distant segments of 'G' separated by more than one 'S'. Consequently, this means it may miss larger potential contiguous segments when swaps are not next to each other.

**Example**: 
- For input `10 \n GSSGSGSSGG`, the segments are [(0, 0), (3, 3), (6, 6), (8, 9)]. If we swap the 'S' at index 1 with any 'G', we should be able to create one long segment, which the code does not achieve correctly.

Correctness: **False**. The program fails when trying to maximize subsegments where multiple non-adjacent swaps could be necessary to achieve maximum continuous 'G's. As such, it does not cover all cases as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy).

    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing the starting and ending indices of all contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`. If there were consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, then the segments will contain the corresponding index ranges; if there were no 'G' trophies, `segments` will be empty.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0

There is at least one tuple in `segments`, indicating that there are consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length derived from the single segment of 'G's in the list of segments.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is equal to `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length derived from the segments in `segments`, and the length of `segments` is greater than 1.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `segments`, `max_length` is updated to the maximum possible value based on the lengths of discontinuous segments of 'G's, and `segments` is a list containing at least two tuples representing contiguous segments.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum possible length based on the lengths of discontinuous segments of 'G's.
