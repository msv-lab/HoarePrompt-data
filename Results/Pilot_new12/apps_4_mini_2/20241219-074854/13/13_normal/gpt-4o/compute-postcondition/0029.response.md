According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the boundary defined by `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n`, and that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000.

Since `i` is less than `n`, it guarantees that the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed for `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered and verified is `i`, which must remain less than `n` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, and `i` is an integer such that `i` remains less than `n`**
