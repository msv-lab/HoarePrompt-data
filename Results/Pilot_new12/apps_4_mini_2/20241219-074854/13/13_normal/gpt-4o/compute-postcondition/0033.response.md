According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `trophies`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'` hold true.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` has been updated to `i + 1`.
- For the loop to run again, the new value of `i` must still be less than `n`, so `i` must be less than `n` (which is already between 2 and 100000).
- Additionally, `trophies[i]` needs to be 'G'. Since it was stipulated that `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G', this condition also holds.

Given that `i` was updated to `i + 1`, we need to ensure that after this increment, `i` must still be less than `n` and that `trophies[i]` is 'G' for the while loop to execute again.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
1. From the condition `i < n`, since `i` has been incremented, we need `n` to be greater than `i` after increment. Since the previous state had `i` incremented to `i + 1`, we need `n` to be greater than `i + 1`.
2. For the condition `trophies[i] == 'G'` to hold true, it must remain valid at this new `i`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (to satisfy `i < n`)
- `trophies[i]` must still be 'G' (as specified in the state).

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G'**
