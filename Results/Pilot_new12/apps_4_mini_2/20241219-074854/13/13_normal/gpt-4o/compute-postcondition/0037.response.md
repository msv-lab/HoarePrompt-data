The loop increments `i` while `i` is less than `n` and the value of `trophies[i]` is 'G'. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `start` is equal to `i`, `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G'.  
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` must be greater than the previous `i + 2`, `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G', `i` is increased by 1.  
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` must be greater than the new `i`, `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G', `i` has increased by 1.  

After the loop completes its execution, `i` will be equal to the smallest index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or equal to `n` if all trophies were 'G'. The value of `start` will equal the final value of `i`. If `start` was initially less than or equal to `n-1`, then there will be at least one 'G' trophy in `trophies` at `start`, otherwise the loop did not execute.

Output State: **'i' is the first index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or 'n' if all were 'G', 'start' is equal to 'i', and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length `n`.**
