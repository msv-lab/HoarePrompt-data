Given that `i` is 3, the code assigns `curr_start` and `curr_end` the values from `segments[3]`. The values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` depend on what is stored in `segments[3]`. The other variables remain unaffected in this snippet. 

Assuming `segments` is a list or similar structure where `segments[3]` contains two values, we will update `curr_start` and `curr_end` accordingly.

Since we do not have concrete values for `segments`, we will represent this generically.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `max_length` is updated based on the lengths from `segments[2]` and `segments[3]`, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[2]`, `curr_start` is assigned the first value from `segments[3]`, `curr_end` is assigned the second value from `segments[3]`.**
