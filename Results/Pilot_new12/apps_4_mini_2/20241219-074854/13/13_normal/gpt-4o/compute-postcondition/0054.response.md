To calculate the new value of `max_length`, we need to examine the existing values and how they contribute to it. 

1. The original value of `max_length` is not specified, but it’s being compared with a new calculated value.
2. `curr_end - curr_start + 1` represents the length of the current segment.
3. `(prev_end - prev_start + 1)` represents the length of the previous segment.
4. We also add an additional 1, which may account for a gap or separation between the segments.

Given that the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` is equal to 2, we can deduce:

- `curr_end - curr_start + 1` = (length of current segment)
- `prev_end - prev_start + 1` = (length of previous segment)

Thus we have:

- The difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` being 2 indicates that `curr_start = prev_end + 2`.

Thus, we can summarize how max_length will be calculated:

- The expression becomes:
  ```
  max_length = max(max_length, (curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
  ```

Updating the values of `max_length`, assuming it was initially 0 or some integer value that supports maximum calculation, we would arrive at:

1. New value for `max_length` is based on the new length calculations laid out above, but its exact value isn’t computable without specific numeric values for `prev_end`, `prev_start`, `curr_start`, `curr_end`.

Since we can't specify the exact numerical value for `max_length` without additional context but we know it will be either the previous `max_length` or some new computed value from the lengths:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `max_length` is updated based on the calculation and is now the maximum of its previous value or the sum of lengths of segments and gaps calculated.**
