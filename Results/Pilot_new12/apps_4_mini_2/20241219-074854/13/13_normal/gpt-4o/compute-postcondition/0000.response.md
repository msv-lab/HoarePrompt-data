The variable `segments` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state provides bounds for `n` and defines a string `trophies`, but they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state focuses solely on the newly assigned value of `segments`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' (golden trophy) and 'S' (silver trophy); `segments` is an empty list.**
