The variable `i` is incremented by 1, which means `i` now equals `start + 1 + 1`, resulting in `i` becoming `start + 2`. The preconditions regarding `n` and `trophies` remain valid, and the condition `trophies[start + 1]` still holds true since it was specified that it must equal 'G'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `start + 2`, and `trophies[start + 1]` must equal 'G'**.
