The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and since now `i` is increased, we can rewrite the condition for `n` to be `n` must be greater than the new value of `i + 1`, which is the previous value of `i + 2`. The condition related to `trophies[i]` being equal to 'G' remains unchanged and does not affect the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the previous `i + 2`, `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G', `i` is increased by 1**
