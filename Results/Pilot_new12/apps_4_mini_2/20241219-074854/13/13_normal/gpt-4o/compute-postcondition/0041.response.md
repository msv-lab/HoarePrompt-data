Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, and `i` is an integer such that `i` is either the first index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `n` if all were 'G'. The variable `start` is equal to `i`, and `segments` now includes the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `n`, and the character at the new index `i` of `trophies` is not known but may or may not be 'G'.***
