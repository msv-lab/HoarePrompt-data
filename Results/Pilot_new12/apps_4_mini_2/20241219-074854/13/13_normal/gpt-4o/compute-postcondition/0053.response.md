Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length derived from the segments in `segments`, `length of segments` is greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of `segments[0]`, `prev_end` is the second element of `segments[0]`, `curr_start` is the first element of `segments[1]`, `curr_end` is the second element of `segments[1]`, and the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` is equal to 2.***
