The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its condition of being at least 4 is still valid. The variable `trophies[3]` is still 'G' and is unaffected as well. Therefore, the output state is updated only for `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `trophies[3]` must be 'G', `i` is increased by 1**
