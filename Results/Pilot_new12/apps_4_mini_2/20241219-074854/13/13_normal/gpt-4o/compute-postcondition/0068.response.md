The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `trophies`. The integer `n` is constrained such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and the string `trophies` has a length of `n` consisting solely of characters 'G' (for golden trophy) and 'S' (for silver trophy). 

After executing the function body, the function will return one of three possible values based on the content of the string `trophies`:

- **Case 1**: If there are no 'G' trophies in `trophies`, it returns 0.
- **Case 2**: If there is a segment of 'G's present, it returns the maximum length derived from the longest contiguous segment of 'G's.
- **Case 3**: If there are discontinuous segments of 'G's, it returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` represents the maximum length of those segments.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` and return a value based on the presence and length of segments of golden trophies (G) within the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a string trophies, returning 0 if there are no 'G' trophies, the length of the longest contiguous segment of 'G's, or the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n` based on discontinuous segments of 'G's.**
