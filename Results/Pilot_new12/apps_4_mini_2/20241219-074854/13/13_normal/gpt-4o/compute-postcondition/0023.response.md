The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is equal to `start + 2`, so after the increment, `i` will be `start + 3`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `start + 3`, and `trophies[start + 2]` must equal 'G'**.
