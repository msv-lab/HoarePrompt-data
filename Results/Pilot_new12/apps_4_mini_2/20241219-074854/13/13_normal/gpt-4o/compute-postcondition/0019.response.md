The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the constraints, `i` must have been less than `n` prior to the execution. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be equal to `start + 1`. Since `trophies` must satisfy the condition that `trophies[i]` is 'G', this condition remains valid if `i` was previously a valid index. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the previous value of `i`, and `trophies[start]` must equal 'G'**.
