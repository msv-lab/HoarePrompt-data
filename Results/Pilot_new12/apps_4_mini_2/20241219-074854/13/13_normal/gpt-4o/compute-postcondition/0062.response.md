The line `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns the values from the list `segments` at the index `i - 1`, which is `2` (since `i` is `3`). This means `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values of `segments[2]`, which is a tuple. The initial values of `segments` are not provided, so we cannot describe the actual values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` after the assignment, but we know they are now set to these values. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `max_length` is updated based on the lengths from `segments[2]` and `segments[3]`, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[2]`.**
