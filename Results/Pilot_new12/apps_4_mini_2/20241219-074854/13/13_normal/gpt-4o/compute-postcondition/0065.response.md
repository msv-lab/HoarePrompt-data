Postcondition: ***`i` is 3; `max_length` is updated based on the lengths from `segments[2]` and `segments[3]`; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are taken from `segments[2]`; `curr_start` is the first value from `segments[3]`; `curr_end` is the second value from `segments[3]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, these values apply as mentioned.***
