The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` will be equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `start` is 0; and the first character of `trophies` at index `i` is 'G'.**
