The operation `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns the first and second elements of the tuple located at index `i - 1` in `segments` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. Given that `i` is 1, this means we are accessing the first element of `segments` (index 0).

Since `segments` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`, we can infer that:
- `prev_start` will be assigned the first element of the first tuple in `segments` (i.e., the start of the first segment).
- `prev_end` will be assigned the second element of the first tuple in `segments` (i.e., the end of the first segment).

No other variables are affected by this operation, so the output state will reflect the updated values of `prev_start` and `prev_end`, while retaining the information about the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length derived from the segments in `segments`, `length of segments` is greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of `segments[0]`, `prev_end` is the second element of `segments[0]`**.
