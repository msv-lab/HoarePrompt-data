`i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` remains less than `n`, after the increment, `i` will be valid and still less than `n`. The character at the new index of `i` (after increment) of `trophies` may or may not be 'G', but since the precondition states that the character at index `i` of `trophies` before the increment was not 'G', it implies that the condition for the new `i` does not violate the provided limits. The values of `n` and `trophies` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i` is now incremented by 1 and remains less than `n`, and the character at the new index `i` of `trophies` is not known but may or may not be 'G'.**
