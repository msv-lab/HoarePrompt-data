Since the code simply assigns the value of `i` to `start`, there is no calculation involved, and only the variable `start` is affected. The value of `start` becomes whatever the value of `i` was at the time of execution. The other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` must be less than `n`, `start` is equal to `i`.**
