Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and `segments` is an empty list. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` counts the consecutive 'G' characters from the start of `trophies`, making `trophies[i]` the first non-'G' character, or `i` is equal to `n` if all characters were 'G'; `segments` includes the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and the character at position `i` in `trophies` is 'S'.***
