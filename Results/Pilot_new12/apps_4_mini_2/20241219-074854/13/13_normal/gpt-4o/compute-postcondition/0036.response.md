The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which means that the previous value of `i` increases by 1, while `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`. The condition about `trophies[i]` being equal to 'G' is still valid as it does not change with the increment of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than the new `i`, trophies[i] must be equal to 'G', and `i` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new `i`, trophies[i] must be equal to 'G', `i` has increased by 1**
