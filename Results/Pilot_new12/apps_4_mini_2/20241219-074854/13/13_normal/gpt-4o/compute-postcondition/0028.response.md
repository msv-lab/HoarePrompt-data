Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, and `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n`. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` is the first index where `trophies[i]` is not 'G' or `i` is equal to `n` if all elements from `start` to `n-1` are 'G'; `trophies[start]` is 'G'; for every `k` in the range from `start` to `i-1`, `trophies[k]` is 'G'; `segments` now includes the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, and `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.***
