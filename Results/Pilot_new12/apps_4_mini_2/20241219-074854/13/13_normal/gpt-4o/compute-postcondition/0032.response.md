The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since it was previously specified that `i` is an integer such that `i` remains less than `n`, the new value of `i` will still be valid. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `start` is equal to `i`, and `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `start` is equal to `i`, `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G'**.
