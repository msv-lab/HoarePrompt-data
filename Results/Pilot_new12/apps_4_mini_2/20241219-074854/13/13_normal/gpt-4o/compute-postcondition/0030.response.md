The variable `start` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial preconditions indicate that `i` is an integer and remains less than `n`, which is also an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000. The value of `start` will be equal to the current value of `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length `n`; `i` is an integer such that `i` remains less than `n`; `start` is equal to `i`.**
