According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the value at `trophies[i]`. The loop can execute again if both conditions are satisfied: `i` is less than `n` and `trophies[i]` is equal to `G`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than the previous `i + 2`, which means that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` after `i` has been increased by 1.

Given that `i` has been increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must satisfy the condition that it remains greater than the new `i`. Additionally, `trophies[i]` must also be equal to 'G' at this new `i`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states to clarify these conditions.

State: **`n` must be greater than the new `i`, trophies[i] must be equal to 'G'**
