The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is an integer that is less than `n`, the new value of `i` is guaranteed to be within the bounds of 0 to `n-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and `trophies` continues to be a string of length `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `trophies` is a string of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than `n`, and the character at index `i` in `trophies` is not 'G'. The updated value of `i` is now `i + 1`.**
