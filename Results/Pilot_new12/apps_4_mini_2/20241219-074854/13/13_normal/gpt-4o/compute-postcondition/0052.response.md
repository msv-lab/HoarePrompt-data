The tuple `segments[i]` is assigned to `curr_start` and `curr_end`. The value of `i` is 1, so `curr_start` and `curr_end` take on the values of the tuple at index 1 of `segments`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updates related to `curr_start` and `curr_end`, while still retaining information about `i`, `segments`, `max_length`, `length of segments`, `prev_start`, and `prev_end`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of 'G's in `trophies`, `max_length` is equal to the maximum length derived from the segments in `segments`, `length of segments` is greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of `segments[0]`, `prev_end` is the second element of `segments[0]`, `curr_start` is the first element of `segments[1]`, `curr_end` is the second element of `segments[1]`.**
