To determine the correctness of the given program, I will analyze its logic against the requirements from the problem description.

The problem states that a ticket is lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The main function `func_1` iterates through possible segment lengths (from 1 to n-1), trying each possible segment length to create the `target_sum`.
2. For each segment length, it sums the first segment and then continues to sum the digits while checking if the current sum equals the `target_sum` for further segments.
3. If a valid partition is found (where the sum resets to zero and more than one segment is created), it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO' after exhausting all options.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Input Length**: Suppose `n=2` and the digits are `11`. This should return 'YES' as the segments `1` and `1` can be formed with equal sums.
2. **Empty Cases**: The program doesn't handle the cases explicitly when all digits are zero (`00000`), which should also be considered lucky as you can take as many segments as you need, all with a sum of 0.
3. **Unequal Segment Sums**: Consider input `23456`. This should return 'NO' as no partitions can sum to the same value.
4. **Repeated Values**: Inputs such as `585` where you might split the segments as `5`, `8`, and `5` may yield that they can not be split with equal sums.

### Testing:
1. For **input**: `2` and `11`: The output should be 'YES'.
2. For **input**: `5` and `00000`: The output should be 'YES' because we can segment it into any number of zeros.
3. For **input**: `5` and `23456`: The output should be 'NO'.
4. For **input**: `3` and `585`: Should output 'YES' as it can form the segments `5`, `8`, and `5`.

Let's run these through the program:

1. **Input:** `2` and `11`
    - Current logic runs correctly and finds segments. Expected result is 'YES'.
    
2. **Input:** `5` and `00000`
    - This case is problematic. The current logic checks that each segment length checks if it can partition correctly. However, there are no checks on whether all segments can sum to zero.
    
3. **Input:** `5` and `23456`
    - This also runs correctly and expects 'NO', hence aligns with logic.

4. **Input:** `3` and `585`
    - The output is expected 'YES', as `segment_sum` correctly identifies those splits.

### Conclusion:
The function does not properly handle special cases, particularly when segments could all be zero. This indicates that while certain inputs may align, there are others where it fails to direct equal value segments.

Correctness: **False**. The program fails for empty segments and scenarios where digits can collapse uniquely into zero.
