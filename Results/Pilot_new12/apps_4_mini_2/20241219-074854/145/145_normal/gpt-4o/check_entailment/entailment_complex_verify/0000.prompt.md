You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program for identifying "lucky" tickets, we need to closely examine the logic used in the provided implementation.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Outer Loop**: The first loop iterates over possible segment lengths. It tries to find a target sum based on segments of length `segment_length`.

2. **Target Sum Calculation**: For each segment length, it calculates the target sum by calling `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, which sums the first `segment_length` digits of the ticket.

3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop iterates over the ticket's digits, aggregating their values into `current_sum`. When `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, it resets `current_sum` to zero and increments the `segment_count`.

4. **Final Check**: At the end of the inner loop, it checks if `current_sum` is zero (indicating that all digits were properly accounted for) and that more than one segment was found (i.e., `segment_count > 1`).

### Potential Issue:

- The code assumes that if `target_sum` can be found multiple times, then the digits can necessarily be segmented into valid groups. However, this is not ensured by the implementation. 

### Example Case to Test the Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
5
75000
```
- The ticket can be divided as `7`, `5`, `0`, `0`, `0`. Here, the digit sums are `7 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12`, but there is no possible way to divide these parts into two segments of equal sums greater than zero. 

### Program's Output:
- The expected output for the above case should be `NO`, as it cannot be split into valid segments with equal sums. 

If we step through the score:
- For any segment length where we calculate `target_sum`, the segments formed might not add up to the required sums, especially if zeros exist which do not contribute to the segment sums but exist in the ticket.
- The program currently does not handle cases where segments may incorrectly overlap or cannot be validly constructed, despite having some digits contributing to the target sums.

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation does not comprehensively check for all edge cases, notably it misses scenarios where valid segmentations cannot be formed. 

Therefore, based on the analysis and potential counterexample identified:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100, and ticket is a string of length n composed of digits where each digit ai is an integer between 0 and 9.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1 or less, `target_sum` is the last value calculated for `segment_length` being `n-1`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (ranging from 2 to 100) and a string `ticket` of length `n` composed of digits (0 to 9). It evaluates whether the string can be divided into contiguous segments, where each segment's sum equals a target sum derived from the initial segment of length `segment_length`, iterating through possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`. If it finds that more than one segment can be formed with sums equal to this target sum (with the condition that the final `current_sum` is zero), it returns 'YES'. If no such segmentation is found after all possible lengths are examined, it returns 'NO'. 

The final state of the program indicates either a successful segmentation into multiple parts with a zero remainder (indicating that the string can be evenly partitioned) or the absence of such a partitioning, concluding with a 'NO' response. Potential edge cases include scenarios where all digits in `ticket` are zeros or where no segments of sufficient criteria can be formed, leading to a definitive 'NO' response. In cases where `n` is at its minimum, the function must still properly handle and evaluate the string. Additionally, it does not account for varying digit sums leading to different outcomes based on distribution in segments.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits where n is the length of the string and 2 <= n <= 100. Each character in ticket is a digit between '0' and '9'. The indices start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < n.
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the substring of 'ticket' from index 'start' to index 'end', where 'ticket' is a string of digits and the digits are converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers that define the range of indices in a string `ticket`, which is a sequence of digits. It computes and returns the sum of the integer values of the characters in the substring of `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. The function operates under the assumption that the indices are within bounds (0 <= start <= end < n, where n is the length of the string). However, the code does not handle cases where `start` or `end` are out of bounds or where `ticket` might not be defined, which could lead to runtime errors. In a standard use case, if these indices are correct, the function will return the sum correctly as described.
