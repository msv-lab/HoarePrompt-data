You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, I will analyze its logic against the requirements from the problem description.

The problem states that a ticket is lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The main function `func_1` iterates through possible segment lengths (from 1 to n-1), trying each possible segment length to create the `target_sum`.
2. For each segment length, it sums the first segment and then continues to sum the digits while checking if the current sum equals the `target_sum` for further segments.
3. If a valid partition is found (where the sum resets to zero and more than one segment is created), it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO' after exhausting all options.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Input Length**: Suppose `n=2` and the digits are `11`. This should return 'YES' as the segments `1` and `1` can be formed with equal sums.
2. **Empty Cases**: The program doesn't handle the cases explicitly when all digits are zero (`00000`), which should also be considered lucky as you can take as many segments as you need, all with a sum of 0.
3. **Unequal Segment Sums**: Consider input `23456`. This should return 'NO' as no partitions can sum to the same value.
4. **Repeated Values**: Inputs such as `585` where you might split the segments as `5`, `8`, and `5` may yield that they can not be split with equal sums.

### Testing:
1. For **input**: `2` and `11`: The output should be 'YES'.
2. For **input**: `5` and `00000`: The output should be 'YES' because we can segment it into any number of zeros.
3. For **input**: `5` and `23456`: The output should be 'NO'.
4. For **input**: `3` and `585`: Should output 'YES' as it can form the segments `5`, `8`, and `5`.

Let's run these through the program:

1. **Input:** `2` and `11`
    - Current logic runs correctly and finds segments. Expected result is 'YES'.
    
2. **Input:** `5` and `00000`
    - This case is problematic. The current logic checks that each segment length checks if it can partition correctly. However, there are no checks on whether all segments can sum to zero.
    
3. **Input:** `5` and `23456`
    - This also runs correctly and expects 'NO', hence aligns with logic.

4. **Input:** `3` and `585`
    - The output is expected 'YES', as `segment_sum` correctly identifies those splits.

### Conclusion:
The function does not properly handle special cases, particularly when segments could all be zero. This indicates that while certain inputs may align, there are others where it fails to direct equal value segments.

Correctness: **False**. The program fails for empty segments and scenarios where digits can collapse uniquely into zero.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers that define the range of indices in a string `ticket`, which is a sequence of digits. It computes and returns the sum of the integer values of the characters in the substring of `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, inclusive. The function operates under the assumption that the indices are within bounds (0 <= start <= end < n, where n is the length of the string). However, the code does not handle cases where `start` or `end` are out of bounds or where `ticket` might not be defined, which could lead to runtime errors. In a standard use case, if these indices are correct, the function will return the sum correctly as described.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
