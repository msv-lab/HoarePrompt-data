The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`, overwriting its previous value, which was equal to `target_sum`. Since `target_sum` was equal to `current_sum` before this line of code, it is now reset to `0`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100; `i` is 0; `current_sum` is 0.**
