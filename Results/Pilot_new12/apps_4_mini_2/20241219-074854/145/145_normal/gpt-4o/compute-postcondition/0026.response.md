The value of `current_sum` is assigned as 0, which explicitly sets it to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial value of `current_sum` was not specified before this operation, but now it is clearly defined as 0. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is the number of segments that sum to `target_sum`; `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`**.
