The `segment_count` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`n`, `current_sum`, `target_sum`, `i`) remain unchanged. Since `segment_count` was initially 0, after the operation it will become 1. The values for the other variables stay the same. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
