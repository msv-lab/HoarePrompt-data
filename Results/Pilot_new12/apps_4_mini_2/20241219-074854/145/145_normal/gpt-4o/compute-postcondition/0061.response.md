The variable `segment_count` is incremented by 1, altering its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, and `i` is 1.
