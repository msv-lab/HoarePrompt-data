The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters: `start` and `end`. Both `start` and `end` are non-negative integers and represent valid indices within the string `ticket`, which is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100. The function returns the sum of the digits in the substring of `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`, where the digits are converted to integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `segment_sum` is to accept two indices, `start` and `end`, and return the sum of the integer values of the digits in the substring of `ticket` specified by these indices.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `start` and `end`, which are non-negative integers, and returns the sum of the digits in the substring of `ticket` from index `start` to index `end`.**
