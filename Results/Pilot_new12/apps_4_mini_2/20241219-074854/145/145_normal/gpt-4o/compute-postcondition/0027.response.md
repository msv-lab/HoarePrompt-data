The statement `segment_count = 0` assigns a value of 0 to the variable `segment_count`. The previous value of `segment_count` is not provided, but it can be inferred that `segment_count` previously held some number related to the count of segments summing to `target_sum`. The other variables (`n`, `current_sum`, `target_sum`) remain unaffected by this assignment, and the relevant states of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is 0; `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`**
