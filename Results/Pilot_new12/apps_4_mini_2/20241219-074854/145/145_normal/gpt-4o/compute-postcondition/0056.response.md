The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 0, so after the execution, `segment_count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`current_sum`, `target_sum`, `n`, `segment_length`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 0**
