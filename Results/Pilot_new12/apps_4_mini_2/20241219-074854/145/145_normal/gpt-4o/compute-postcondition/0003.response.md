The variable `segment_count` is initialized to 0. The previous states of the variables `n`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of segment_sum(0, 0), `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the result of segment_sum(0, 0), `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
