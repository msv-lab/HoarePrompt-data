After executing the code `current_sum = 0`, the variable `current_sum` is directly assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum`, which was `0 + int(ticket[2])`, is now overridden. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
