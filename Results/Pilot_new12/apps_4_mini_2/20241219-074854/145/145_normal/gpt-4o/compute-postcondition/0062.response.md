Postcondition: ***`current_sum` is equal to `2 * int(ticket[1])`, `segment_count` is 1, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, and `i` is 1. If `current_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased to 2, `target_sum` remains equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `n` is still between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2, and `i` is 1.***
