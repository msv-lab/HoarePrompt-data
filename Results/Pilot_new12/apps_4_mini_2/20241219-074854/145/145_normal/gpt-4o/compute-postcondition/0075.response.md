Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (ranging from 2 to 100) and a string `ticket` of length `n` composed of digits (0 to 9). It evaluates whether the string can be divided into contiguous segments, where each segment's sum equals a target sum derived from the initial segment of length `segment_length`, iterating through possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`. If it finds that more than one segment can be formed with sums equal to this target sum (with the condition that the final `current_sum` is zero), it returns 'YES'. If no such segmentation is found after all possible lengths are examined, it returns 'NO'. 

The final state of the program indicates either a successful segmentation into multiple parts with a zero remainder (indicating that the string can be evenly partitioned) or the absence of such a partitioning, concluding with a 'NO' response. Potential edge cases include scenarios where all digits in `ticket` are zeros or where no segments of sufficient criteria can be formed, leading to a definitive 'NO' response. In cases where `n` is at its minimum, the function must still properly handle and evaluate the string. Additionally, it does not account for varying digit sums leading to different outcomes based on distribution in segments.**
