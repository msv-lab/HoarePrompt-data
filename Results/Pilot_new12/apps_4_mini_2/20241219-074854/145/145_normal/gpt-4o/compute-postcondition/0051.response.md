In this case, `segment_count` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `segment_count` could either be `1` or less, so now it will definitely be `0`, no longer fulfilling the condition of being `1 or less` in the same manner. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `n` is between 2 and 100, `segment_length` is 2**
