According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 100, and `i` remains 0, meaning it's ready for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1 to 1, and since `n` is still between 2 and 100, it will allow the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased to 1, `i` is 1**
