The value of `current_sum` is assigned to 0. This update overrides its previous value, which was `current_sum + int(ticket[2])`. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, and `segment_count` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` remains unchanged or increased by 1**
