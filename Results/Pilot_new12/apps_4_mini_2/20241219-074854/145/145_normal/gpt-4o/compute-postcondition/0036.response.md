The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state indicates that `current_sum` was being increased by `int(ticket[i])`, but this operation is interrupted by the assignment of `current_sum` to `0`. Thus, the value of `current_sum` is now exactly `0`. The remaining variables, `n`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`, and `i`, are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased to 1, `i` is 1**
