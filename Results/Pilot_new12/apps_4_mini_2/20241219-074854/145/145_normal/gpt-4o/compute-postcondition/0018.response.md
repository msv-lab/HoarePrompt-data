The value of `segment_count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` remains unchanged (or possibly increased). The values of `n`, `i`, and `current_sum` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100; `i` is 2; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100; `i` is 2; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is increased by 1.**
