In the provided code snippet, `current_sum` is set to 0, which directly changes its value. The other variables remain unaffected, and we keep the relationships and conditions intact.

The previous state indicates that `current_sum` was equal to `int(ticket[0])`, but now it is explicitly changed to 0. Accordingly, `target_sum` remains the same because it is stated that `current_sum` is currently equal to `target_sum`. Thus, `target_sum` also becomes 0.

The output state after executing the code is:
- `n` is between 2 and 100,
- `current_sum` is 0,
- `segment_count` is 0,
- `target_sum` is 0 (as it equals `current_sum`),
- `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `i` is 0.**
