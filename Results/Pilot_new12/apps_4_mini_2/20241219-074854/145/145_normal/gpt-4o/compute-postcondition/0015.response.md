According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is between 2 and 100. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `current_sum` could be equal to or not equal to `target_sum`, `segment_count` remains unchanged or increased by 1**
