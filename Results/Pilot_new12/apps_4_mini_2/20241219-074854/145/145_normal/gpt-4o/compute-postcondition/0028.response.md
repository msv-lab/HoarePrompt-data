According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is defined to be between 2 and 100. The values that are particularly relevant for this loop are `i`, which will range from 0 to `n-1`, and `n` itself, which guarantees that the loop will run as long as it's within the specified range. The state before the loop starts indicates that `current_sum`, `segment_count`, and `target_sum` are not directly involved in the loop control but may be used in the loop body.

Since `n` is already guaranteed to be within the valid range for the loop to execute, we can conclude that at the start of the first iteration, `i` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1), i is 0`**
