The code `segment_count += 1` increments the value of `segment_count` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `current_sum`) remain unchanged. It is noted that `segment_count` could either remain unchanged or increase by 1 depending on whether the previous `current_sum` equals `target_sum`. However, without specific information regarding `current_sum` or `target_sum`, we only state that `segment_count` has definitely increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased by 1**
