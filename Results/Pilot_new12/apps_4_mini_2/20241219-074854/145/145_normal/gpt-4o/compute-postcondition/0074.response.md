The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. `n` is an integer constrained between 2 and 100, and `ticket` is a string of length `n` composed of digits, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9. 

After executing the function body, the function can return the following based on the state of the variables:

- **Case 1:** It returns 'YES', indicating a successful evaluation related to segments that sum to 'target_sum', where `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is greater than 1.
- **Case 2:** It returns 'YES', indicating that there is a successful condition met with the current state of variables, where `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is greater than 1, and `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, which is greater than 1.
- **Case 3:** It returns 'YES', with the state that includes `segment_count` being greater than 1, `target_sum` equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`, `current_sum` being 0, and `segment_length` equal to 2, while `n` is between 2 and 100.
- **Case 4:** It returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket` and evaluate conditions based on their state to return either 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and a string `ticket` (of length `n` composed of digits). It returns 'YES' under specific conditions based on segment sums, or 'NO' otherwise.**
