`segment_count` is incremented by 1, which will update its previous value. Since the initial state indicates that `segment_count` is already increased to 1, the final value of `segment_count` will now be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 1**.
