The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 2, so the new value is 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
