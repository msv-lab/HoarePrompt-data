The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `segment_count` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `current_sum` remain unaffected by this code. Thus, the output state is: `n` is between 2 and 100; `i` is 0; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100; `i` is 0; `current_sum` is 0; `segment_count` is increased by 1.**
