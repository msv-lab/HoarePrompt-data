#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), containing digits where each digit is in the range of 0 to 9.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because the current value of total_sum, which is the sum of the digits in ticket, is odd.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), containing digits where each digit is in the range of 0 to 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` which is an even number.
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of length `n` (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is an even number, and `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`. `curr_sum` is the sum of present digits in the last segment (could be less than `target_sum`), `segments` is the count of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if the count of segments where the sum of digits equals 'target_sum' is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `ticket`, which contains digits. It first computes the total sum of the digits in `ticket`. If this total sum is odd, the function immediately returns `False`. If the total sum is even, it calculates a target value which is half of the total sum. The function then iterates over the digits of `ticket`, accumulating a current sum. Each time the current sum matches the target sum, it resets and increments a segment counter. Finally, the function returns `True` if at least two such segments have been found; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function effectively checks if the digits can be divided into two or more segments, each summing to half of the total sum. 

Edge cases include scenarios where:
1. The input string has only two digits (the minimum allowed length).
2. All digits may be the same, leading to unique segment configurations, or
3. The string contains zeros that might affect the segment count but still adhere to the overall logic.
The function does not handle cases where characters are not digits or if the string is unexpectedly empty, but it assumes valid input according to specified constraints.
