The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits contained in the string `ticket`. Since `ticket` is a string comprised of digits (0 to 9), the resultant value of `total_sum` is the total of those individual digit values. The length of `ticket`, denoted as `n`, remains unchanged since the `sum` operation does not alter the string `ticket`. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), containing digits where each digit is in the range of 0 to 9; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
