The statement `segments += 1` increments the value of `segments` by 1. The previous state indicates that `segments` was 0, so after execution, `segments` will be 1. 

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to the integer value of `digit`, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first character of the ticket.**
