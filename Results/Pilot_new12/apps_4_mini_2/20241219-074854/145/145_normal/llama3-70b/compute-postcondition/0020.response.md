The value of `segments` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated count of `segments`. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n, `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to `int(digit)`, `segments` is incremented by 1**
