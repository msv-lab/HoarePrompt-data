According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `ticket` string. The loop will execute again for the next character in the `ticket`. At the end of the last iteration, `ticket` is a string of length `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is an even number, and `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`. If `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, then `segments` is set to 1, `curr_sum` is reset to 0, and `digit` is set to the first character of the ticket.

Since the loop processes each character in `ticket` sequentially, and if `curr_sum` is reset at some condition while `digit` is currently the first character (implying that the loop is at the start of processing the string), for the loop to continue executing for the next character, `digit` should take the value of the second character in the ticket and the loop should be set to move to the next index.

Thus, since we need to prepare for the next character in the loop:
1. `ticket` will be evaluated to include the next character.
2. `curr_sum` will be updated accordingly as the loop processes.

We need to adjust for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`ticket` is a string of length n, `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, segments is 1, `curr_sum` is 0, `digit` is the second character of the ticket.**
