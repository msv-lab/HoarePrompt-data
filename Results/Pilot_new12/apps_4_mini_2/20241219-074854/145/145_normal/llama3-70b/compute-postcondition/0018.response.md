According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digit` which is derived from the string `ticket`. The loop will iterate over each character in the `ticket`. At the end of the last iteration, `ticket` is a string of length `n`, and the loop has already processed the current character. 

Since `curr_sum` is updated to 0, the next character will be the next digit in the `ticket` string. As we are iterating over `ticket`, the loop will continue executing until all characters are processed. Since `ticket` has length `n`, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to be on the second character when `length` is greater than 1. We're currently positioned before the first character.

Therefore, the `digit` will now be the second character of `ticket`, and for the loop to execute one more time, it should be able to access up to the end of `ticket`.

State: **`ticket` is a string of length n, `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `digit` is the next character in the string `ticket`**
