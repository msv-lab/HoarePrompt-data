In the provided code snippet, `curr_sum` is updated by adding the value of `digit`. Given that `digit` is the second character of the `ticket`, it needs to be converted to an integer for the addition.

The initial state mentions that `ticket` is a string of length `n`, which implies it has at least two characters (since `digit` is the second character). The value of `digit` will depend on the actual second character present in the `ticket`. 

Since `total_sum` is an even number, this detail will not directly affect the execution of the line of code provided but is important context as it connects to `target_sum`.

Therefore, the new value of `curr_sum` can be represented as `curr_sum = 0 + int(digit)`, where `digit` is the integer value of the second character of `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n, `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, segments is 1, `curr_sum` is equal to `int(digit)`, `digit` is the second character of the ticket.**
