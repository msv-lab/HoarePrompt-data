The output state reflects the update that occurs when `curr_sum` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n, `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `segments` is 2, `curr_sum` is 0**.
