According to the code, the `for` loop will iterate through each `digit` in the `ticket` string. The loop will execute as long as the `ticket` string is not empty, which is guaranteed since `n` is at least 2. The key variables affected by the loop execution are the `digit`, so the state must reflect that the `digit` is the first character in the `ticket` string.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:

- `ticket` is a string of length n (with n being at least 2).
- `digit` should be initialized to the first character of the `ticket` string.
- The loop will begin with the first character of the string.

State: **`ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 0, `digit` is the first character of the ticket**.
