The value of `target_sum` is assigned as `total_sum // 2`, where `total_sum` is given to be an even number. This integer division will yield a whole number as `total_sum` is even. The value of `target_sum` becomes half of `total_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of length n containing digits, `total_sum` is an even number, and `target_sum` is half of `total_sum`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), containing digits; `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`.**
