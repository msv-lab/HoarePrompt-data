`curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first character of the ticket, and `curr_sum` is 0.
