`curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), containing digits; `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`; `curr_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n (2 <= n <= 100), containing digits; `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`; `curr_sum` is 0.**
