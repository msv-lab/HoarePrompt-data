To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the provided variables and their relationships:

1. `curr_sum` is initialized to 0.
2. `digit` is the next character in the string `ticket`, which may represent a numeric character (like '0', '1', '2', ..., '9'). It's important to note that `digit` needs to be converted into an integer to perform the addition.
3. The line `curr_sum += digit` means that we are adding the value of `digit` to `curr_sum`.

Considering this, if `digit` is a numeric character, its corresponding integer value can be represented as `int(digit)`. 

Thus, after the operation:
- `curr_sum` will be updated to `curr_sum + int(digit)`.
- Since `curr_sum` was previously 0, it will now equal `int(digit)`.

No other variables are changed by this operation.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of length n, `total_sum` is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to `int(digit)`, `digit` is the next character in the string `ticket`.**
