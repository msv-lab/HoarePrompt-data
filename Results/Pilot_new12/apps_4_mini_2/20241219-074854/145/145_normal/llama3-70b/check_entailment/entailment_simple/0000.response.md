Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description. Let's break down its functionality to confirm this:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of digits in the ticket, and then it reads `n` digits as a list of integers. This corresponds correctly to the problem description requirements.

2. **Even Total Sum Check**: The function `func_1` first calculates the total sum of the digits. According to the problem description, a ticket can only be considered lucky if its digits can be split into segments with equal sums, which is only possible if the total sum is even. The program checks if `total_sum` is odd and returns `False` if it is, correctly handling this aspect of the problem.

3. **Target Sum Calculation**: If `total_sum` is even, the program calculates `target_sum` as `total_sum // 2`, which is necessary for dividing the ticket into segments of equal sums.

4. **Segment Counting**: The program then initializes `curr_sum` to accumulate the sums of the current segment and counts how many segments equal `target_sum`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, it increments the `segments` counter and resets `curr_sum`.

5. **Final Check for Segments**: After checking all digits, the function returns `True` if at least two segments are found (i.e., `segments >= 2`). This matches the requirement in the problem description of finding two or more non-intersecting segments.

6. **Output**: The program ultimately prints "YES" if `func_1` returns `True` and "NO" otherwise, as specified in the problem.

In summary, the program handles all specified conditions and constraints in the problem description. It ensures to check for even sums, correctly accumulates quantities to find segments, counts them appropriately, and outputs the result in the expected format. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the task.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct in its implementation of the problem description.
