The provided program attempts to determine whether a given ticket (a sequence of digits) can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. Let's examine its correctness step by step in relation to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of digits and then reads the digits themselves, storing them in a list called `ticket`. This matches the problem description, which specifies that the input consists of a sequence of numerals of length `n`.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` begins by calculating the total sum of the digits in `ticket`.
   - If the total sum is odd, it correctly returns `False`. This is aligned with the problem description because an odd total cannot be split into two or more equal integer sums.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates `target_sum` as `total_sum // 2`.
   - The function then iterates through each digit, accumulating the `curr_sum`. When `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, it resets `curr_sum` and increments a segment counter.
   - Finally, the function returns `True` if two or more segments with the sum of `target_sum` are found.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program prints "YES" if `func_1` returns `True` and "NO" otherwise. This aligns with the requirement to output "YES" or "NO" depending on whether the ticket is considered lucky.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program appears to correctly handle edge cases concerning digit values (0 through 9). It avoids scenarios that would cause errors such as reading invalid input, given the assumptions we are working under.

Given our analysis, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases specified by the constraints. Thus, the program returns the correct results for any valid input according to the outlined requirements.

Correctness: **True**
