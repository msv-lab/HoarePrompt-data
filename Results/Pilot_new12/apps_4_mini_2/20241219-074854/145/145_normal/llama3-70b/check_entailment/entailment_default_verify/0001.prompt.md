You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case where the sum of all segments can equal the same value while still allowing for the possibility of overlapping digits or non-ideal segments. For example, take the input:

```
5
00123
```

In this case, the total sum is `0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is even. The target sum is `3`. However, the function does not find any two non-overlapping segments that can sum to `3` because it only considers total sums that are reached without overlapping, neglecting the potential for segments that might need to use zeros explicitly.

The segmentation isn't strictly enforced because if the segments draw upon the same parts of numbers and use zeros effectively, the algorithm fails. The segments could be `0, 0, and 1,2` or similar, and hence the function returns `NO`, when it actually should return `YES`. 

Therefore, because the program does not handle this case properly, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `ticket`, which contains digits. It first computes the total sum of the digits in `ticket`. If this total sum is odd, the function immediately returns `False`. If the total sum is even, it calculates a target value which is half of the total sum. The function then iterates over the digits of `ticket`, accumulating a current sum. Each time the current sum matches the target sum, it resets and increments a segment counter. Finally, the function returns `True` if at least two such segments have been found; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function effectively checks if the digits can be divided into two or more segments, each summing to half of the total sum. 

Edge cases include scenarios where:
1. The input string has only two digits (the minimum allowed length).
2. All digits may be the same, leading to unique segment configurations, or
3. The string contains zeros that might affect the segment count but still adhere to the overall logic.
The function does not handle cases where characters are not digits or if the string is unexpectedly empty, but it assumes valid input according to specified constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
