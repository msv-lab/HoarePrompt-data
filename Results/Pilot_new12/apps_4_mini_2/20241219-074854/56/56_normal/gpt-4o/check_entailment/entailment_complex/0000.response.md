To determine the correctness of the annotated program in relation to the given problem description, we can follow these points:

1. **Initial Condition Check**: The function first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If `k > n`, it correctly returns "No", because it is not possible to create a sum of `k` parts (each being a power of 2) that equals `n`.

2. **Bit Extraction**: The program correctly extracts the indices of the bits that are set (1) in the binary representation of `n` and stores these in a list called `bits`. This accurately reflects which powers of 2 contribute to the sum of `n`.

3. **Length Check**: The function also checks if the number of set bits (the length of `bits`) exceeds `k`. If it does, then it returns "No", which is correct since it is not possible to represent `n` with more bits than allowed.

4. **Extending the List**: If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the function enters a while loop, where it pops the smallest index in `bits` and appends this index decremented by one twice. This means it is effectively splitting an existing power of two into two smaller powers, which is valid in the context of creating more terms to satisfy the sequence length `k`. This approach cleverly maintains the total sum while increasing the number of terms, aligning with the problem's requirement.

5. **Sorting and Output**: The final step sorts the `bits` in descending order before presenting them. This fulfillment of creating the lexicographically largest sequence is crucial, as the problem requests the output to be in that order.

6. **Final Output Form**: The function returns "Yes", followed by the space-separated list of integers, which correctly matches the output specification of the problem.

Overall, the function handles all specified cases effectively and adheres to the constraints laid out in the problem description. The algorithm ensures that any possible cases of having a valid sequence `k` integers summing to `n`, while keeping the largest integer as small as possible and outputting the sequence in the required order.

Considering all these points, the program fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
