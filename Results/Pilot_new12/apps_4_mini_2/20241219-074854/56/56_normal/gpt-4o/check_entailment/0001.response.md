Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `k`. For example, if we take the input:

```
n = 2
k = 3
```

In this case, the output should be "No" since it's impossible to represent 2 as a sum of 3 distinct powers of two (or even negative powers to meet the required sum). However, the program would return "Yes\n-1 -1 -1", which is incorrect because:

- The initial condition doesn't account for the possibility of distributing the value of `n` into powers of 2 over `k` slots correctly in every case.
- The program assumes that it can always split existing bit positions into smaller bits without considering whether the total `k` can indeed represent `n` fairly.

Thus, the logic falls short in certain scenarios leading to incorrect outputs. 

In summary, the program fails to account for certain edge cases regarding the value of `n` relative to `k`.
