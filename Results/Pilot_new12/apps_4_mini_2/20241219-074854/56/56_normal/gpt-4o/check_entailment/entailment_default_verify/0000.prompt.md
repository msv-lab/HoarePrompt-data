You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program creates a sequence of integers whose powers of two sum to `n` and checks if the number of elements in the sequence is at least `k`. However, it misses some important checks and adjustments:

1. When `k` is greater than the number of bits used in `n`, the program simply returns "No". While this is correct for most cases, it doesn't handle the scenario where `k` could still be created using negative powers correctly.

2. The manner in which it duplicates the smallest bit when the total number of bits is less than `k` can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, if `k` is greater than the number of bits in `n`, it adds duplicates, but this may not always satisfy the conditions given. 

3. The program also does not properly handle cases like the following:
   - If `n = 1` and `k = 2`, it should return "Yes" and the sequence `-1 -1` (which is handled correctly), but for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, it cannot produce two entries while still summing to `2^0 + 2^0`, leading to it failing due to the way it handles bit expansion.

For example, if the input is `2 2`, it should return "No" since there are no valid k integers that can sum to `2` while preserving the required length of the answer. However, it will also not appropriately return "No" in cases like `7 3`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Thus, the program does not cover all edge cases, and its logic for creating valid sequences can lead to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), and `k`, a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). It performs the following actions: 

1. If `k` is greater than `n`, it returns 'No'.
2. It extracts the indices of the bits set in `n` (up to 60 bits) and stores them in a list called `bits`.
3. If the length of `bits` exceeds `k`, it returns 'No'.
4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, it appends additional bits by decrementing the smallest index until the length of `bits` equals `k`. This involves popping the smallest index and adding it back twice.
5. Finally, it sorts the `bits` in descending order and returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of the sorted list joined by spaces.

The function may also implicitly handle other cases where `k` can be equal to the number of bits set in `n`, allowing for the return of valid bit indices as output. If the situation arises where `k` can be satisfied without any need for additional bits (where `len(bits) < k`), then the inserted values will keep `bits`'s length exactly `k`. 

In conclusion, the final output could be:
- 'No' (if `k` > `n` or if the length of `bits` exceeds `k`),
- 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of `k` bit positions (if `k` ≤ `n` and `len(bits)` is exactly adjusted to equal `k`).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
