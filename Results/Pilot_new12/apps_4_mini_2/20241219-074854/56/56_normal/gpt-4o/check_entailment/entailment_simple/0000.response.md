To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the program logic step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Given two integers, `n` (the target sum) and `k` (the length of the sequence), the program must find `k` integers such that the sum of `2` raised to the power of each integer equals `n`.
2. The program needs to minimize the maximum integer in the result while ensuring the sequence is lexicographically largest among those that meet the first condition.
3. If such a sequence cannot be constructed, the output must be "No". If it can be constructed, the output should be "Yes" followed by the `k` integers.

### Program Analysis:
- The program first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it immediately returns "No" because it's impossible to have more integers in the sum than the value they need to reach.
- It then computes which bits are set in `n` (indicating powers of `2` that contribute to the sum), collecting their positions in a list called `bits`.
- The program checks if the length of `bits` exceeds `k`. If it does, it returns "No" because we cannot form a sequence of `k` integers from more than `k` bit positions.
- If the size of `bits` is less than `k`, the program enters a loop where it repeatedly takes the smallest bit (the last element) and breaks it down by reducing its value (to create more integers). This ensures that the total number of integers reaches `k`.
- The program then sorts the `bits` list in descending order to ensure it is lexicographically largest.
- Finally, it concatenates the results into a string that matches the expected output format.

### Correctness Examination:
1. **Check if k > n**: The program correctly identifies impossible scenarios.
2. **Count of Set Bits**: The program checks for valid sequences by counting the powers of 2 that compose `n`. If there are too many existing bits, it returns "No".
3. **Constructing Bits for k**: The program dynamically expands `bits` to ensure its length matches `k`. This maintains the minimum maximum value (since it only breaks down existing bits) while ensuring the length requirement is satisfied.
4. **Sorting**: Sorting in reverse provides the lexicographic order required by the problem.

### Edge Cases:
- For example, if `k` is 2 and `n` is 13, the program correctly identifies that it's impossible by counting the bits.
- It also handles cases where no valid sequence can meet the requirements by producing "No".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It adheres to all specified requirements for constructing the integers, checks for impossibility where appropriate, and formats the output correctly.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
