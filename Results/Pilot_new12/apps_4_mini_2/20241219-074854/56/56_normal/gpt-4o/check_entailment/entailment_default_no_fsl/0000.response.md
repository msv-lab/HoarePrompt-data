Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where it's impossible to form a sequence of length `k` from the sum of powers of 2 equaling `n`, even if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. Specifically, it fails in cases where the smallest possible sum of `k` integers each being a power of 2 (including potentially negative powers) cannot achieve the sum `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The smallest sum of two powers of 2 would be `2^1 + 2^0 = 2 + 1 = 3`, which is valid. However, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the smallest sum represents \(2^2 + 2^0 = 4 + 1\), which equals `5`, and thus fails to equal `n = 4`.

Another example would be `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The smallest sum of three integers cannot reach `5` when using whole number powers of 2, given that the sequence would lead to exceeding the sum or not reaching it.

Clearly, these edge cases are not accounted for in the function logic, hence providing an incorrect result when such scenarios arise. Therefore, the output must be "No" in such cases, leading to an inaccurate assessment in the current program implementation.
