The code `bits.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 58) to the list `bits` (which initially contains the value 60). After executing this line, the `bits` list will contain `[60, 58]`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the values [60, 58], and `i` is 58.**
