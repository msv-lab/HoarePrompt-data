The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to \( 10^{18} \), and `k` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to \( 10^{5} \). 

- In Case_1, if `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case_2, it returns 'No' under another unspecified condition.
- In Case_3, if `len(bits)` is equal to `k` (and `k` is less than or equal to `n`), the function returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of the sorted list `bits`, joined by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `k` and determine whether a specific condition is met based on their values, returning different outputs accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a positive integer). It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n`, returns 'No' under another unspecified condition, or returns 'Yes' followed by the elements of the sorted list 'bits' if `len(bits)` equals `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.**
