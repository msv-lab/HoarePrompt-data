According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as the range specified in `range(60, -1, -1)` is valid. In this case, the loop iterates over the values of `i` starting from 60 down to 0 (inclusive). 

The variables `n` and `k` do not affect the loop execution directly, since the loop is solely dependent on the variable `i`. Since the loop will execute for `i` starting at 60 down to 0, the only adjustments needed are to recognize the starting value of `i`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed,  `i` must be initialized to 60 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is an empty list, `i` is 60**
