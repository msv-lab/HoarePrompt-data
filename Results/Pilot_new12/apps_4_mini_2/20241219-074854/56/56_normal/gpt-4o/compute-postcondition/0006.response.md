The statement `bits.append(i)` adds the current value of `i`, which is `60`, to the list `bits`. The list `bits`, which was initially empty, will now contain the value `60`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value `60`, `i` is 60.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value `60`, `i` is 60.**
