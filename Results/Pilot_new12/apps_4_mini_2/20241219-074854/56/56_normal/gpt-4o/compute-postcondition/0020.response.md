The code `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends a new value to the `bits` list. The variable `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, which is also a positive integer because `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`. 

The value being appended is `smallest - 1`, which is still a valid value since `smallest` is positive and thus `smallest - 1` will also be non-negative. After executing the code, the length of `bits` will increase by 1, making it less than or equal to `k` (since it was stated that `len(bits)` is still less than `k` before the operation).

Therefore, the Output State is updated to reflect the change in the `bits` list:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is the original list with `smallest - 1` appended, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, `i` is -1, and `len(bits)` is now less than or equal to `k`.**
