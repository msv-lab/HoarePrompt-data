To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `len(bits) < k`. The loop is designed to continue as long as the length of the `bits` list is less than `k`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`
- `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits set in `n` from 0 to 60
- `i` is -1
- the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`

For the loop to execute one time:
1. We need `len(bits)` to be less than `k`. Since we know `len(bits)` is currently less than or equal to `k`, if it is already equal to `k`, the condition would not be satisfied, and the loop would not execute.
2. Therefore, `len(bits)` should be strictly less than `k`.

Thus, we need `len(bits)` to be adjusted to ensure it is less than `k`. This can be done by making sure `len(bits) < k`, which means currently `len(bits)` must be less than `k` (and not equal to it).

Given these observations, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits set in `n` from 0 to 60, `i` is -1, and `len(bits) must be less than k`**
