The value of `smallest` is assigned the last element of the `bits` list, which is removed in the process (the `pop` method). The previous value of `bits` contained indices of all bits set in `n`, and since `len(bits)` was less than `k`, there continues to be elements in `bits` after this operation. The value of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing elements from the original `bits` list except for the last element, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, `i` is -1, and `len(bits)` is still less than `k`.**
