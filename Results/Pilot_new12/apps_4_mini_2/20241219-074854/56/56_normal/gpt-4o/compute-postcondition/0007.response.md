Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value `60`, and `i` is 60. If the 60th bit of `n` is set (i.e., `n >> 60 & 1` evaluates to true), then `bits` contains the value `60`. Otherwise, `bits` remains unchanged as an empty list.***
