The code initializes an empty list named `bits`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state will reflect that `bits` is now an empty list, while maintaining the initial conditions for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `bits` is an empty list.**
