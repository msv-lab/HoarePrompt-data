The code `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends the value of `smallest - 1` to the end of the `bits` list. The variable `smallest` holds the last element of the original `bits` before the pop operation.

Since `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before this operation, `smallest - 1` is calculated, and that value is added as a new element at the end of `bits`. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` has one more element than before with the last element being `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` before the pop, `i` is -1**.
