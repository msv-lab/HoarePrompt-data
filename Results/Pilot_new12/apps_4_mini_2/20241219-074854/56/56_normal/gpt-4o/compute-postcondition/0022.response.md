According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `bits` list and the value of `k`. The loop will continue as long as the length of `bits` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `len(bits)` is now less than or equal to `k` plus `smallest - 1` has been added to `bits`. 

Since `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, it's important to note that to proceed with the loop condition `len(bits) < k`, the length of `bits` needs to be strictly less than `k`. Given that `len(bits)` is at most `k + (smallest - 1)`, it needs to be adjusted for the current length of `bits` to be strictly less than `k`. Therefore, `len(bits)` should be less than `k`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `len(bits)` is less than `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer and `bits` currently has a size that must be adjusted to meet the loop's requirement, we can reflect this in our state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is the original list with `smallest - 1` appended, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, `i` is -1, and `len(bits)` must be strictly less than `k`**
