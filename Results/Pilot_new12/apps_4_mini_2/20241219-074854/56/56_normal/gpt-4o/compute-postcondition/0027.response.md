After executing the code snippet `smallest = bits.pop()`, the following changes occur:

- `smallest` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `bits`, which was defined as `smallest` before popping it from the list. 
- The `bits` list now has one less element since the last element has been removed.

The previous state indicates that `bits` had one more element than some original state, which means `smallest` was the last element before the pop operation. 

The conditions on `n`, `k`, and `len(bits)` remain unchanged. However, since we have popped an element from `bits`, its length is now strictly less than before. 

Therefore, updating the state accordingly, we have:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` remains a positive integer less than or equal to `n`.
- `bits` now has one less element (noted as `len(bits) - 1`).
- `smallest` now holds the value that was the last element of the `bits` list before the pop operation.
- `i` remains -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` has one less element than before, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` before the pop, and `i` is -1.**
