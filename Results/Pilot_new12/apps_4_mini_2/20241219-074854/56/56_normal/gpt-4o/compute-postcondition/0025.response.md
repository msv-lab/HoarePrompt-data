The code `bits.append(smallest - 1)` adds an element to the `bits` list, specifically the value `smallest - 1`. Since `smallest` is defined as the last element of the original `bits` list, the value being appended is one less than that last element.

`bits` now has one more element than it previously did, and `len(bits)` is still less than or equal to `k`, which confirms that the addition does not exceed the limit set by `k`.

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: 
`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` has one more element than before with the last element being `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, `i` is -1, and `len(bits)` is strictly less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` has one more element than before with the last element being `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, `i` is -1, and `len(bits)` is strictly less than or equal to `k`.**
