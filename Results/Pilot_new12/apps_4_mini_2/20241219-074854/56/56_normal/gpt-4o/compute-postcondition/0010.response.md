Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value `60`, and `i` is 59. If the bitwise operation `n >> i & 1` evaluates to true (meaning the 59th bit of `n` is set to 1), then the condition is satisfied, but no further action is specified in the if part.***
