According to the code, the for loop iterates from 60 down to 0, decreasing the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration. The current state indicates that `i` is 59. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to 58. 

There are no other variable states that significantly need modification for the next iteration since the for loop will continue to operate based solely on the decrementing value of `i`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value `60`, and `i` is 58**
