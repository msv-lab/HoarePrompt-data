The variable `smallest` is assigned the value of the last element of the `bits` list, which is then removed from `bits` using the `pop()` method. Because `smallest` was previously equal to the last element of `bits`, after the execution `bits` will contain one less element. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition of `len(bits)` must still be strictly less than `k` after the operation because `bits` has now had one element removed. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `bits` has one less element than before, `smallest` is the last element of the original `bits` list, `i` is -1, and `len(bits)` is strictly less than `k`.**
