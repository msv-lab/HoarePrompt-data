Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases specified in the problem description. Specifically, while the program checks if `n < k` and prints "No" in that case, it fails in scenarios where `n` is large but not sufficiently decomposable into `k` powers of 2 that meet the requirement for lexicographical order.

For example, when `n = 8` and `k = 3`, the program will output "No" despite it being possible to represent `8` with three components by using negative powers, such as `1`, `1`, and `-1` (which sum up to `1 + 1 + 1/2 = 8`). The allowed sequence length could enable the representation of `n` as powers of `2` where some are negative.

Additionally, the output hints suggest the program fails to adequately explore this possibility. Thus, there exists at least one scenario — such as the one drawn above — where the output from the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Consequently, this leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
