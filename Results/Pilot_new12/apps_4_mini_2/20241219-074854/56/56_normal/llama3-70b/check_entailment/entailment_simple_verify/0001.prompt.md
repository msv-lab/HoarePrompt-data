You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and check if it adheres to the requirements outlined in the description. 

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (the required sum) and `k` (the length of the sequence).

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n < k`. If so, it prints "No" because you cannot obtain a sum of `n` using `k` distinct non-negative integers if the sum is less than `k`.

3. **Finding Powers of Two**:
   - The program attempts to find the largest powers of two that can be subtracted from `n`.
   - It does this by using the `bit_length()` method to determine the highest power of 2 that fits into `n`. 
   - It keeps track of how many powers of 2 have been selected via the variable `i`.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - If the length of the list `a` (which contains the selected powers of 2) is less than `k`, it prints "No".
   - If it has enough elements, it truncates the list to the length `k`, sorts it in descending order, and outputs "Yes" followed by the sorted powers.

### Potential Issues

1. **Insufficient Elements**: The program does not handle the case where it cannot reach the required sum of `n` while ensuring that the length of the sequence is exactly `k`. It might end up selecting too few elements and just truncating the list to `k`, which fails to provide a correct solution.

2. **Negative Powers**: The program does not handle the possibility of negative powers. The problem allows the use of negative powers of 2 (which could be necessary to reach the exact sum with `k` numbers). Hence, a case like \( n = 1, k = 2 \) should output "Yes" and perhaps \(-1, -1\) to signify that the mention of negative powers is critical.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the input:
```
2 2
```
Expected output:
```
Yes
1 1
```
Explanation: \( 2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 = 4 \), this output violates lexicographical conditions, and also cannot produce the exact sum using two distinct integers of the form \( k \).

However, the current program logic might produce incorrect results for similar constructs. In this case, it incorrectly assumes it can always partition sums directly into the powers it determines via bit manipulation.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues and lack of handling for edge cases involving negative powers, we can confidently state that the program does not adhere to the problem specifications in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer up to 10^18, k is a positive integer up to 100,000.

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `i` is the number of iterations executed until `n` could no longer provide a positive value to continue, and `a` contains the list of `x` values corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 0, and `i` is the number of iterations executed until `n` could no longer provide a positive value to continue. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then `a` contains `x` values corresponding to each iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `a` contains the first `k` elements sorted in descending order, and these elements are printed as a space-separated string.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer up to 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer up to 100,000. If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, if `n` is 0, `i` represents the number of iterations executed until `n` could no longer provide a positive value to continue. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then `a` contains `i` values corresponding to each iteration of the loop. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` contains the first `k` elements sorted in descending order, which are printed as a space-separated string.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
