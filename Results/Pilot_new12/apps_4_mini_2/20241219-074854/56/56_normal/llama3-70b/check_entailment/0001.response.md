To determine the correctness of the given Python program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and check if it adheres to the requirements outlined in the description. 

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (the required sum) and `k` (the length of the sequence).

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n < k`. If so, it prints "No" because you cannot obtain a sum of `n` using `k` distinct non-negative integers if the sum is less than `k`.

3. **Finding Powers of Two**:
   - The program attempts to find the largest powers of two that can be subtracted from `n`.
   - It does this by using the `bit_length()` method to determine the highest power of 2 that fits into `n`. 
   - It keeps track of how many powers of 2 have been selected via the variable `i`.

4. **Final Validation**:
   - If the length of the list `a` (which contains the selected powers of 2) is less than `k`, it prints "No".
   - If it has enough elements, it truncates the list to the length `k`, sorts it in descending order, and outputs "Yes" followed by the sorted powers.

### Potential Issues

1. **Insufficient Elements**: The program does not handle the case where it cannot reach the required sum of `n` while ensuring that the length of the sequence is exactly `k`. It might end up selecting too few elements and just truncating the list to `k`, which fails to provide a correct solution.

2. **Negative Powers**: The program does not handle the possibility of negative powers. The problem allows the use of negative powers of 2 (which could be necessary to reach the exact sum with `k` numbers). Hence, a case like \( n = 1, k = 2 \) should output "Yes" and perhaps \(-1, -1\) to signify that the mention of negative powers is critical.

### Counterexample

Let's consider the input:
```
2 2
```
Expected output:
```
Yes
1 1
```
Explanation: \( 2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 = 4 \), this output violates lexicographical conditions, and also cannot produce the exact sum using two distinct integers of the form \( k \).

However, the current program logic might produce incorrect results for similar constructs. In this case, it incorrectly assumes it can always partition sums directly into the powers it determines via bit manipulation.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues and lack of handling for edge cases involving negative powers, we can confidently state that the program does not adhere to the problem specifications in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
