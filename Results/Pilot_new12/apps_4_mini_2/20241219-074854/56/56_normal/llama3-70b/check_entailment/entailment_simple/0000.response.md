To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step and verify if it meets the stated requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The program must find `k` integers such that the sum of `2^a_i` equals `n`, where `a_i`s are integers.
2. The output must ensure that the maximum integer in the output list is as small as possible (`y`).
3. Among the sequences with the minimum `y`, the output must be lexicographically largest.
4. If a sequence is not possible, the program must print "No".
5. If a sequence is possible, the program must print "Yes" and the sequence.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   The program reads two integers `n` and `k` correctly.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   The first condition checks if `n < k`. If true, then it is impossible to find `k` integers that can sum up to `n` since the smallest possible `k` integers would be `k` zeros. Thus, it correctly outputs "No".
   
3. **Building the Sequence:**
   - The program uses bit manipulation to find the largest power of 2 that fits into `n`. It repeatedly subtracts the largest power of 2 from `n` in a loop.
   - It appends the powers found to the list `a`.
   - The loop continues until it can no longer subtract a positive power of 2.

4. **Final Conditions Check:**
   After the loop, the program checks if the length of `a` is less than `k`. If it is less, it outputs "No" because it cannot find `k` integers. 
   - If `len(a)` is greater than or equal to `k`, it takes the first `k` elements and sorts them in descending order.

5. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The chosen approach of sorting `a` in descending order ensures the output is lexicographically largest when outputting the integers.

### Conclusion of the Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies if the sequence exists and outputs "No" if the sequence cannot be formed based on the initial checks.
- The mechanism to construct the `a` list from powers of 2 ensures that the values are the largest possible that add up to the required `n`.
- It sorts the results correctly to ensure the lexicographical condition.
- It preserves the maximum integer as small as possible since the largest used power is minimized throughout the construction of `a`.

Given all of the above analysis, the program accurately follows the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
