You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it meets all criteria specified in the problem description.

1. **Input Interpretation:**
   - The input consists of two integers, `n` and `k`. The goal is to find `k` integers such that the sum of two to the power of each integer equals `n`.

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - If such a sequence exists, print "Yes" followed by the sequence of integers.
   - If it does not exist, print "No".

3. **Constraints and Conditions:**
   - The sum of the integers raised to the power of 2 needs to equal `n`.
   - The maximum integer in the sequence must be minimized.
   - Among the minimum `y` value sequences, output the lexicographically largest one.

### Review of the given program:

- The program checks if `n < k` initially and returns "No" because this means there's no way to express `n` with `k` integers.
- It extracts the powers of two from `n` by determining the position of the highest bit set (using `bit_length() - 1`).
- It constructs the list `a` by successively adding the highest powers of two until `n` is reduced to 0 or there are no more unique powers to add.
- If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it outputs "No".
- If there are enough powers, it takes the first `k` largest powers, sorts them in reverse (to ensure lexicographical order), and outputs the result.

### Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Input where `k` is greater than the number of distinct powers needed:**
   - For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 3`, in theory you would need to find a way to express 1 as a sum of three terms using powers of 2. The result should lead to `-1` in certain cases. However, while 1 can be represented as \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1\), the program does not currently return `-1 -1` as required by the example which may lead to incorrect results for such inputs.

2. **Input where it’s impossible to create a sequence but current implementation returns "Yes":**
   - If a case exists where the number of powers of `2` is equal to or less than `k` but cannot satisfy the condition (like when higher integer values in `a` are required), the return should be handled.

### Conclusion:

The program lacks sufficient handling for certain cases described in the problem. Specifically, it omits providing valid outputs in scenarios where additional integers are expected to fill the sequence or where numbers fall below certain thresholds that are specified (like `-1` for exceeding bounds).

Based on the potential case identified where the output does not meet the requirement of `-1` for sequences that need padding but aren't valid, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers, `n` (a positive integer up to \(10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer up to 100,000). It first checks if `n` is less than `k`, printing 'No' if true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function enters a loop that attempts to decompose `n` into powers of two, storing the indices of these powers in a list `a`. The loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0 or no further powers can be used. After the loop, if the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. If the length of `a` is at least `k`, it truncates `a` to the first `k` values, sorts them in descending order, and prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted elements as a space-separated string. The state of the program after execution ensures that either a rejection with 'No' is communicated, or, if accepted, the first `k` components of `n` are successfully returned in a sorted format.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
