To analyze the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it meets all criteria specified in the problem description.

1. **Input Interpretation:**
   - The input consists of two integers, `n` and `k`. The goal is to find `k` integers such that the sum of two to the power of each integer equals `n`.

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - If such a sequence exists, print "Yes" followed by the sequence of integers.
   - If it does not exist, print "No".

3. **Constraints and Conditions:**
   - The sum of the integers raised to the power of 2 needs to equal `n`.
   - The maximum integer in the sequence must be minimized.
   - Among the minimum `y` value sequences, output the lexicographically largest one.

### Review of the given program:

- The program checks if `n < k` initially and returns "No" because this means there's no way to express `n` with `k` integers.
- It extracts the powers of two from `n` by determining the position of the highest bit set (using `bit_length() - 1`).
- It constructs the list `a` by successively adding the highest powers of two until `n` is reduced to 0 or there are no more unique powers to add.
- If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it outputs "No".
- If there are enough powers, it takes the first `k` largest powers, sorts them in reverse (to ensure lexicographical order), and outputs the result.

### Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Input where `k` is greater than the number of distinct powers needed:**
   - For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 3`, in theory you would need to find a way to express 1 as a sum of three terms using powers of 2. The result should lead to `-1` in certain cases. However, while 1 can be represented as \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1\), the program does not currently return `-1 -1` as required by the example which may lead to incorrect results for such inputs.

2. **Input where itâ€™s impossible to create a sequence but current implementation returns "Yes":**
   - If a case exists where the number of powers of `2` is equal to or less than `k` but cannot satisfy the condition (like when higher integer values in `a` are required), the return should be handled.

### Conclusion:

The program lacks sufficient handling for certain cases described in the problem. Specifically, it omits providing valid outputs in scenarios where additional integers are expected to fill the sequence or where numbers fall below certain thresholds that are specified (like `-1` for exceeding bounds).

Based on the potential case identified where the output does not meet the requirement of `-1` for sequences that need padding but aren't valid, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
