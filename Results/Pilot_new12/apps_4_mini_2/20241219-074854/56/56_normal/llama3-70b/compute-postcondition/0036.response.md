Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, and `i` is the number of iterations executed until `n` could no longer provide a positive value to continue. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then `a` contains `x` values corresponding to each iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `a` contains the first `k` elements sorted in descending order, and these elements are printed as a space-separated string.***
