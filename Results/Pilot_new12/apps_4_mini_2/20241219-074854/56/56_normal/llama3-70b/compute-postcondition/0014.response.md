According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer reduced by `2`, so we can denote it as `n' = n_initial - 2`, where `n_initial` is the initial value of `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to ensure it remains greater than 0 after being reduced by 2. Thus, `n_initial` would need to have been at least 3 (because 3 - 2 = 1, which is still greater than 0).

Currently, we know that `n` is `positive - 2`, meaning `n` must be at least `3` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is increased by 1**
