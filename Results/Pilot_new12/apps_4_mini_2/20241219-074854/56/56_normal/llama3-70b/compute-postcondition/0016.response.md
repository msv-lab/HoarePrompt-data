The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, where `n` is at least 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
