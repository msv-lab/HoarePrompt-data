The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console, but it does not modify any variable states. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the output consists solely of the printed string. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer up to 10^18, `k` is an input positive integer up to 100,000, `n` is less than `k`, and 'No' has been printed.**
