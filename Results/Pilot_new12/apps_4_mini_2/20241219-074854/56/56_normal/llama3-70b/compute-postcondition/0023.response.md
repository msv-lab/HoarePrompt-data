The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, `a` includes `x`, and `n` must be at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
