The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is at least 1, but since nothing changes for `n`, `x`, and `a`, we only update `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, and `a` includes `x`.**
