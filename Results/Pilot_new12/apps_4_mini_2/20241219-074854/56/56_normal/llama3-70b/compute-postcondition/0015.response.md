`x` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which will be at least 2 since `n` is at least 3. Therefore, `n.bit_length()` is at least 2 and `x` will be at least 1. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3; `i` is increased by 1; `x` is at least 1 (specifically, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`, where `n` is at least 3).**
