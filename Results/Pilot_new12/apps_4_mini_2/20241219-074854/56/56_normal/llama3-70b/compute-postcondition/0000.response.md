The values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided through `input().split()`, which is then converted to integers. The initial state of `n` is a positive integer up to \(10^{18}\), and `k` is a positive integer up to \(100,000\). Since specific values for `n` and `k` are not provided, we represent them as input integers after the execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer up to 10^18, `k` is an input positive integer up to 100,000**
