The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided code snippet. However, it operates under given constraints where `n` is a positive integer up to \(10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer up to 100,000. The output is not specified in the output section provided, but since `n` and `k` come with constraints, we can infer that the function may perform some computations or return values based on these inputs.

Since the output is not provided in detail, we will describe the functionality based on the assumption that the function utilizes these constraints `n` and `k` to perform its task.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer up to 10^18 and k is a positive integer up to 100,000, returning a result based on these constraints.**
