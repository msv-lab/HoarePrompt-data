Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer up to 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer up to 100,000. If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, if `n` is 0, `i` represents the number of iterations executed until `n` could no longer provide a positive value to continue. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, then `a` contains `i` values corresponding to each iteration of the loop. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` contains the first `k` elements sorted in descending order, which are printed as a space-separated string.***
