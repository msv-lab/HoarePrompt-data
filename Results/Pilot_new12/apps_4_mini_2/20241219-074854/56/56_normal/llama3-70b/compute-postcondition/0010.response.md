Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer up to 100,000, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the control flow continues beyond the if statement without executing any code in the else part.***
