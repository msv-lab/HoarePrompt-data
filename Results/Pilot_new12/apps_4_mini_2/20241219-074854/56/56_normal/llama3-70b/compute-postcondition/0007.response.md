The bit_length() method returns the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Therefore, when we subtract 1 from this value, we get the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `x` will be `n.bit_length() - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer up to 100,000, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
