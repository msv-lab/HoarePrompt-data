The function reads two integers, `n` (a positive integer up to \(10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer up to 100,000). It first checks if `n` is less than `k`, printing 'No' if true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function enters a loop that attempts to decompose `n` into powers of two, storing the indices of these powers in a list `a`. The loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0 or no further powers can be used. After the loop, if the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. If the length of `a` is at least `k`, it truncates `a` to the first `k` values, sorts them in descending order, and prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted elements as a space-separated string. The state of the program after execution ensures that either a rejection with 'No' is communicated, or, if accepted, the first `k` components of `n` are successfully returned in a sorted format.
