Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`. If `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[1 + a]`, which retains its previous value.***
