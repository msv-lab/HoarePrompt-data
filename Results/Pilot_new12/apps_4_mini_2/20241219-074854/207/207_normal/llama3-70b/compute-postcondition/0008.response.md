To analyze the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial Variables:** 
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is the value of the second input integer.
   - `b` is the value of the third input integer.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are 0.

2. **Condition:** 
   The snippet checks if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`. If this condition holds true, then `dp[a]` is updated to 1. 

3. **Second Condition:** 
   The current value of `i` minus `b` is checked to ensure it is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Code Execution:** 
   The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` performs an update to the `dp` list. Since `i` is initially 0, this means that the update will effectively be `dp[0] += dp[0 - b]`. However, since `i - b` could be negative depending on the value of `b`, we need to validate this scenario.

5. **Impact on `dp`:** 
   If `i - b` is a valid index (greater than or equal to 0), it means `dp[0]` could be incremented by `dp[-b]`. In Python, indexing a list with a negative number it is invalid unless explicitly managed, but in the context provided, we are interested in the case where it does validate.

**Conclusion of Output State:**
Assuming that the conditions enable the execution without any out-of-bounds errors, the state of `dp` will be altered accordingly.

The values for `m`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and the initial conditions of array `dp` remain intact unless evidence of alterations occurs due to the conditions. 

Since `i` was initially 0, this might impact `dp[0]` based on the logic provided.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer; if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is updated to 1; `dp[0]` might increase by `dp[-b]` if valid.**
