In this case, the loop is set to iterate from `0` to `m`, inclusive, which means it will execute `m + 1` times. Let's examine the states:

- `m` is given as the value of the first input integer.
- We need to ensure the loop will actually run, which means that `m` must be at least `0` because if `m` is `-1`, the range would be from `0` to `-1`, resulting in no iterations.
- The variable `i` will take values from `0` up to `m`, inclusive, starting from `0`.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, we have to ensure that `m` is non-negative. At the start of the first execution of the loop, `i` will be initialized to `0`. 

Let's summarize the adjusted states:

State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are 0**
