The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to zero. This does not change the values of `m`, `a`, or `b`, but it does create a new variable `dp`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the creation of the `dp` array while maintaining the previous condition for `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`m` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.**
