According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `m`. The loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes it 2. Since there is no restriction on the value of `m` aside from being non-negative, there are no additional changes needed for `m`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are: `i` becomes 2 and `dp` does not require any adjustments based on the provided conditions, whereas the existing values of `a`, `b`, and `dp` remain unchanged. 

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`.**
