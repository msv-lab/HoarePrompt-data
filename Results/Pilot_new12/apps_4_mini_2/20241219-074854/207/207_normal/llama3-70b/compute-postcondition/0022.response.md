The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as it is defined without any input in its parentheses. Instead, it relies on internal logic to determine its output. Given the context provided, it is understood that the function will return a value based on the constraints of three variables: `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

Since specific conditions and output scenarios were not provided in your request, I will assume there are no special cases detailed here. As a result, I will focus on providing a general description of the assumed functionality based on the constraints given:

Functionality: **The function computes a result based on internal logic using positive integers m, a, and b with constraints 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= a <= 10^5, and 1 <= b <= 10^5, and returns that result.**
