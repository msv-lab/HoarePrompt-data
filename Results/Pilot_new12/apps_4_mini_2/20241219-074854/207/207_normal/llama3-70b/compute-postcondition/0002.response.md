The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[0]`. The variable `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, initialized with zeros. Thus, now `dp[0]` will be `1`, while the rest of the elements in the list remain `0`. Therefore, the value of `dp` will be updated but the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` will stay the same.

Output State: **`m` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are 0.**
