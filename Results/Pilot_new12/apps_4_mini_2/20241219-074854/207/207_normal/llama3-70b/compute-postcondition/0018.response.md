The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - b]` to it. The variable `i` is 2, and `b` is defined as the value of the third input integer. The value of `m` is greater than or equal to 0, which means we have sufficient indices in the `dp` list for the operation. 

- `dp[i]` becomes `dp[2] + dp[2 - b]`. 

The other variables (`m`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and the conditions on them) remain unchanged, as this line of code only affects the `dp` list.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, and `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`.**
