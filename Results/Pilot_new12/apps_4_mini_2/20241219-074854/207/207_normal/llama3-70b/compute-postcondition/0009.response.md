Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are 0. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, the state of `dp` will be altered accordingly. If the conditions for updating `dp` are satisfied without any out-of-bounds errors, the values for `m`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain intact unless evidence of alterations occurs due to the conditions.***
