The operation modifies the list `dp`. Specifically, `dp[i + a]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. Since the value of `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are initially 0, when the operation is executed, we are effectively updating `dp` at the index `i + a` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. 

The precondition states that `i` is 0, and `a` is the value of the second input integer, meaning `i + a` could be equal to `a` itself. Therefore, we can infer that `dp[a]` will be updated to 1 (the current value of `dp[0]`).

Now, other variables maintain their initial states since they are not altered by this statement.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` are 0, `dp[a]` is updated to 1.**
