The code snippet `print(sum(dp))` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `dp`, which has been defined as holding the count of ways to reach each index based on the provided input integers `a` and `b` with respect to the initial integer `m`. Since `dp[0]` is 1, and the values of `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` contain counts based on input integers, the output will reflect the total count of ways to reach those indices.

Given that the initial state indicates `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, and `dp[0]` is 1, we can sum the elements from `dp[0]` to `dp[m]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, `dp[0]` is 1, the sum of `dp` is the total count of ways to reach indices `0` to `m`.**
