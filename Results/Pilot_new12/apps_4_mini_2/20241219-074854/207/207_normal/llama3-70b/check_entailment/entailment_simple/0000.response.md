Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

### Reasons:

1. **Functionality of `dp`:** 
   - The `dp` array is intended to keep track of the distinct integers that the frog can reach for each position from 0 to `m`. However, the logic used in the program to update `dp[i + a]` and `dp[i]` does not correspond to the requirements of the problem. 

2. **Incorrect Jump Logic:**
   - The logic for counting reachable positions is flawed. The code does not account correctly for the distinct integers reached by the jumps of size `a` (forward) and `b` (backward). Specifically, the line `if i - b >= 0: dp[i] += dp[i - b]` does not accurately capture possible distinct reachable positions; it mistakenly modifies the same index based on a subtraction operation.

3. **Lack of Clarity in Count:**
   - The program fails to calculate `f(i)` correctly, as `dp[i]` is supposed to represent the count of distinct positions that can be reached starting from zero. Instead, it diverges by treating indices based on jump counts rather than the unique integers reachable.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The program sums up the values stored in `dp`, assuming these represent the number of reachable integers. However, since `dp[i]` does not reflect distinct reachable indices accurately, the final sum will be incorrect.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach that may not handle all edge cases effectively based on varying inputs for `a` and `b`, especially when `a` is significantly larger than `b` or vice versa.

In summary, the logic used in the `func` does not correctly adhere to the constraints of the problem and consequently fails to yield the expected output, violating the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is marked as **False**.
