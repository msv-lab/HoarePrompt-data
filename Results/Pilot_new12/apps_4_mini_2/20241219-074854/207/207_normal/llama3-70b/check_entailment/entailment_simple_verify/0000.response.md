The original assessment points out the potential issues with the program's logic, specifically regarding how it calculates the distinct positions reachable by the frog after accounting for jumps both forward and backward. The accusation in the assessment indicates that backward jumps may inaccurately influence the count of reachable positions, leading to incorrect values in the `dp` array.

The provided annotated code gives essential insights:
- The program initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of ways the frog can reach each position.
- After completing the for loop, it seems to build the cumulative counts based on its logic. However, the original assessment raises concerns about the way backward jumps are handled, speculated to potentially count the same positions incorrectly.

The annotations confirm that `dp[i]` accumulates the number of ways to reach `i`, which implicitly suggests counting overlaps of positions due to backward jumps. The specification regarding calculating distinct integers isn't explicitly handled, and the presence of backward jumps could indeed cause an inflated count for certain values of `i`. 

Considering the example provided and the logic that the assessment emphasizes, the program indeed runs the risk of miscounting distinct integers due to the manner in which it handles backward jumps. This leads to the conclusion that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description accurately.

Final: **False**
