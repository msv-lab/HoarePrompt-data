To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function.

### Problem Description Recap:
A frog starts at position 0 and can jump to position \(k + a\) or \(k - b\). We need to calculate \(f(x)\), the number of distinct integers the frog can reach in the range [0, x], and then find the sum of \(f(i)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(m\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided function reads the inputs \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\), initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` to keep track of how many ways the frog can reach each position. 

- `dp[0]` is initialized to 1, indicating that the frog starts at position 0.
- The logic loops over each position \(i\) from 0 to \(m\):
  - It attempts to jump to \(i + a\) if it's within bounds.
  - It tries to jump back to \(i - b\), which might be incorrectly handled here.

However, an error in understanding arises in that jumping back to \(i - b\) can lead to a situation where it inaccurately counts the number of reachable integers, as it is not correctly considering the distinct positions reachable after each operation.

### Example Case:
Consider when \(m=1\), \(a=1\), and \(b=1\):
- \(f(0) = 1\) (only 0)
- \(f(1) = ?\) The frog can jump to 1 but also might jump back to 0 which shouldn't affect counting distinct totals because we need to correctly account for jumps.

With the current dynamic programming implementation, it might produce incorrect totals since `dp[i]` is augmented incorrectly when assessing backward jumps.

Thus it seems that there are potential flaws due to incorrect indexing or logic in `dp`, especially in how jumping back affects the distinct count, meaning \(f(x)\) could be calculated incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate \(f(x)\) for all cases due to the potential miscounts in the `dp` array. The case where both jumps have the same distance could cause it to count positions wrongly.

Correctness: **False**.
