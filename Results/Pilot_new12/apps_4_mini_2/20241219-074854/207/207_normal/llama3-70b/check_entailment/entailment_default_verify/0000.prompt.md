You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function.

### Problem Description Recap:
A frog starts at position 0 and can jump to position \(k + a\) or \(k - b\). We need to calculate \(f(x)\), the number of distinct integers the frog can reach in the range [0, x], and then find the sum of \(f(i)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(m\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided function reads the inputs \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\), initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` to keep track of how many ways the frog can reach each position. 

- `dp[0]` is initialized to 1, indicating that the frog starts at position 0.
- The logic loops over each position \(i\) from 0 to \(m\):
  - It attempts to jump to \(i + a\) if it's within bounds.
  - It tries to jump back to \(i - b\), which might be incorrectly handled here.

However, an error in understanding arises in that jumping back to \(i - b\) can lead to a situation where it inaccurately counts the number of reachable integers, as it is not correctly considering the distinct positions reachable after each operation.

### Example Case:
Consider when \(m=1\), \(a=1\), and \(b=1\):
- \(f(0) = 1\) (only 0)
- \(f(1) = ?\) The frog can jump to 1 but also might jump back to 0 which shouldn't affect counting distinct totals because we need to correctly account for jumps.

With the current dynamic programming implementation, it might produce incorrect totals since `dp[i]` is augmented incorrectly when assessing backward jumps.

Thus it seems that there are potential flaws due to incorrect indexing or logic in `dp`, especially in how jumping back affects the distinct count, meaning \(f(x)\) could be calculated incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate \(f(x)\) for all cases due to the potential miscounts in the `dp` array. The case where both jumps have the same distance could cause it to count positions wrongly.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three positive integers, m, a, and b. It calculates the number of ways to reach each index from 0 to m using steps of size a (moving forward) and b (moving backward) and stores the result in a list dp. After processing the entire range from 0 to m, it sums up all the values in the dp list and prints the total. This sum represents the total number of distinct ways to arrive at each index from the starting point (0) under the given constraints. It's important to note that due to the constraints provided, particularly the large possible value of m (up to 10^9), the implementation may face performance issues with memory and time complexity, as constructing a dp list of this size could be impractical. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the computed result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
