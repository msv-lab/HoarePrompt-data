The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on the number line, using dynamic programming and storing the results in a list `dp`. However, it has some significant issues related to the constraints of the problem.

### Issues:
1. **Memory Constraint**: The array `dp` is initialized with a size of `m + 1`, which can be up to `10^9 + 1`. This size is impractical for memory usage, and Python will not be able to allocate such a large array on most systems. This will lead to a MemoryError before even processing any jumps.

2. **Incorrect Logic on Backward Jumps**: The line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` does not make sense as it tries to add the number of ways to arrive at `i` from `i - b`, which is incorrect. It should actually be accumulating ways for indices up to `m`, which it doesn't.

3. **Outer Loop Logic**: The way the program is structured does not ensure that each possible position is visited correctly based on the forward and backward jumps. The current design could lead to incorrect accumulation of values in `dp`.

4. **Potential Overcounting**: The logic does not properly account for distinct positions that can be reached based on the jumps, as elements may overlap in reaching the same position through different paths.

From the output hints, there is a focus on how the function calculates the total number of distinct ways to reach indices, but because of the enormous potential for `m`, this approach is not only inefficient but will not work for all valid inputs within the constraints. 

### Conclusion:
Due to these flaws in handling the problem, particularly memory issues and logical errors, the function does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
