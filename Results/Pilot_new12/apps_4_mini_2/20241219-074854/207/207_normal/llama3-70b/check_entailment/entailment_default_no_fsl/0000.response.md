Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

1. The function calculates the number of ways to reach each index from `0` to `m` using jumps of size `a` forward and `b` backward, but it incorrectly interprets the problem. The problem asks for the total number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the bounds `[0, x]` for each `x` from `0` to `m`.

2. The output hints and the code suggest that `dp[i]` is supposed to represent the number of ways to reach the `i`-th position. However, the problem statement requires `f(x)` to represent the number of distinct integers reachable from `0` to `x`, not the number of ways to reach each index.

3. For example, if we take `(m, a, b) = (7, 5, 3)`, the code would not yield the correct `f(i)` values, as it adds up the counts of ways rather than unique reachable positions. 

4. Furthermore, the dynamic programming approach that tries to store values for all `m + 1` indices would eventually lead to performance issues given the constraints that `m` can go up to `10^9`, rendering the code impractical for large inputs.

5. Specifically, the function does not correctly calculate when backward jumps bring the frog back into the range and fails to take proper account of all reachable positions. It also does not effectively consider the constraints of the problem, which can lead to significant portions of the number line being overlooked.

Thus, since the code fails to meet the problem's requirements in all conditions described, the final output should denote that the correctness is false.
