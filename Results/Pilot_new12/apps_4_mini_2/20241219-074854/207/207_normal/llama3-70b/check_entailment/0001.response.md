To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and consider potential edge cases.

### Program Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The frog starts at position 0 and can jump to \( k + a \) or \( k - b \).
   - We need to calculate \( f(i) \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( m \), where \( f(i) \) counts the distinct integers the frog can reach in the range \([0, i]\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - A list `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` will accumulate the count of ways to reach position `i`.
   - The program fills this list based on two possible moves: jumping forward (`k + a`) or jumping backward (`k - b`).

3. **Key Flaws in the Code**:
   - The program initializes the count of reachable positions at `dp[0]` to 1, indicating that starting at position 0 is always reachable.
   - The jumps are supposed to modify the reachable counts for other positions, but the logic in the loop seems flawed:
     - When jumping backward, the code attempts to add to `dp[i]` based on a potentially incorrect index (`dp[i - b]`), but the frog cannot jump backward if it is at position 0.
     - Therefore, `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` should not factor in cases where `i < b`, which can potentially cause the program to count positions incorrectly.

4. **Potential Edge Case**:
   - Consider the input `(m = 1, a = 1, b = 2)`. The frog can only jump to position 1 (from 0) and cannot jump back (0 - 2 is out of bounds). Thus, `f(0) = 1` and `f(1) = 2` (0 and 1 are reachable). The expected sum \( f(0) + f(1) = 3 \). The actual logic might lead to an incorrect count due to error in indices.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program will not correctly compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach due to the improper handling of jumps and boundary conditions. 

**Correctness: False**
