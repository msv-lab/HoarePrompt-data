The provided program attempts to solve the problem of counting the number of distinct integers a frog can reach by jumping forward by `a` and backward by `b`, and then calculating the sum of these counts for all integers from `0` to `m`.

However, the program contains a logical flaw in its implementation.

1. The `dp` array is intended to store the number of ways to reach each index, but the update logic is incorrect. Specifically, when the program attempts to update `dp[i - b]`, it mistakenly doubles the count for `dp[i]`. The second update modifies `dp[i]`, which means it doesn't accurately represent the count of distinct reachable integers, as the back jump can lead to inaccurate counts if multiple paths are considered.

2. The task is to compute `f(i)` which is not simply counting the ways to arrive at each index, but rather finding the distinct integers that can be reached based on the constraints of jumping forward and backward while staying within bounds. As written, the logic doesnâ€™t differentiate between reachable states correctly.

3. Moreover, the program does not implement any logic to determine how many distinct integers are reachable from the starting point, which is a critical requirement of the problem description.

As a result, the conclusions drawn from the `dp` list and the final sum do not align with the expected outputs defined in the problem description. 

Due to these discrepancies, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is determined to be:

Correctness: **False**
