#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer, and y is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, where y is 0. Thus, the return value is x, which is the value of x itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function runs a loop that continues as long as `y` is not zero, repeatedly updating `x` with the value of `y` and `y` with the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The final state upon completion is that the function returns the GCD, which is the value in `x` when `y` reaches zero. It is important to note that if either input is zero, the function defaults to returning the other non-zero value, reflecting the mathematical principle that the GCD of zero and a non-zero integer is the non-zero integer itself.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 applied to the values m // g, a // g, and b // g, multiplied by g, using the initial values of m, a, b, and g, where g is the result of func_1(a, b) not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, and `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b).
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first m positive integers, which is calculated as (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m < a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b), `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns sum_k which is equal to (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 plus sum_m which is equal to m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, a positive integer (1 <= m <= 10^9), and `a`, `b`, both positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^5). It performs the following actions: 

1. It calculates `g` as the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
2. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with adjusted values of `m`, `a`, and `b` (dividing each by `g`) and returns the result multiplied by `g`.
3. If `g` equals 1, it calculates `k` as `a + b - 1` and checks if `m` is less than `k`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers.
4. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it computes `sum_k`, the sum of the first `k` integers, and `sum_m`, the sum of integers from `k + 1` to `m`, then returns their combined total.

In cases where `m` is less than `k`, the function returns a specific sum of integers, while if `g` equals 1, it calculates combined sums based on `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns values other than 1 (beyond further recursive calls) and assumes valid positive integer inputs. The final state of the program, depending on the input values, results in the output being a calculated integer based on the specified logic.
