The variable `k` is assigned the value of `a + b - 1`. The values of `a` and `b` are within the ranges specified (1 to 100,000), so `k` will also end up being a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b), and `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.**
