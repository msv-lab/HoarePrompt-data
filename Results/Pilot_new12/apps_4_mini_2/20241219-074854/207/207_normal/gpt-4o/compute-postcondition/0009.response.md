To calculate `sum_m`, we need to first evaluate the variables involved.

1. We know that `m` is a positive integer in the range `[1, 10^9]`.
2. `a` and `b` are positive integers in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
3. `g` is equal to `1`.
4. `k` is equal to `a + b - 1` and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
5. `sum_k` is calculated using the formula `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.

Now, let's compute `sum_m` using the formula provided:

```
sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
```

This indicates that `sum_m` is determined as follows:

- The first part `m * (m + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `m` integers.
- The second part `k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `(k - 1)` integers.

Finally, `sum_m` is essentially the total sum of integers from `1` to `m` minus the sum of integers from `1` to `k - 1`.

The existing conditions related to `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `g` remain valid, and no other original variable values are impacted directly.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, and `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`.**
