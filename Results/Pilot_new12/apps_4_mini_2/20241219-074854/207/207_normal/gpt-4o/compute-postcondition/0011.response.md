The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 10^9 \). The parameters `a` and `b` are positive integers with the constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5 \). 

Based on the output, the function performs the following:

- Case 1: If the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` is not equal to 1 (where \( g \) is that result), the function returns the result of `func_2` applied to values \( m // g \), \( a // g \), and \( b // g \), multiplied by \( g \).

- Case 2: If \( m \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m < a + b - 1 \), the function returns the sum of the first \( m \) positive integers, calculated as \( (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2 \).

- Case 3: The function returns `sum_k`, which is equal to \( (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 \) plus `sum_m`, which is equal to \( m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2 \).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b`, and based on these inputs, returns different results depending on the conditions specified in the cases outlined. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, where m is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 10^9) and a, b are positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^5), and returns different values based on specific cases involving calculations with m, a, b, and g.**
