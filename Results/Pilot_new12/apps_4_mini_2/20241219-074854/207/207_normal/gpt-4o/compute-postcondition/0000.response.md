The variable `g` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(a, b)`. The actual output depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided, but the output of `g` will be determined by the inputs `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State retains the information about `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, and `g` is the result of func_1(a, b).**
