The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function runs a loop that continues as long as `y` is not zero, repeatedly updating `x` with the value of `y` and `y` with the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The final state upon completion is that the function returns the GCD, which is the value in `x` when `y` reaches zero. It is important to note that if either input is zero, the function defaults to returning the other non-zero value, reflecting the mathematical principle that the GCD of zero and a non-zero integer is the non-zero integer itself.
