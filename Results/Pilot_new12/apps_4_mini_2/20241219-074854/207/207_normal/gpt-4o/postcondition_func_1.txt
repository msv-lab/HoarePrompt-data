The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, a positive integer (1 <= m <= 10^9), and `a`, `b`, both positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^5). It performs the following actions: 

1. It calculates `g` as the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
2. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with adjusted values of `m`, `a`, and `b` (dividing each by `g`) and returns the result multiplied by `g`.
3. If `g` equals 1, it calculates `k` as `a + b - 1` and checks if `m` is less than `k`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers.
4. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it computes `sum_k`, the sum of the first `k` integers, and `sum_m`, the sum of integers from `k + 1` to `m`, then returns their combined total.

In cases where `m` is less than `k`, the function returns a specific sum of integers, while if `g` equals 1, it calculates combined sums based on `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns values other than 1 (beyond further recursive calls) and assumes valid positive integer inputs. The final state of the program, depending on the input values, results in the output being a calculated integer based on the specified logic.
