You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the code and see if it accurately implements the requirements.

### Problem Recap:
The frog can jump:
1. Forward by a fixed distance `a`
2. Backward by a fixed distance `b`

Starting from position 0, we need to compute how many distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]` for all `x` from `0` to `m`, and sum these values up.

### Code Explanation:
1. **GCD Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It uses the classic Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - Calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` to ensure that all valid positions the frog can reach can be normalized. If the GCD is greater than `1`, it scales down `a`, `b`, and `m` before processing further.
   - Computes `k`, the total reachable distinct positions below a certain threshold, managing the case when `m` is less than `k`.
   - Uses formulas to calculate the sum efficiently.

### Edges and Cases Analysis:
- It checks if the `g` (GCD) is not 1 and in such cases recursively computes the values after scaling down the variables.
- If `m` is less than `k`, it simply calculates based on triangular numbers.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Considering possible edge cases:
1. When `m` is small, e.g., `m = 1, a = 1, b = 1`. The frog can jump `1` step forward or `1` step back, resulting in reachable positions. The values of `f(0)` to `f(1)` should both be reachable.
2. When `a` is large, e.g., `m = 50, a = 100, b = 1`. The frog can't jump anywhere besides `0`, thus `f(0) = 1`, and for all i from `1` to `50`, also `f(i) should return 1`.
3. Testing the input `m = 6, a = 2, b = 2`. The frog can reach only `0` and `2` at max, we need to see if calculations align with expected results.

The function seems to handle cases based on the rules laid out, but:

Upon analyzing and testing a case like:
`m = 0, a = 5, b = 3`:
- `f(0) = 1`
So it returns `1`. This part is fine.
However, for all `i` from `1` to `m`, if `m = 0`... there shouldn't be a sum, since only the zero case exists.

Here, inconsistencies in how the program handles boundary cases could lead to unexpected results. The code does not correctly handle scenarios where m is less than both jumps or different bounding exceptions based on negative jumps. 

### Conclusion:
After thorough examination, the meaningful edge cases and calculations lead to various potential miscalculations where the rules of unilateral movement in bounds differ significantly.

Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to account for scenarios where movement restrictions lead to misconfigured summation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer, and y is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, where y is 0. Thus, the return value is x, which is the value of x itself.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 applied to the values m // g, a // g, and b // g, multiplied by g, using the initial values of m, a, b, and g, where g is the result of func_1(a, b) not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, and `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b).
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first m positive integers, which is calculated as (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m < a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b), `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns sum_k which is equal to (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 plus sum_m which is equal to m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
