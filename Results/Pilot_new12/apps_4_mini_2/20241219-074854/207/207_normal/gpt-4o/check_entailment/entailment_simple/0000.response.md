To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the problem requirements and how the program attempts to implement them.

### Problem Summary:
We need to compute a function \( f(x) \) for a frog that can jump either by adding \( a \) or subtracting \( b \) from its current position, starting from 0 and limited to the interval \([0, m]\). The goal is to find the sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Function Calculation**:
   - We need to evaluate how many distinct integers are reachable by the frog, given the jumping constraints and bounds of the number line defined by \( m \).
   - We need to calculate \( f(i) \) accurately for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \).

2. **Divisors and Reductions**:
   - The program uses a greatest common divisor (gcd) function to reduce \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \). This approach attempts to simplify cases where jumps can be reduced mathematically.
   - However, the logic applied within the function \( func_2 \) attempts to derive the count of reachable positions using \( a + b - 1 \), which focuses on determining valid reachable states by examining how many positions can be filled in ranges determined by \( a \) and \( b \).

### Analysis of the Code:
- `func_1` correctly calculates the gcd.
- `func_2(m, a, b)` checks if \( g \neq 1 \) and performs a recursive call, which is still logically sound but does not directly ensure correct counting of reachable positions in all cases.
- When \( m < k \) (where \( k = a + b - 1 \)), it performs a geometric sum which represents the total possible distinct positions until \( m \).
- However, when \( m \geq k \), it assumes a pattern using \( sum_k \) and \( sum_m \) without explicitly determining all reachable positions, especially in cases where \( m \) is much larger than both \( a \) and \( b \).

### Conclusion:
The approach does not accurately compute \( f(i) \) for each \( i \), particularly for large \( m \). The derived calculations may undercount the valid positions that can be accessed through all jumping sequences. The dependence on \( gcd \) and handling of state variables does not fully address the combinatorial nature of the jumps and reachability across the range.

Given the constraints and requirements, the logic presented does not guarantee correct results in all cases and can potentially lead to incorrect evaluations of \( f(i) \).

Therefore, the assessment of correctness for the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**
