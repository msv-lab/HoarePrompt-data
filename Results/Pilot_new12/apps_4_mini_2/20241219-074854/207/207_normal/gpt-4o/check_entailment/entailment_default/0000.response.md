To determine the correctness of the provided Python code according to the problem description and analysis of the outputs, let's closely examine both the functions and their output hints.

### Problem Description Overview:
The frog can jump Positive `a` or negative `b` from its current position on a number line. The function `f(x)` indicates the number of distinct integers reachable without jumping out of bounds [0, x]. The task requires calculating the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m`.

### Function Breakdown:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(x, y)`**
   - Calculates the GCD of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The logic of this function is sound and follows the mathematical principles for finding GCD.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(m, a, b)`**
   - Uses `func_1` to get the GCD `g`.
   - If `g` is not 1, the function recurses, adjusting `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`, and multiplies the return value by `g`. 
   - If `g` equals 1, it checks the threshold `k = a + b - 1` and reacts differently depending on whether `m < k` or not:
     - If `m < k`: returns sum of first `m + 1` integers.
     - If `m >= k`: calculates the sum of integers in two parts involving `sum_k` and `sum_m`.

### Output Hints:
- The hints clarify how the function operates, especially the special handling for cases based on the GCD and the conditions for `m` relative to `k`.

### Critical Analysis:
The output hints lead us to check edge cases:
- Edge case when `m` is very large relative to `k`.
- If `m < k`: Not covering all cases of reachable integers effectively.
- If `m` is very large and thus should provide a significant result (`m+1` terms counted) but might still be limited by the conditions for valid jumps defined by `a` and `b` when summed up.

### Missing Considerations:
- The function does not account for conditions where the frog may potentially overshoot valid reachable integers due to imbalanced jumping configurations (especially higher rates of `b` affecting counts). 
- Cases where `g` affects the `m` interrupting the flow should also be checked against lesser bounds (`m-g` scenarios).

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle each potential integer case correctly and comprehensively for various ranges. It assumes that all conditions based on `m`, `a`, and `b` always yield valid reachable integers under constraints but may fail in specific larger configurations or disproportionate ratios between `a` and `b`.

**Correctness: False.** 

Some cases (like the ones outlined above) demonstrate that the solution logic may fail under certain input scales as noted, thus violating completeness to the problem description as intended.
