To determine the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and potential edge cases:

The problem requires us to calculate the function \( f(x) \), which counts the distinct integers on a number line that the frog can reach by jumping \( +a \) or \( -b \) from the starting position \( 0 \). Subsequently, we want to compute the sum of all \( f(i) \) from \( 0 \) to \( m \).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_1(x, y)` implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2(m, a, b)` computes the desired sum from \( f(0) \) to \( f(m) \).

2. **GCD and Scaling:**
   - If the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) (denoted as \( g \)) is not \( 1 \), the function rescales \( m \), \( a \), and \( b \) by \( g \). This is valid since the frog's reach can be scaled up or down based on \( g \).

3. **Jump Logic:**
   - The variable `k` is defined as \( a + b - 1 \). The if condition checks if \( m < k \):
     - If true, it computes the sum of integers from \( 0 \) to \( m \), which fits the logic for counting reachable positions.
   - If \( m \) is greater than or equal to \( k \), the complete sum includes:
     - The sum of integers reachable using \( +a \) and \( -b \) adjustments, ensuring that all reachable positions are counted.

### Edge Cases and Counterexamples

Although the logic appears sound, the critical edge case arises from the relationships of \( a \) and \( b \) concerning the range \( [0, m] \).

1. **Negative Jump Overshoot:**
   If \( b \) is much larger than \( a \), then consider:
   - \( m = 0, a = 1, b = 10^5 \), the frog can only jump to \( 1 \) (i.e., only reachable position is \( 0 \)).
   - Thus, \( f(0) = 1 \), \( f(1) = 1 \), and for \( i \geq 2 \), \( f(i) \) needs proper analysis to see they remain limited.
   - The function may not compute the proper \( f(i) \) values based on wide ranges of \( m \).

2. **Divisibility:**
   When \( m \) is small (for example \( m = 2 \) with \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \)):
   - \( f(0)\) to \( f(2) \) needs specific checks to ensure each \( f(i) \) is computed as reachable distinct positions.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, based on the way \( f(i) \) is calculated and how the jumps are managed, it fails in specific edge cases where the relationship of \( a \) and \( b \) leads to over-counting or miscounting distinct integers due to boundary conditions.

Thus, we arrive at the conclusion regarding the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. For \( m \) values close to \( 0 \) or with specific \( a \) and \( b \) setups, it may yield incorrect results regarding how many distinct integers are truly reachable by the frog.
