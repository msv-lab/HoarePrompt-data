After carefully analyzing the problem description, the original program, the original assessment, and the provided annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment correctly identifies the shortcomings of the program.

### Key Points of Evaluation:

1. **Functionality**: The program aims to compute the sum of reachable distinct integers \( f(i) \) for \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( m \). The logic employed in `func_2` involves checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) and utilizing mathematical properties of sums, which it appears to implement correctly.

2. **Assumption Handling**: The program assumes valid inputs and does not cover every edge case explicitly. Specifically, it does not clarify the behavior of \( f(i) \) for all relationships between \( a \) and \( b \), which can lead to undercounting or overcounting reachable integers depending on how jumps are made. 

3. **Edge Cases**: The original assessment rightly emphasizes edge cases, such as when \( b \) is significantly larger than \( a \). This can lead to scenarios where \( f(i) \) could incorrectly reflect the count of reachable integers, due to the intricacies of the jumps allowed by the frog.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**: The annotated version of the code supports the assessment in demonstrating how the program operates. After checking the GCD, the computations of `sum_k` and `sum_m` do represent quantities based on the definition of \( f(i) \). However, limitations of \( a \) and \( b \) can still result in erroneous outputs, particularly when their scaling affects the range of integers that could be reached.

Given the analysis and the observations derived from both the original program and the annotated version, the conclusion remains that while the program's structure might be logically sound, it fails to account for every potential case that could arise from the jumping rules, leading to the possibility of incorrect summations for \( f(i) \).

### Final Assessment

The original assessment's points regarding edge case failures and inadequate treatment of boundary effects are still valid. Therefore, I maintain that the assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
