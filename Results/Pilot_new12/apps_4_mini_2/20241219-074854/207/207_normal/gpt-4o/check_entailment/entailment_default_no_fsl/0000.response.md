Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate `f(i)` for every possible integer `i` from `0` to `m` in the context of the frog's jumping capabilities and the constraints given in the problem description.

1. The function `func_2` checks for the gcd of `a` and `b`, which is a step in simplifying the problem, but it does not correctly handle all values of `m` effectively when `g=1`. Notably, the calculation of `f(i)` for every integer up to `m` is complex due to the possible combinations of jumps the frog can make.
   
2. The calculation of `k` as `a + b - 1` is correct in the context of backward jumps, but there could be particular values of `m`, `a`, or `b` where the calculations do not capture the full range of integers the frog can reach. Specifically, if the numbers do not provide a full coverage, the implementation fails to account for valid positions the frog may reach effectively.

3. There are specific edge cases that the code does not address. For instance, if `a` is much less than `b`, the effective jumps could result in limited reachable numbers for certain values of `m`, which is not captured correctly in the summation logic.

A potential counterexample could be evaluating inputs where `m = 5`, `a = 1`, `b = 6`. In this case, the reachable integers would not correctly reflect the sum of reachable integers the frog can hop to.

Overall, since not every potential case is being managed correctly, the statement of correctness is not met.
