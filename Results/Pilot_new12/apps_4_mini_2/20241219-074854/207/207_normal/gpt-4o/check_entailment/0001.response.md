To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the code and see if it accurately implements the requirements.

### Problem Recap:
The frog can jump:
1. Forward by a fixed distance `a`
2. Backward by a fixed distance `b`

Starting from position 0, we need to compute how many distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]` for all `x` from `0` to `m`, and sum these values up.

### Code Explanation:
1. **GCD Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It uses the classic Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - Calculates the GCD of `a` and `b` to ensure that all valid positions the frog can reach can be normalized. If the GCD is greater than `1`, it scales down `a`, `b`, and `m` before processing further.
   - Computes `k`, the total reachable distinct positions below a certain threshold, managing the case when `m` is less than `k`.
   - Uses formulas to calculate the sum efficiently.

### Edges and Cases Analysis:
- It checks if the `g` (GCD) is not 1 and in such cases recursively computes the values after scaling down the variables.
- If `m` is less than `k`, it simply calculates based on triangular numbers.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Considering possible edge cases:
1. When `m` is small, e.g., `m = 1, a = 1, b = 1`. The frog can jump `1` step forward or `1` step back, resulting in reachable positions. The values of `f(0)` to `f(1)` should both be reachable.
2. When `a` is large, e.g., `m = 50, a = 100, b = 1`. The frog can't jump anywhere besides `0`, thus `f(0) = 1`, and for all i from `1` to `50`, also `f(i) should return 1`.
3. Testing the input `m = 6, a = 2, b = 2`. The frog can reach only `0` and `2` at max, we need to see if calculations align with expected results.

The function seems to handle cases based on the rules laid out, but:

Upon analyzing and testing a case like:
`m = 0, a = 5, b = 3`:
- `f(0) = 1`
So it returns `1`. This part is fine.
However, for all `i` from `1` to `m`, if `m = 0`... there shouldn't be a sum, since only the zero case exists.

Here, inconsistencies in how the program handles boundary cases could lead to unexpected results. The code does not correctly handle scenarios where m is less than both jumps or different bounding exceptions based on negative jumps. 

### Conclusion:
After thorough examination, the meaningful edge cases and calculations lead to various potential miscalculations where the rules of unilateral movement in bounds differ significantly.

Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to account for scenarios where movement restrictions lead to misconfigured summation.
