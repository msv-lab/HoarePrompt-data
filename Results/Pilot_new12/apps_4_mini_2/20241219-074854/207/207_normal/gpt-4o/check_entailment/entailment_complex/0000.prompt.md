You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----

500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Annotated Functions:
(m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_2(m, a, b)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer, and y is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, where y is 0. Thus, the return value is x, which is the value of x itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function runs a loop that continues as long as `y` is not zero, repeatedly updating `x` with the value of `y` and `y` with the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The final state upon completion is that the function returns the GCD, which is the value in `x` when `y` reaches zero. It is important to note that if either input is zero, the function defaults to returning the other non-zero value, reflecting the mathematical principle that the GCD of zero and a non-zero integer is the non-zero integer itself.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 applied to the values m // g, a // g, and b // g, multiplied by g, using the initial values of m, a, b, and g, where g is the result of func_1(a, b) not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, and `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b).
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first m positive integers, which is calculated as (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2, where m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m < a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5, `g` is equal to 1, which is the result of func_1(a, b), `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns sum_k which is equal to (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 plus sum_m which is equal to m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, a positive integer (1 <= m <= 10^9), and `a`, `b`, both positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^5). It performs the following actions: 

1. It calculates `g` as the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
2. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with adjusted values of `m`, `a`, and `b` (dividing each by `g`) and returns the result multiplied by `g`.
3. If `g` equals 1, it calculates `k` as `a + b - 1` and checks if `m` is less than `k`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers.
4. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it computes `sum_k`, the sum of the first `k` integers, and `sum_m`, the sum of integers from `k + 1` to `m`, then returns their combined total.

In cases where `m` is less than `k`, the function returns a specific sum of integers, while if `g` equals 1, it calculates combined sums based on `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns values other than 1 (beyond further recursive calls) and assumes valid positive integer inputs. The final state of the program, depending on the input values, results in the output being a calculated integer based on the specified logic.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
