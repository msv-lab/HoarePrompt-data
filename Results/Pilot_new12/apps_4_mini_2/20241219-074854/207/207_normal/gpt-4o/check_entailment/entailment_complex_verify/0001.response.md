Final: **False**

The program fails to correctly account for all potential configurations and scenarios outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the original assessment correctly identified a potential issue in how the function handles edge cases, particularly when `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. 

The recursive nature of `func_2` and its reliance on the GCD can lead to cases where the counting of distinct positions (`f(i)`) is not handled correctly, especially for boundary cases. The program's approach to summation does not seem to ensure that all reachable positions are counted, resulting in incorrect total outputs in certain scenarios. 

Therefore, after thoroughly reviewing the program, the problem description, and the annotations, the conclusion remains that the implementation is flawed, leading to an overall incorrect assessment of the program's correctness.
