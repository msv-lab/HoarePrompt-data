After carefully analyzing the provided annotated version of the code along with the original assessment, I have come to a refined conclusion about the programâ€™s correctness.

1. **Functionality Overview**: The Frog problem requires the computation of how many distinct integers can be reached by a frog jumping according to defined rules, and the program aims to sum those values from `0` to `m`.

2. **GCD Normalization**: The program correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b` to normalize the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` whenever necessary. This ensures that the jumps made by the frog can reflect all reachable integers in proportional terms.

3. **Handling Cases**: 
   - When `g != 1`, the function invokes itself recursively with scaled parameters, which seems appropriate for handling jumps of multiple units and consolidating the calculations.
   - The logic differentiating between the case when `m < k` versus when `m` is larger ensures accurate computations for reachable integers below certain thresholds.
   - The program adeptly calculates triangular sums for the scenarios outlined in the problem description, efficiently summing the ranges required without unnecessary iterations.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The annotations detail that for lower values of `m` relative to `a` and `b`, the computations using summation formulas provide the correct number of integers reachable, thus reflecting the logic specified in the problem description.

5. **Assessment Validity**: The original assessment, while recognizing that edge cases needed to be carefully evaluated, did note the general correctness of the logical structure of `func_2`. Given the annotations affirm that the conditions for returning sums and counts are correctly handled in accordance with both the defined frog movements and mathematical reasoning around triangular numbers, my analysis aligns with the correctness attributed to the overall program logic.

Final: **True**
