To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we first need to closely analyze the problem description along with the code and the annotations provided.

### Problem Description Breakdown
The task is to calculate the sum of the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given its jumping behavior and constraints. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The function `f(x)` calculates how many distinct positions can be reached from 0 to `x` and we need to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from 0 to `m`.

### Analyzing the Code
The code is structured into two functions:
1. **func_1(x, y)** - This function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the two integers x and y.
2. **func_2(m, a, b)** - This function computes the required sum based on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.

#### Steps Taken By `func_2`:
1. It first calculates the GCD of `a` and `b`.
2. If GCD `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively reduces `m`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `g` equals 1, it calculates `k = a + b - 1`. 
4. If `m < k`, it returns the sum of integers from 0 to m.
5. If `m >= k`, it calculates the sum up to k and the additional values beyond k up to m.

### Edge Cases and Consideration of Correctness
- The core of the problem description conveys that the frog can reach positions depending on the behavior of jumps a and b. The function `func_2` needs to accurately compute the count of these reachable integers for all values up to `m`.
- The annotation mentions that if `g` is not 1, the function calls itself recursively, potentially altering the state of `m`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the function can handle cases where the inputs have common divisors correctly by normalizing them.

#### Analysis of the Key Conditions:
- In case when both `a` and `b` are large relative to `m`, we may risk underestimating reachable positions. The jump counting approach which relies heavily on GCD could fail on some edge cases when `m`, `a`, and `b` lead to jumps which do not explore all integers efficiently.
- The annotation that states how `func_2` computes the sums when `g` equals 1 or when `m` is less than `k` provides some insight. However, there could still be unique combinations of `a` and `b` that this structure may not handle optimally from the perspective of all reachable integers.

### Conclusion
After careful analysis, while the functions utilize recursive logic and mathematical properties (like GCD) to optimize the sum calculation, they could potentially overlook specific patterns in jumps leading to unreachable integers in versus the overall interval `[0, m]`. 

Specifically, for cases where the interval is constrained by the linear combinations of `a` and `b`, there may exist values in `[0, m]` that can't be reached based on the difference in `a` and `b` and their respective ranges.

Thus, the following conclusion is drawn:

Correctness: **False**

**Explanation**: The code potentially does not account for all reachable integers depending on the size and relationship of `a` and `b`, particularly in cases where `m` could be significantly less than `a + b - 1`. Therefore, there are cases (for instance, when both jumps are very large or very small relative to each other) where the frogs ability to reach certain integer points gets compromised, leading to incorrect results for `f(i)` and hence the return sum.
