You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and potential edge cases:

The problem requires us to calculate the function \( f(x) \), which counts the distinct integers on a number line that the frog can reach by jumping \( +a \) or \( -b \) from the starting position \( 0 \). Subsequently, we want to compute the sum of all \( f(i) \) from \( 0 \) to \( m \).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_1(x, y)` implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2(m, a, b)` computes the desired sum from \( f(0) \) to \( f(m) \).

2. **GCD and Scaling:**
   - If the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) (denoted as \( g \)) is not \( 1 \), the function rescales \( m \), \( a \), and \( b \) by \( g \). This is valid since the frog's reach can be scaled up or down based on \( g \).

3. **Jump Logic:**
   - The variable `k` is defined as \( a + b - 1 \). The if condition checks if \( m < k \):
     - If true, it computes the sum of integers from \( 0 \) to \( m \), which fits the logic for counting reachable positions.
   - If \( m \) is greater than or equal to \( k \), the complete sum includes:
     - The sum of integers reachable using \( +a \) and \( -b \) adjustments, ensuring that all reachable positions are counted.

### Edge Cases and Counterexamples

Although the logic appears sound, the critical edge case arises from the relationships of \( a \) and \( b \) concerning the range \( [0, m] \).

1. **Negative Jump Overshoot:**
   If \( b \) is much larger than \( a \), then consider:
   - \( m = 0, a = 1, b = 10^5 \), the frog can only jump to \( 1 \) (i.e., only reachable position is \( 0 \)).
   - Thus, \( f(0) = 1 \), \( f(1) = 1 \), and for \( i \geq 2 \), \( f(i) \) needs proper analysis to see they remain limited.
   - The function may not compute the proper \( f(i) \) values based on wide ranges of \( m \).

2. **Divisibility:**
   When \( m \) is small (for example \( m = 2 \) with \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \)):
   - \( f(0)\) to \( f(2) \) needs specific checks to ensure each \( f(i) \) is computed as reachable distinct positions.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, based on the way \( f(i) \) is calculated and how the jumps are managed, it fails in specific edge cases where the relationship of \( a \) and \( b \) leads to over-counting or miscounting distinct integers due to boundary conditions.

Thus, we arrive at the conclusion regarding the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. For \( m \) values close to \( 0 \) or with specific \( a \) and \( b \) setups, it may yield incorrect results regarding how many distinct integers are truly reachable by the frog.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, a positive integer (1 <= m <= 10^9), and `a`, `b`, both positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^5). It performs the following actions: 

1. It calculates `g` as the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
2. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with adjusted values of `m`, `a`, and `b` (dividing each by `g`) and returns the result multiplied by `g`.
3. If `g` equals 1, it calculates `k` as `a + b - 1` and checks if `m` is less than `k`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers.
4. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it computes `sum_k`, the sum of the first `k` integers, and `sum_m`, the sum of integers from `k + 1` to `m`, then returns their combined total.

In cases where `m` is less than `k`, the function returns a specific sum of integers, while if `g` equals 1, it calculates combined sums based on `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns values other than 1 (beyond further recursive calls) and assumes valid positive integer inputs. The final state of the program, depending on the input values, results in the output being a calculated integer based on the specified logic.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
