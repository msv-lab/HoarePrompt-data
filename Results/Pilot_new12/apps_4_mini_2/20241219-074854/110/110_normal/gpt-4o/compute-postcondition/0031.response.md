After executing the code `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)`, the following changes occur:

- The variable `heap` is affected as the first tuple (which contains the minimum coverage value along with the corresponding coordinates) is removed from it.
- The tuple `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')` that was previously at the top of the `heap` is now unpacked into `cov`, `x`, and `y`. 
- Since `total_coverage` is `-cov`, if `cov` changed, the value of `total_coverage` will also be impacted.

Since `heap` originally contained `n*m - 1` tuples, after the operation, it will now have `n*m - 2` tuples remaining.

The output state reflects these changes. Thus, the output will state the updated information about `cov`, `x`, `y`, and the state of the `heap`.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `heap` contains `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')`, `total_coverage` is `-cov`, `cov` is the coverage value extracted from the heap, `x` is the x-coordinate extracted from the heap, `y` is the y-coordinate extracted from the heap.**
