According to the code, the loop executes `k` times, where `k` must be greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is still the same integer value representing the total number of iterations the loop will run.

Since the loop has executed `k` times, for it to execute one more time, `k` must increase by 1. Hence, `k` should now be greater than or equal to 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `total_coverage` is `-2 * cov`, where `cov` is the coverage value extracted from the heap. However, since the overall state regarding `coverages`, `n`, `m`, `heap`, and `r` remain unchanged, only the value of `k` needs to be updated for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `heap` contains `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')`, `total_coverage` is now `-2*cov`, `cov` is the coverage value extracted from the heap, `x` is the x-coordinate extracted from the heap, `y` is the y-coordinate extracted from the heap.**
