Functionality: **The function `func_1` calculates the average coverage of a pond of dimensions `n` by `m` after placing `k` distinct fishes at positions within the pond. It first creates a max-heap of coverage values based on positions within the pond, using a negative value to facilitate max-heap behavior. It then extracts the top `k` coverage values from the heap, summing them into `total_coverage`. The final result returned is the average coverage, computed as `total_coverage` divided by `total_positions`, where `total_positions` is the count of potential placements for a scoop of size `r` within the dimensions `n` and `m`. 

Edge cases include:
- If `k` is greater than the number of possible positions in the heap, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors since `k` is expected to be less than or equal to `n*m`.
- If either `n` or `m` is less than `r`, which would make `total_positions` zero or negative, leading to a division by zero scenario. The function does not handle this edge case, making it potentially unsafe for certain input values.
- The function assumes that the function `coverage(x, y)` is defined elsewhere and returns a valid coverage value; if it's not defined or leads to unexpected behavior, the function's results will also be affected. However, there is no check for the validity of coverage values before summing. 

Overall, the function calculates coverage but lacks validity checks for input dimensions and the coverage function.**
