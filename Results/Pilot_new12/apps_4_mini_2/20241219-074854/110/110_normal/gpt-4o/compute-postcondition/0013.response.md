To evaluate the impact of the provided code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))`, we first need to identify the variables involved and their current conditions. 

1. **Variables involved:** 
   - `x`: has a value of `1`
   - `y`: has a value of `1`
   - `heap`: is the original list with an additional tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` added.
   - `coverage(x, y)`: this function call will determine the value that should be negated to form the first element of the tuple being pushed onto the heap.

2. **Changes made by the code:** 
   - The function `coverage(x, y)` will be called with `x = 1` and `y = 1`. Therefore, the result of `coverage(1, 1)` needs to be calculated.
   - The first element of the tuple being added to `heap` will be `-coverage(1, 1)`, the second element will be `x`, which is `1`, and the third element will be `y`, which is also `1`.
   - The current state of `heap` will now have this new tuple added to it.

After running the line of code, we have modified the `heap` by pushing the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `heap` now includes the tuple `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, `y` is 1.**
