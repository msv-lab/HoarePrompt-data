The function `coverage` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `r`. Both `x` and `y` are integers representing coordinates in the pond, with the constraints that \( 0 \leq x < n \) and \( 0 \leq y < m \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are also integers that satisfy \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5 \). The parameter `r` is an integer representing a radius, constrained such that \( 1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m) \). The function returns the product of the dimensions defined by these constraints, reflecting the area of valid coordinates in the pond. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and r, and returns the area of valid coordinates in the pond based on the dimensions defined by the constraints on x, y, n, m, and r.**
