The `heapq.heappush` function adds a new element to the heap. In this case, the new element consists of a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. The value of `coverage(x, y)` will be calculated based on the specific case, but it will be negated for max-heap behavior.

1. `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, thus the expression becomes `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`.
2. The current state of `heap` contains two tuples: 
   - The first tuple is `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`.
   - The second tuple is `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`.
3. After executing the `heapq.heappush` operation, a new tuple `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)` is appended to the existing list `heap`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`) remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `heap` is a list containing tuples (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), (-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1), and (-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2), `y` is 2**.
