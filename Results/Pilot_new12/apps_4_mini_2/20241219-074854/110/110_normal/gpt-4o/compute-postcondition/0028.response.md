The statement `cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap, which holds tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. This means it will remove and assign the first tuple from `heap`, which corresponds to the maximum coverage value (since coverage is negated in the heap).

Here, `cov` will be assigned `-coverage(x, y)`, meaning `cov` will now hold the coverage value (as it was stored as a negative value in the heap), and `x` and `y` will hold the respective coordinates.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `heap`, and `total_coverage`) will remain unchanged besides the fact that `heap` will contain one less tuple after the `heappop()` operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updates made to `cov`, `x`, and `y` while maintaining the original information regarding the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `heap` contains `n*m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')` for all remaining `0 ≤ x' < n` and `0 ≤ y' < m`, `total_coverage` is 0; `cov` is the coverage value, `x` is the x-coordinate, `y` is the y-coordinate.**
