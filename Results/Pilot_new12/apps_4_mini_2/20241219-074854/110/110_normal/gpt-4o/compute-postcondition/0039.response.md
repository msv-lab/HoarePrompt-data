The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. All parameters are integers, where `n` and `m` represent the dimensions of the pond with constraints that they must each be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. The parameter `r` represents the size of the scoop and must be between 1 and the minimum of `n` and `m`. The parameter `k` represents the number of fishes to be placed in distinct cells, constrained to be between 1 and the minimum of the product of `n` and `m`, as well as 100,000.

The function computes a result based on the total coverage and total positions in the pond. Specifically, it returns the value of `total_coverage` divided by `total_positions`, where `total_coverage` is the sum of negative coverage values of the `k` tuples extracted, and `total_positions` is calculated as `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, and returns the result of total_coverage divided by total_positions.**
