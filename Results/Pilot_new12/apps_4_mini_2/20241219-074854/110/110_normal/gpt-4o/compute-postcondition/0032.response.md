The statement `total_coverage -= cov` modifies the value of `total_coverage` by subtracting `cov` from it. The precondition states that `total_coverage` is currently `-cov`, so performing this operation will result in `total_coverage` being updated to `-cov - cov`, which simplifies to `-2*cov`. The other variables are not affected by this operation, as it is solely focused on modifying `total_coverage`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total_coverage` while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `heap` contains `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')`, `total_coverage` is now `-2*cov`, `cov` is the coverage value extracted from the heap, `x` is the x-coordinate extracted from the heap, `y` is the y-coordinate extracted from the heap.**
