The variable `total_coverage` is assigned the value `0`, indicating that the total coverage is initialized to zero. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, and `heap` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `heap` contains `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ x < n` and `0 ≤ y < m`; `total_coverage` is 0.**
