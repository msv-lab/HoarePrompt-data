To determine the output state based on the initial conditions and the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the calculations performed in the return statement.

1. **Variables Description**:
   - `x` and `y`: Integer coordinates within the pond.
   - `n`: Total rows in the pond.
   - `m`: Total columns in the pond.
   - `r`: Radius that affects how the coordinates are interpreted within the pond's boundaries.

2. **Calculations**:
   - The formula computes the area considering the constraints of the pond's dimensions and the radius `r`.
   - The terms used in the computation are:
     - **Horizontal dimension**:
       - `min(x + 1, n - r + 1)`: This term gives the upper boundary for the x-coordinate given the pond’s size and the radius.
       - `max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)`: This term gives the lower boundary for the x-coordinate, ensuring it does not go below 0.
     - **Vertical dimension**:
       - `min(y + 1, m - r + 1)`: Similar to the above but for the y-coordinate.
       - `max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0)`: Similar approach as with x for the y-coordinate’s lower boundary.

3. **Overall Impact**:
   - The overall return computes the area by multiplying the horizontal extent (calculated from x) with the vertical extent (calculated from y).
   - The calculations yield a result that reflects a rectangular area defined by the modified boundaries influenced by x, y, n, m, and r.

Given the conditions above, the output of the program based on the calculations results in:

Output State: **The program returns the product of the dimensions defined by the constraints on x and y, influenced by n, m, and r, reflecting the area of the valid coordinates in the pond.**
