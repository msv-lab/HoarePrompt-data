The code `total_coverage -= cov` updates the value of `total_coverage` by subtracting `cov` from it. The initial value of `total_coverage` is 0, so after executing the code, `total_coverage` will be equal to `0 - cov`, which simplifies to `-cov`. Moreover, the values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `heap`, `cov`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `heap` contains `n*m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')` for all remaining `0 ≤ x' < n` and `0 ≤ y' < m`, `total_coverage` is `-cov`; `cov` is the coverage value, `x` is the x-coordinate, `y` is the y-coordinate.**
