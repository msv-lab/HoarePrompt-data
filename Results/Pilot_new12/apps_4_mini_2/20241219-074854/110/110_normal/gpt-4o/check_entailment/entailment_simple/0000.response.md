To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in accordance with the given problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program logic line by line.

### Problem Requirements Recap:

1. The program must find the optimal placement of `k` fishes within an `n x m` pond.
2. The scoop size is `r x r`, and it must fit entirely within the pond.
3. The objective is to maximize the expected number of fishes caught when the scoop is placed randomly in the pond.

### Program Logic Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   The program reads four integers `n, m, r, k`, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   The program uses a min-heap (`heapq`) to store tuples of coverage (the number of potential positions a scoop can catch fishes if placed at that cell) with the purpose of selecting the top `k` cells for optimal fish placement later.

3. **Coverage Function**:
   The function `coverage(x, y)` calculates how many positions can be occupied by a scoop that is placed with its lower-left corner at position `(x, y)`. It relies on both `n`, `m`, and `r` to ensure calculations are constrained within bounds.

4. **Selecting Cells for Fish Placement**:
   The program iterates through every possible position in the pond (`n * m`), calculates coverage for each cell, and builds a heap containing negative coverage values (for max-heap behavior). Then it pops the top `k` entries off the heap, summing their coverage values.

5. **Calculating the Expected Value**:
   The expected value of caught fish is calculated by dividing the sum of the coverage values obtained from the previously chosen positions by the total valid scoop positions, `total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

6. **Floating Point Precision**:
   The result is formatted to ten decimal places, as the problem states precision requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program logic aligns well with the requirements of the problem. It correctly implements an algorithm to maximize fish placement with respect to the expected scoop coverage, ensuring that all edge cases (valid positions for fish placement) are appropriately managed through coordinate checks.

Given that the algorithm effectively calculates the maximum expected number of caught fishes based on the placement of `k` fishes in a pond with constraints provided by `r`, the program meets all of the problem specifications and provides accurate, formatted output.

### Correctness:

Thus, based on this thorough analysis:

Correctness: **True**
