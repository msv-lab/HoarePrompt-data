Correctness: **False**.

The code may produce incorrect results, especially in edge cases relating to the placement of the fishes and potential positions for the scoop-net. 

1. The `total_positions` is calculated as `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, but if either `n` or `m` is less than `r`, this value will become zero or negative, causing a division by zero situation in the return statement. This is a critical failure point that is not handled in the code, thus potentially leading to runtime errors.

2. The handling of the heap and coverage logic in `func_1` assumes that the function `coverage(x, y)` works as intended in all cases. However, as noted, this function relies on the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` but does not directly validate if `x` and `y` are within the bounds that would prevent overflow or out-of-bounds issues in practice. There is no safeguard against invalid configurations based on the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, and `r`.

Given these considerations, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for every potential valid input scenario as outlined in the problem description.
