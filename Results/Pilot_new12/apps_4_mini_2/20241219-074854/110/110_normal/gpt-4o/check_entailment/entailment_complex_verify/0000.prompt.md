You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the core logic of the code to ensure it adheres to the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a pond of dimensions `n x m`.
   - We introduce `k` fishes into this pond in such a way that when a scoop of size `r x r` is positioned randomly over the pond, we want to maximize the expected number of fishes caught.
   - The scoop must fit entirely within the pond.

2. **How the Program Works:**
   - The program calculates the coverage of placing the scoop at different positions `(x, y)`, using a function `coverage(x, y)`.
   - It utilizes a max-heap to select the `k` positions with the highest coverage (i.e., the positions that would catch the most fishes).
   - `total_coverage` is then calculated based on the sum of the highest coverage positions divided by the total possible positions (which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`).

3. **Points of Concern:**
   - The `coverage` function might incorrectly calculate the number of positions from which fishes can be caught.
   - We need to ensure that the indices used in `coverage(x, y)` are correctly written and do not lead to negative counts or out-of-bound errors, particularly regarding how coverage is calculated using `min` and `max`.

4. **Testing the Code:**
   - Evaluate edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `1`, checking if the program can still select positions correctly.
   - Consider boundaries where `n`, `m`, and `r` are equal or where `k` is maximum per the constraints.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1: Minimum Input Values**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: Since there's only one cell, the expected number of caught fishes should be `1.0000000000`.
  
- **Case 2: When `k` is greater than available valid positions**
  - Input: `2 2 2 4`
  - All cells will be filled when the scoop can only occupy 1 position if overlapping. This scenario needs checking in logic.

By testing such edge cases, if it’s found that there exists any input where the program does not successfully return the expected output, then the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
After contemplating these factors, it appears that the logic of the program has inconsistencies regarding the exact coverage calculations, particularly how the `coverage` function reads the parameters. The use of indices does not clearly ensure proper calculations across all grid configurations.

Thus:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the pond (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000), r is an integer representing the size of the scoop (1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)), and k is an integer representing the number of fishes to be placed in distinct cells (1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100000)).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `heap` contains `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all `0 ≤ x < n` and `0 ≤ y < m`.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `m` is the original integer dimension of the pond, `r` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `total_coverage` is equal to the sum of negative coverage values of the `k` tuples extracted, `heap` contains `n*m - k` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x', y'), x', y')` for all remaining `0 ≤ x' < n` and `0 ≤ y' < m`.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the result of total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_coverage is the sum of negative coverage values of the k tuples extracted and total_positions is equal to (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates the average coverage of a pond of dimensions `n` by `m` after placing `k` distinct fishes at positions within the pond. It first creates a max-heap of coverage values based on positions within the pond, using a negative value to facilitate max-heap behavior. It then extracts the top `k` coverage values from the heap, summing them into `total_coverage`. The final result returned is the average coverage, computed as `total_coverage` divided by `total_positions`, where `total_positions` is the count of potential placements for a scoop of size `r` within the dimensions `n` and `m`. 

Edge cases include:
- If `k` is greater than the number of possible positions in the heap, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors since `k` is expected to be less than or equal to `n*m`.
- If either `n` or `m` is less than `r`, which would make `total_positions` zero or negative, leading to a division by zero scenario. The function does not handle this edge case, making it potentially unsafe for certain input values.
- The function assumes that the function `coverage(x, y)` is defined elsewhere and returns a valid coverage value; if it's not defined or leads to unexpected behavior, the function's results will also be affected. However, there is no check for the validity of coverage values before summing. 

Overall, the function calculates coverage but lacks validity checks for input dimensions and the coverage function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing coordinates in the pond such that 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, and n, m, and r are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the product of the dimensions defined by the constraints on x and y, influenced by n, m, and r, reflecting the area of the valid coordinates in the pond.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `coverage` accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which represent coordinates in a grid constrained by dimensions `n` and `m`, as well as a range parameter `r`. It calculates and returns the area of valid coordinates in a pond, influenced by these parameters. Specifically, it computes the effective dimensions based on the specified coordinates and range, ensuring that the calculations do not exceed the grid boundaries defined by `n` and `m`. This involves determining how far the coordinates `x` and `y` can extend in all directions (up to a distance of `r`), constrained to remain within the valid grid limits. The function handles edge cases where the coordinates are close to the edges of the grid, ensuring no out-of-bounds access occurs. The final output is the product of the computed dimensions representing the valid area covered by the pond as constrained by `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`.
