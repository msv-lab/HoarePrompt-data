You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the core logic of the code to ensure it adheres to the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a pond of dimensions `n x m`.
   - We introduce `k` fishes into this pond in such a way that when a scoop of size `r x r` is positioned randomly over the pond, we want to maximize the expected number of fishes caught.
   - The scoop must fit entirely within the pond.

2. **How the Program Works:**
   - The program calculates the coverage of placing the scoop at different positions `(x, y)`, using a function `coverage(x, y)`.
   - It utilizes a max-heap to select the `k` positions with the highest coverage (i.e., the positions that would catch the most fishes).
   - `total_coverage` is then calculated based on the sum of the highest coverage positions divided by the total possible positions (which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`).

3. **Points of Concern:**
   - The `coverage` function might incorrectly calculate the number of positions from which fishes can be caught.
   - We need to ensure that the indices used in `coverage(x, y)` are correctly written and do not lead to negative counts or out-of-bound errors, particularly regarding how coverage is calculated using `min` and `max`.

4. **Testing the Code:**
   - Evaluate edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `1`, checking if the program can still select positions correctly.
   - Consider boundaries where `n`, `m`, and `r` are equal or where `k` is maximum per the constraints.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1: Minimum Input Values**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: Since there's only one cell, the expected number of caught fishes should be `1.0000000000`.
  
- **Case 2: When `k` is greater than available valid positions**
  - Input: `2 2 2 4`
  - All cells will be filled when the scoop can only occupy 1 position if overlapping. This scenario needs checking in logic.

By testing such edge cases, if it’s found that there exists any input where the program does not successfully return the expected output, then the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
After contemplating these factors, it appears that the logic of the program has inconsistencies regarding the exact coverage calculations, particularly how the `coverage` function reads the parameters. The use of indices does not clearly ensure proper calculations across all grid configurations.

Thus:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `coverage` accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which represent coordinates in a grid constrained by dimensions `n` and `m`, as well as a range parameter `r`. It calculates and returns the area of valid coordinates in a pond, influenced by these parameters. Specifically, it computes the effective dimensions based on the specified coordinates and range, ensuring that the calculations do not exceed the grid boundaries defined by `n` and `m`. This involves determining how far the coordinates `x` and `y` can extend in all directions (up to a distance of `r`), constrained to remain within the valid grid limits. The function handles edge cases where the coordinates are close to the edges of the grid, ensuring no out-of-bounds access occurs. The final output is the product of the computed dimensions representing the valid area covered by the pond as constrained by `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
