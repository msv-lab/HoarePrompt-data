The function `func` accepts no parameters directly as it has no input arguments specified. Based on the provided output framework, there is no specific description of output or return value given. Without details on how the function processes or generates output, we cannot derive the functionality in regard to the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` remains undefined or requires further context to determine what it computes or returns.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and its return value is not specified.**
