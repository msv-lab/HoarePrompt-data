The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the minimum between `k` and the product of the two expressions `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. Given the constraints `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`, `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)`, we can determine that both products `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)` will yield valid positive integer results that can further be utilized in the computation of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))**
