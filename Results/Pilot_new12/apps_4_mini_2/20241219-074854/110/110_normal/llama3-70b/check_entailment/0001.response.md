Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected number of caught fishes based on the problem description. The main issue lies in how it calculates the result.

The expected number of caught fishes when placing the scoop in random positions requires not just the `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, which merely limits the number of fish based on either the maximum that can be placed or the number of positions, but also takes into account the actual area covered by the scoop.

To provide a clear counter-example, consider the input:

```
n = 3, m = 3, r = 2, k = 3
```

According to the problem, the expected value should be the maximum average number of fishes based on valid scoop positions. The correct expected number formula should have taken into consideration the size of the scoop and the distribution of fishes within that scoop area.

With this particular input, there are `(3 - 2 + 1) * (3 - 2 + 1) = 2` positions for the scoop, and if we can place all 3 fish optimally into the pond, the expected number of fish caught would be calculated as:

- Placing fish in positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) allows for the scoop in positions where it catches two fishes.

However, the actual answer returned by the program will be:

```python
ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)) / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
```

Which for our input will return `2 / 2 = 1.0`, which is incorrect as the expected value should be `2.0`.

Thus the program does not account for the proper distribution and averaging of fishes across different scooping positions and is therefore incorrect.
