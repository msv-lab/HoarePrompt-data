Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description regarding how to compute the expected number of caught fishes when placed in the pond. It attempts to compute the expected value by simply dividing the number of occupied cells (the minimum of `k` and the total number of positions available) by the total number of possible positions of the square scoop-net. However, the expected value should be computed based on the proportion of the area occupied by the fishes within the range of effective scoop positions.

A straightforward counterexample illustrates this flaw: 

Consider the input `3 3 2 2`. 
- The allowed positions for the r√ór scoop are `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`, and `(2,2)`, which gives a total of 4 valid positions.
- If we were to select 2 cells to place the fishes, placing them in two adjacent cells, say `(2,1)` and `(2,2)`, would yield an expected value of 2 because all 4 positions would result in 2 caught fishes.

However, the program will output `0.5000000000`, incorrectly assuming that the maximum density is calculated merely by the minimum of `k` and areas covered without considering how many fishes are effectively in the scoop area at each possible scoop position. 

This demonstrates that the program fails to calculate the expected values correctly for multiple configurations and edge cases where the placement of fishes will vary depending on arrangements, leading to a significant miscalculation. Thus, the program is incorrect concerning the problem requirements.
