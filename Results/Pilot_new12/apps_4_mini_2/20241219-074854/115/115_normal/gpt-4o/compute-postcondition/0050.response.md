Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `A[i][j]` is not equal to the current value of `B[i][j]` (which is 0).***
