The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. Both `n` and `m` are integers constrained between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers (with values either 0 or 1) having dimensions `n x m`. After executing the function body, in all cases (Case 1 through Case 9), the function consistently returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m` along with a 2D list `A`, and it always returns -1 regardless of the input values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m (both integers) and A (a 2D list of integers), and it always returns -1.**
