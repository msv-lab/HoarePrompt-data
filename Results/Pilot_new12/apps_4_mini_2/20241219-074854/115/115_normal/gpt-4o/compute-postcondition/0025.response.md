The variable `operations` is updated by appending a new tuple to it. The values of `i` and `j` are both 1, so the tuple being appended is `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which equals `(2, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` contains a tuple (2, 1) and (2, 2); `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all initialized to 0, except `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[1][2]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, `B[2][2]` = 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1.**
