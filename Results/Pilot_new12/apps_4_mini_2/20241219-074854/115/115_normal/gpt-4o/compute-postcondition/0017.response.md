According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means there are still more iterations available since `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1, becoming 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for this condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` will contain tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s, `B` will have 1s in positions corresponding to all found 2x2 blocks, otherwise `B` will remain a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 1**
