Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements in the first row are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]`, indicating that all corresponding elements in `A` and `B` at the row `i` are equal.***
