Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0; if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1, then B[n-1][0] = 1, B[n-1][1] = 1, B[n][0] = 1, B[n][1] = 1, and operations now includes the tuple (n, 1).***
