After executing the code, the elements in the 2D list `B` at the indices specified will be updated to 1. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, the following updates will occur:

- `B[0][0]` will be set to 1.
- `B[0][1]` will be set to 1.
- `B[1][0]` will be set to 1.
- `B[1][1]` will be set to 1.

As a result, `B` will now contain ones in the specified indices, creating a 2x2 block of ones starting from the top-left corner at `B[0][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged from the initial state, except for `B`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, and `B` has elements updated to 1 in the positions B[0][0], B[0][1], B[1][0], and B[1][1]; `i` is 0, `j` is 0**.
