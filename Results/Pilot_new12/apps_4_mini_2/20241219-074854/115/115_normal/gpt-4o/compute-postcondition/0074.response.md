Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements in the first row are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]` for each j from 0 to m-1. The value of `A[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `B[i][j]` at the current indices, specifically `A[2][0]` is not equal to `B[2][0]`.***
