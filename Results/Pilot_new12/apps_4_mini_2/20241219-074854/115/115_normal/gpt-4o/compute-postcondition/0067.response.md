Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within the range of 2 to 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers where all elements in the first row are equal to 0 and all elements in `B` are 0, `i` and `j` are both equal to 1, and the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1; otherwise, the function proceeds without any return statement.***
