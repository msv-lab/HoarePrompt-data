Let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step. We have:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 50\).
- `i` is defined as \(n - 1\).
- `j` is initialized to 1.

The operation being performed is:
```
B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
```
This sets multiple entries in a 2D array (or grid) `B` to the value of 1 based on the indices calculated from `i` and `j`.

Impacts of the code:
1. `B[i][j]` will be set to 1, which means the cell in the grid at position \((n-1, 1)\) is now 1.
2. `B[i][j + 1]` will also change, setting the cell in the grid at position \((n-1, 2)\) to 1.
3. `B[i + 1][j]` means setting the cell in the grid at position \((n, 1)\) to 1.
4. Lastly, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` sets the cell in the grid at position \((n, 2)\) to 1.

After executing the code, the dimensions of the grid `B` are affected, as the values at specific indices have been altered to 1.

The states of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged by this operation. The values of `B` at specific indices are updated. 

Thus, the output state should capture this information along with the previous valid states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 1; B[n-1][1] = 1; B[n-1][2] = 1; B[n][1] = 1; B[n][2] = 1**
