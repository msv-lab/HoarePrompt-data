According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains a tuple (2, 1), `B` remains a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
