According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which implies that the loop has executed for `j = 0` and `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

Thus, the updated states should reflect `j` being increased and the requirement for `m`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` contains a tuple (2, 1) and (2, 2); `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all initialized to 0, except `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[1][2]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, `B[2][2]` = 1; `i` is 1 and `j` is 2.**
