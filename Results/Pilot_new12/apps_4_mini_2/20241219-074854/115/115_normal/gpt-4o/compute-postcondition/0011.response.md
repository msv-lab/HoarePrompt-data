Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`. If `A[0][1]` and `A[0][2]`, `A[1][1]`, and `A[1][2]` are all equal to 1, `operations` includes (1, 1), (1, 2), and `B` has elements updated to 1 in positions `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][0]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]`. Otherwise, the state of `B` remains unchanged in the context of the if statement.***
