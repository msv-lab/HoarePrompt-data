Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` contains tuples (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3); `B` is a 2D list of integers such that `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, `B[1][3] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[2][2] = 1`, `B[2][3] = 1`; `i` is 1; `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the tuples (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) get added to `operations` and `B` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as no else part is defined.***
