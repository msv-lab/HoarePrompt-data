In the provided code snippet, we are indexing into the 2D list `B` at the specified positions based on the values of `i` and `j`. The states of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` will be updated to 1.

Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the indices being modified are:
- `B[0][1]`
- `B[0][2]` (since `j + 1` is `1 + 1`)
- `B[1][1]`
- `B[1][2]` (since `j + 1` is `1 + 1`)

The elements at those positions in the 2D list `B` will all be set to 1.

Now, let's reaffirm the precondition of the variables:
1. `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
2. `m` remains greater than or equal to 2.
3. `A` remains a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`.
4. `operations` includes (1, 1).
5. `B` will have updated values at the specified indices.
6. `i` is 0.
7. `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` includes (1, 1), `B` has elements updated to 1 in positions `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][0]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]`; `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**
