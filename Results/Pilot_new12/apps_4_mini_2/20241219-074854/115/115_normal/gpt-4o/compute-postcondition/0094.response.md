Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers (either 0 or 1) with dimensions `n x m`, where `2 <= n, m <= 50`. It identifies all 2x2 blocks within `A` that are filled with 1s and logs their top-left coordinates in the `operations` list. After scanning through the input list `A`, the function creates a new list `B` to represent these blocks, marking their positions with 1s. It then compares `A` with `B`. If any element in `A` does not match the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1, indicating an inconsistency. Ultimately, the function only ever returns -1 regardless of the input, and it also prints the count of found 2x2 blocks of 1s and their coordinates, but these outputs do not influence the return value. Additionally, the implementation does not handle cases where `A` does not contain any 2x2 blocks or if it contains any 1s, as it every time returns -1 under the current logic.**
