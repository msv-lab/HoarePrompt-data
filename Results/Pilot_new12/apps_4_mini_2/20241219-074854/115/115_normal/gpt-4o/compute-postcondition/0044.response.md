The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The previous values of the variables are `i = n - 1` and `j = 2`. Therefore, `i + 1 = n` and `j + 1 = 3`. The tuple appended to the `operations` list will be `(n, 3)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 2; `B[n-1][2] = 1`, `B[n-1][3] = 1`, `B[n][2] = 1`, `B[n][3] = 1`; `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 3)`**.
