Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` includes (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i + 1, 2); `B` has elements `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][0]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` set to `1`; `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then the corresponding operations using (i + 1, 2) will be executed.***
