According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and since `m` is between 2 and 50, `m - 1` is between 1 and 49. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1, making it 2. To ensure the loop executes again, `m` must be greater than 2 since `j` will need to be less than `m - 1`, which implies that `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 2**
