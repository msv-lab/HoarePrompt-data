According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and since the maximum limit for `j` is `m - 1`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented from 0 to 1.

Given that the loop will proceed to the next iteration, the states will be updated as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` includes (1, 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` with elements updated to 1 in positions `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]`; `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
