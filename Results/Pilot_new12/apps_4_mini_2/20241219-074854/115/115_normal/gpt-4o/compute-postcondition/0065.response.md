According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and the constraints dictate that `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 50, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increase by 1.

Thus, the next value of `j` will be 1. Since `m` must still satisfy the condition that it is at least 2, the loop can proceed successfully.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements in the first row are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal.**
