To analyze the output state after the loop executes, we must consider the conditions for the loop and the relationships between the variables involved.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, operations contains tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s in `A`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 0.

The for loop checks each element in the first row (i=0) of the 2D arrays `A` and `B`.

The conditions for the loop to execute fully are that both `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` at each index `j` must be equal. Since `B` consists of all zeros, the row `i=0` of `A` must also consist of all zeros for each `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

After executing all iterations, the variables will show the following:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements in the first row are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`. If at any point `A[0][j]` is not equal to `B[0][j]`, the function would return -1, but since we executed all iterations, `A[0][j]` must equal `B[0][j]`, which confirms that the first row of `A` is all zeros.**
