The variable `operations` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `m`, which are integers between 2 and 50, remain unchanged. The 2D list `A` continues to exist as specified but is not impacted by the initialization of `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, with dimensions n x m, `operations` is an empty list**.
