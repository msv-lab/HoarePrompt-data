Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, `operations` must be defined and contain at least one element, and `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed (the first two elements of `operations`).**
