The code snippet prints the first two elements of the variable `op`, which is the third element in the `operations` list. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by the print statement, but the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` will be printed out as output. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, `operations` is defined and contains at least 3 elements, `op` is the third element in `operations` and the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` were printed.**
