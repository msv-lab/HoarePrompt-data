Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` will contain tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s, `B` will have 1s in positions corresponding to the found 2x2 block at indices `B[1][0]`, `B[1][1]`, `B[2][0]`, and `B[2][1]`; otherwise `B` will remain a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0.**
