Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, `operations` is defined and contains elements of variable length; all elements in `operations` are printed sequentially for each iteration, until the last element is reached, with the loop executed exactly `len(operations)` times.**
