Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within the range of 2 to 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers where all elements in the first row are equal to 0 and all elements of `B` are 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal; if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the outcome of the else part is not defined since there is no else statement.***
