The code snippet `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple to the list `operations`. The tuple contains the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `1`

The values of `i` and `j` can be calculated:
- `i` = `n - 1`
- `j` = `1`

So the tuple will evaluate to:
- `i + 1` = `(n - 1) + 1` = `n`
- `j + 1` = `1 + 1` = `2`

Thus, the tuple `(n, 2)` will be appended to the list `operations`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is `1`; `operations` now contains `(n, 2)`.**
