To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information carefully.

1. The loop iterates `i` from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute:
   - `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Since `n` is between 2 and 50, there will always be at least one iteration.

2. The essential states to consider here are the values of `n` and `i`:
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should ideally be set to `0`, as that is the initial value of `i` in the `range(n)`.

3. The other variables, `m`, `A`, `operations`, and `B`, are not required to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the loop's execution itself only depends on `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute correctly:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, operations contains tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s in `A`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 0**
