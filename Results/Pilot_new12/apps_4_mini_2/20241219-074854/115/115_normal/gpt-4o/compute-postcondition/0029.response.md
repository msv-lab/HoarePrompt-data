The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are given as `1` and `2` respectively. Therefore, the new tuple being added is `(1 + 1, 2 + 1)`, which equates to `(2, 3)`.

The previously existing `operations` list contains two tuples: `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`. After executing the code, the new state of `operations` will be `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` contains tuples (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3); `B` is a 2D list of integers such that `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, `B[1][3] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[2][2] = 1`, `B[2][3] = 1`; `i` is 1; `j` is 2**.
