`operations` is a list of tuples, and the code appends a new tuple to it. The tuple consists of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The value of `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it remains unknown. However, `j` is equal to 1. Hence, the new tuple appended will be `(i + 1, 2)`, where `2` is the result of `j + 1`. The initial values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `B`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` includes (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i + 1, 2); `B` has elements `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][0]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` set to `1`; `j` is 1.**
