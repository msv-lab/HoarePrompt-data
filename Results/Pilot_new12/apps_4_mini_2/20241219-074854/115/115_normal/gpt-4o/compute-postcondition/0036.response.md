The statement appends a tuple to the `operations` list, with the first element being `i + 1` and the second element being `j + 1`. The value of `i` is equal to `n - 1` and `j` is currently 0. 

Since `i` equals `n - 1`, `i + 1` will simply equal `n`. Additionally, `j + 1` will be 1. Therefore, the tuple that gets appended is `(n, 1)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 0; B[n-1][0] = 1, B[n-1][1] = 1, B[n][0] = 1, B[n][1] = 1; operations now includes the tuple (n, 1).**
