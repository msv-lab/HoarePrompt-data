The value `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so `i + 1` will equal 1 and `j + 1` will equal 2. This tuple (1, 2) is then appended to the list `operations`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` includes (1, 1), (1, 2), `B` has elements updated to 1 in positions `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][0]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**
