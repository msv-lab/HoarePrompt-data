Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` includes (1, 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` with elements updated to 1 in positions `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]`; `i` is 0, `j` is 0 if `A[0][0]`, `A[0][1]`, `A[1][0]`, and `A[1][1]` are all 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
