According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `m` is at least 2, `m - 1` is at least 1. This means the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`. Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 1. 

To allow the loop to run one more time, `j` needs to be updated to 1 and `m` must be at least 2 so that `m - 1` remains at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1**
