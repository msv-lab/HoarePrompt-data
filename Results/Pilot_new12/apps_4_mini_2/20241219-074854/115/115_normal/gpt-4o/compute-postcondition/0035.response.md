The operation assigns the value of 1 to four specific elements in the array B based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is equal to `n - 1` and `j` is 0, we can identify the specific positions being updated in the array B: 

- `B[n-1][0] = 1`
- `B[n-1][1] = 1`
- `B[n][0] = 1`
- `B[n][1] = 1`

No other variables are affected by this operation; therefore, the output state should reflect the unchanged variables along with the information about the updated positions in B.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 0; B[n-1][0] = 1, B[n-1][1] = 1, B[n][0] = 1, B[n][1] = 1.**
