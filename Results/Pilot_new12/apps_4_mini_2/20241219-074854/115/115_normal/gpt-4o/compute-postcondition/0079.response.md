Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50. If the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are not equal, the function returns -1. Otherwise, since both elements are equal for all corresponding elements at row `i`, there is no additional effect from the else part of the code.***
