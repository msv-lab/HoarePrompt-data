Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`; `operations` contains a tuple (2, 1) and (2, 2); `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements all initialized to 0, except `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[1][2]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, `B[2][2]` = 1; `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. If `A[1][1]`, `A[1][2]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[2][2]` are all equal to 1, then `B` is modified accordingly; otherwise, `B` remains unchanged.***
