The code appends the tuple (i + 1, j + 1) to the list `operations`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `j` is also 0, the tuple that will be appended is (0 + 1, 0 + 1) which results in (1, 1). The other variables are not affected by this operation.

The output state shows that `operations` has now been updated to include the new value, while the other variables retain their previous values and characteristics.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `operations` includes (1, 1), `B` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m with elements updated to 1 in positions B[0][0], B[0][1], B[1][0], and B[1][1]; `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
