Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains a tuple (2, 1) indicating a found 2x2 block of 1s in `A`, and `B` remains a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, with `i` equal to 1 and `j` equal to 0. If the condition for the 2x2 block of 1s is satisfied, the tuple is added to `operations`. If the condition is not satisfied, `B` continues to have all elements as 0 and no tuples are added to `operations`.***
