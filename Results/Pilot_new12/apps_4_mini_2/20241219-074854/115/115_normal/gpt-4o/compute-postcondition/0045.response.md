Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is 2. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, then `B[n-1][2] = 1`, `B[n-1][3] = 1`, `B[n][2] = 1`, `B[n][3] = 1`, and the `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 3)`.***
