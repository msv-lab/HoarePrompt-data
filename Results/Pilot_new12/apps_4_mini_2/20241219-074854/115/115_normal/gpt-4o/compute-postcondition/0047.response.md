Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s in `A`; `B` contains 1s in positions corresponding to all found 2x2 blocks, otherwise `B` remains a 2D list of integers with elements all 0.**
