The variable `i` has a previous value of 1 and `j` has a previous value of 0. The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list, which evaluates to `(2, 1)`. The other variables such as `n`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains a tuple (2, 1), `B` remains a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0.**
