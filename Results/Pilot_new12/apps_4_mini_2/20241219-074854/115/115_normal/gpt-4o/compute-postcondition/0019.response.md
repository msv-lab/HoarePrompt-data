Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` will contain tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s, `B` will have 1s in positions corresponding to all found 2x2 blocks, otherwise `B` will remain a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, `i` is 1, `j` starts at 0, and the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.***
