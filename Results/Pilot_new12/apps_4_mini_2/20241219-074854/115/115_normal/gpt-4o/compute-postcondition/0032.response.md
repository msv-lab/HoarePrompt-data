According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Given that `i` is iterating from 0 to `n - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration where `i` reaches `n - 2`, in the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute again, the condition based on the range must hold, which means `n - 1` must be less than `n`, which is always true if `n` is at least 2. However, since the loop only executes for valid indices at `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must equal `n - 1` and the next iteration cannot occur because the range is exhausted.

Thus, the necessary states to adjust at the start of the next iteration would have `i` set to `n - 1`, and no change is needed for `A`, `B`, or `operations`, since the loop should not continue executing without finding any additional 2x2 blocks.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s in `A`; `B` contains 1s in positions corresponding to all found 2x2 blocks, otherwise `B` remains a 2D list of integers with elements all 0, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
