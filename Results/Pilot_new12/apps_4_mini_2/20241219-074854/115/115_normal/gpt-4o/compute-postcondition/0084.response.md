Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, indicating that all corresponding elements in `A` and `B` are equal. The loop has verified that for every position `(i, j)`, `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]`, confirming that both arrays are completely filled with zeros.**
