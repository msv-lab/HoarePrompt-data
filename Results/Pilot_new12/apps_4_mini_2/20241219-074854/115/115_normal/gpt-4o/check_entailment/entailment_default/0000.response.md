The program attempts to transform matrix `B`, initialized to all zeros, into matrix `A` using operations that can only fill 2x2 submatrices with 1s. The function checks for the presence of 2x2 blocks of 1s in matrix `A` and records the operations accordingly.

Output hints indicate that the function only identifies and processes cases where a complete 2x2 block of 1s is present in matrix `A`. However, the function misses to effectively address cases where:

1. Matrix `A` might have 1s outside of 2x2 blocks, leading to instances where matrix `B` cannot match matrix `A` accurately.
2. The function will consistently return -1 whenever it finds any mismatch between `A` and `B`, which fails to correctly identify when it is indeed impossible to create `A` from `B` using the allowed operations.

For example, if `A` contains isolated 1s or any 1 located in a position that cannot form a full 2x2 block, the program will incorrectly return -1 without further evaluating whether the arrangement can actually match.

In summary, the logic does not fully cover the possibilities in every scenario. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**.
