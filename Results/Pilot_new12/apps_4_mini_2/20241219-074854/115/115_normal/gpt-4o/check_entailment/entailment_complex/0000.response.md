The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of 2x2 Blocks**: 
   The program specifically checks for the presence of a complete 2x2 block of 1s in matrix `A` and marks it in matrix `B`. However, if there is a 1 that cannot be part of a 2x2 block (for example, a single 1 on its own or part of a larger structure but not in a complete 2x2 block), the program implicitly assumes this means the transformation is impossible and returns -1. This is incorrect based on the problem description because it is possible for `B` to be modified to match `A` without the presence of 2x2 blocks covering every single 1 in the entirety of `A`.

2. **Immediate Return on Mismatch**:
   After attempting to fill the `B` matrix, the program immediately checks for mismatches. It returns -1 if any element does not match. This approach fails to recognize that there might be portions of `A` that can still be made to match `B`, assuming there are other overlapping operations that could be performed.

3. **Output and Behavior on Non-2x2 Cases**:
   The code does not handle the scenario where `A` contains a mix of areas filled with 0s and 1s, where some of the 1s could potentially be covered with multiple 2x2 operations. If `A` has some isolated 1s that cannot be part of any 2x2 operation, the program incorrectly assumes it is an invalid configuration without exploring possible operations that could produce the desired result.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases. There are scenarios where it could falsely report that transformation to matrix `A` is impossible, when in fact it could be done through a proper sequence of allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
