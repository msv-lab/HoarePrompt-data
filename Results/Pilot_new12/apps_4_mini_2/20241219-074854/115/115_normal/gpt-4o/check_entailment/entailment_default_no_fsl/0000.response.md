Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where matrix `A` may contain isolated `1s` or `1s` that do not form a complete `2x2` block. If `A` contains any `1` that is not part of a `2x2` block, the program will incorrectly return `-1`, which indicates that it is impossible to achieve the desired transformation to matrix `B`. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

In this case, the `1s` in `A` do not form any `2x2` block, yet the program will return `-1`, indicating it is impossible to create matrix `A` from `B`, which is incorrect since the program must output `-1` for configurations that cannot be formed by adding `2x2` blocks. 

Moreover, the logic in the `func_1` function does not handle any case where there are no `2x2` blocks in `A`, leading it to always generate an incorrect response. 

Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the problem description for all potential inputs, thus confirming its incorrectness.
