Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the case where `1`s in matrix `A` are not formable into `2x2` blocks. It solely looks for `2x2` blocks in matrix `A` and sets corresponding positions in matrix `B`. If there are any `1`s in matrix `A` that are isolated or not part of a `2x2` block, the program will incorrectly return `-1`. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description since `B` may never match `A` in these scenarios. Therefore, the final assessment remains as stated: the program is incorrect.
