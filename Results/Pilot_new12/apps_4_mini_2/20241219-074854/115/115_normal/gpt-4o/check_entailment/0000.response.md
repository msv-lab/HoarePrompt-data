To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the main functionality of the program, particularly how it tries to replicate matrix A in matrix B using the allowed operations.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of matrix A (n x m) and initializes matrix A from input data.

2. **Matrix B Initialization**: Matrix B is initialized to zeroes.

3. **Operation Implementation**: The program iterates through a nested loop from `(0 to n-2)` and `(0 to m-2)`, checking if a `2x2` submatrix of A can be formed where all elements are `1`. If so, it marks that corresponding `2x2` submatrix in B as `1` and records the operation (the top-left coordinate of the `2x2` square).

4. **Final Check**: After all potential operations, it checks if matrices A and B are equal. If any discrepancy is found, it returns `-1`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Missing Operations**: The program does not account for cases where there may still be `1`s in A that could not be formed into a `2x2` block due to surrounding `0`s. For example, if matrix A looks like this:
  ```
  1 1
  0 0
  ```
  In this case, the program will not perform any operations, and matrix B will remain all `0`s. However, the correct answer should still indicate that it's impossible to replicate A because there is a `1` in A that cannot be matched.

- **Rows/Columns Boundary Condition**: If A has `1`s on edges without the potential to form a `2x2`, those `1`s would be ignored leading to an implicit `False` answer but might result in a return value of `-1` due to the final check.

### Example Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
2 3
1 1 0
1 1 0
```
In this case:
- The program would identify one possible operation to replace the first `2x2` submatrix in A. This would result in matrix B having some `1`s.
- However, the final element `(1, 3)` in A would still be `0` in B after this single operation and would result in an output of `-1`, even though matrix A is impossible to recreate from matrix B.

Hence, the program does not correctly handle scenarios where `1`s exist in positions not covered by any `2x2` operation.

### Conclusion:
Given this issue, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all possible input cases.

Correctness: **False**.
