You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step, focusing on the logic and potential edge cases.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input to obtain the dimensions of the matrices `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
   - It then constructs matrix `A` based on the input.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The main logic resides in `func_1`, where it initializes an empty matrix `B` filled with `0`s.
   - The program iterates through the elements of matrix `A` and checks for `2x2` submatrices filled with `1`s. If the current `2x2` area in `A` is all `1`s, the corresponding `2x2` area in `B` is set to `1`, and the operation is recorded.

3. **Final Comparison**:
   - The program then compares the resulting matrix `B` with matrix `A`. If they are not the same, it returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make the two matrices equal using the allowed operations.

### Potential Issues:
While the primary logic of identifying `2x2` blocks is present, there are critical edge cases not handled:

- The program only considers filling `B` based on the presence of `2x2` blocks of `1`s in `A`. However, if there are `1`s in positions not forming a `2x2` block (e.g., a single `1` or `1` in a vertical or horizontal line), `B` will never fully match the configuration of `A`. 

**Example Input for Failure Case**:
Consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

- In this case, the program processes `A` but will never be able to place `1`s in columns where there's a single `1` because the required `2x2` block can't be formed. The output should correctly be `-1`, but let's examine the program's flow.

1. The first iteration over `A` at `(0,0)` would fill its `B` matrix as:
```
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
- The program will then proceed to try and fill `B` using the specified logic, however, the final check reveals that the elements are not equal, leading to a return of `-1`.

This indeed shows the program handles certain edge cases correctly, but fails to address configurations that lack sufficient `2x2` blocks.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the situation where `1`s exist in `A` that cannot be matched in `B` due to the operation constraints. Therefore, it can be derived that there exists a case where the program will fail to provide the correct output.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and A is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, with dimensions n x m.
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `operations` contains tuples for each found 2x2 block of 1s in `A`; `B` contains 1s in positions corresponding to all found 2x2 blocks, otherwise `B` remains a 2D list of integers with elements all 0.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m`, indicating that all corresponding elements in `A` and `B` are equal. The loop has verified that for every position `(i, j)`, `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]`, confirming that both arrays are completely filled with zeros.
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where all elements are equal to 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with all elements equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, `operations` is defined and contains elements of variable length; all elements in `operations` are printed sequentially for each iteration, until the last element is reached, with the loop executed exactly `len(operations)` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers (either 0 or 1) with dimensions `n x m`, where `2 <= n, m <= 50`. It identifies all 2x2 blocks within `A` that are filled with 1s and logs their top-left coordinates in the `operations` list. After scanning through the input list `A`, the function creates a new list `B` to represent these blocks, marking their positions with 1s. It then compares `A` with `B`. If any element in `A` does not match the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1, indicating an inconsistency. Ultimately, the function only ever returns -1 regardless of the input, and it also prints the count of found 2x2 blocks of 1s and their coordinates, but these outputs do not influence the return value. Additionally, the implementation does not handle cases where `A` does not contain any 2x2 blocks or if it contains any 1s, as it every time returns -1 under the current logic.
