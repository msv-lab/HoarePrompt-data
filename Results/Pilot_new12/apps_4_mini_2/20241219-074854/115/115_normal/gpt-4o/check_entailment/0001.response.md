To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step, focusing on the logic and potential edge cases.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input to obtain the dimensions of the matrices `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
   - It then constructs matrix `A` based on the input.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The main logic resides in `func_1`, where it initializes an empty matrix `B` filled with `0`s.
   - The program iterates through the elements of matrix `A` and checks for `2x2` submatrices filled with `1`s. If the current `2x2` area in `A` is all `1`s, the corresponding `2x2` area in `B` is set to `1`, and the operation is recorded.

3. **Final Comparison**:
   - The program then compares the resulting matrix `B` with matrix `A`. If they are not the same, it returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make the two matrices equal using the allowed operations.

### Potential Issues:
While the primary logic of identifying `2x2` blocks is present, there are critical edge cases not handled:

- The program only considers filling `B` based on the presence of `2x2` blocks of `1`s in `A`. However, if there are `1`s in positions not forming a `2x2` block (e.g., a single `1` or `1` in a vertical or horizontal line), `B` will never fully match the configuration of `A`. 

**Example Input for Failure Case**:
Consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

- In this case, the program processes `A` but will never be able to place `1`s in columns where there's a single `1` because the required `2x2` block can't be formed. The output should correctly be `-1`, but let's examine the program's flow.

1. The first iteration over `A` at `(0,0)` would fill its `B` matrix as:
```
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
- The program will then proceed to try and fill `B` using the specified logic, however, the final check reveals that the elements are not equal, leading to a return of `-1`.

This indeed shows the program handles certain edge cases correctly, but fails to address configurations that lack sufficient `2x2` blocks.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the situation where `1`s exist in `A` that cannot be matched in `B` due to the operation constraints. Therefore, it can be derived that there exists a case where the program will fail to provide the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
