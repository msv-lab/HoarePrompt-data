You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the main functionality of the program, particularly how it tries to replicate matrix A in matrix B using the allowed operations.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of matrix A (n x m) and initializes matrix A from input data.

2. **Matrix B Initialization**: Matrix B is initialized to zeroes.

3. **Operation Implementation**: The program iterates through a nested loop from `(0 to n-2)` and `(0 to m-2)`, checking if a `2x2` submatrix of A can be formed where all elements are `1`. If so, it marks that corresponding `2x2` submatrix in B as `1` and records the operation (the top-left coordinate of the `2x2` square).

4. **Final Check**: After all potential operations, it checks if matrices A and B are equal. If any discrepancy is found, it returns `-1`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Missing Operations**: The program does not account for cases where there may still be `1`s in A that could not be formed into a `2x2` block due to surrounding `0`s. For example, if matrix A looks like this:
  ```
  1 1
  0 0
  ```
  In this case, the program will not perform any operations, and matrix B will remain all `0`s. However, the correct answer should still indicate that it's impossible to replicate A because there is a `1` in A that cannot be matched.

- **Rows/Columns Boundary Condition**: If A has `1`s on edges without the potential to form a `2x2`, those `1`s would be ignored leading to an implicit `False` answer but might result in a return value of `-1` due to the final check.

### Example Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
2 3
1 1 0
1 1 0
```
In this case:
- The program would identify one possible operation to replace the first `2x2` submatrix in A. This would result in matrix B having some `1`s.
- However, the final element `(1, 3)` in A would still be `0` in B after this single operation and would result in an output of `-1`, even though matrix A is impossible to recreate from matrix B.

Hence, the program does not correctly handle scenarios where `1`s exist in positions not covered by any `2x2` operation.

### Conclusion:
Given this issue, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all possible input cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: two integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers (either 0 or 1) with dimensions `n x m`, where `2 <= n, m <= 50`. It identifies all 2x2 blocks within `A` that are filled with 1s and logs their top-left coordinates in the `operations` list. After scanning through the input list `A`, the function creates a new list `B` to represent these blocks, marking their positions with 1s. It then compares `A` with `B`. If any element in `A` does not match the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1, indicating an inconsistency. Ultimately, the function only ever returns -1 regardless of the input, and it also prints the count of found 2x2 blocks of 1s and their coordinates, but these outputs do not influence the return value. Additionally, the implementation does not handle cases where `A` does not contain any 2x2 blocks or if it contains any 1s, as it every time returns -1 under the current logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
