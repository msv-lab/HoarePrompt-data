Correctness: **False**

The given program does not completely fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Explanation:

1. **Operation Limitation**: The program attempts to identify every possible `2x2` block of `1`s in matrix `A` and sets the corresponding values in matrix `B` to `1`. However, it does not ensure that every `1` in `A` can be covered by these `2x2` operations. Specifically, there can be configurations in which certain `1`s cannot be part of any `2x2` submatrix. For example, if you have a `1` isolated by `0`s, the program will simply ignore it and will output `B` such that it does not cover that `1`, leading to an incorrect result.

2. **Output Check**: Under the condition that `A` has any `1` element that cannot be transformed into `B` through the allowed `2x2` operations, the program does not correctly return `-1`. Instead, it will always print `0` if no operations were needed (meaning `B` is still filled with all `0`s), which would be true even if `A` had `1`s that cannot be transformed into `B`.

3. **Failure to Print -1 When Necessary**: The program includes an attempt to compare `A` and `B` after filling `B` based on detected `2x2` blocks. If, after this population, there are elements in `A` that are `1` but directly corresponding elements in `B` are still `0`, the program never reaches a point where it outputs `-1`. It outputs the length of operations and their coordinates without proper evaluation if all required units in `A` have been matched.

### Conclusion:
Due to these flaws, the program may not be able to correctly determine when it is impossible to make the two matrices equal. Thus, it fails to follow the complete problem description, leading to a conclusion of correctness being **False**.
