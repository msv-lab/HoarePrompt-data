The function accepts two integers, n and m, representing the dimensions of a 2D list A, and reads this list from input. It initializes a list called ops to store coordinates where certain conditions regarding the adjacent elements of A are met. Specifically, for all pairs of adjacent 2x2 submatrices within A, if at least one of the four corners contains a 1, the coordinates of the bottom-right corner (i + 1, j + 1) are added to ops. After iterating through the potential submatrices, if ops contains more than 2500 entries, the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the length of ops and then each coordinate stored in ops. Thus, the function either indicates a failure condition (when ops is too long) or provides information on the positions of the found conditions, while the state of A remains unchanged throughout. In case no valid positions are found, ops will be empty and the function will print 0. The function also doesn't handle any incorrect input scenarios or edge cases related to invalid dimensions or non-integer values.
