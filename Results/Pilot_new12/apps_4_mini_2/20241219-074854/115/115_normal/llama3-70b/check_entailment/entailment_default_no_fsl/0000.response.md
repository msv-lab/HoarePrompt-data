Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether matrix B can be made equal to matrix A for every potential case. The main issue arises in the way it identifies when to perform operations on matrix B.

1. **Problem Misinterpretation**: The program only checks if at least one of the four corners of a 2x2 submatrix is 1, and if so, it appends the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of that submatrix to the operations list `ops`. This is incorrect. The requirement is to operate on 2x2 submatrices only when all four elements of A (i.e., A[i][j], A[i][j + 1], A[i + 1][j], A[i + 1][j + 1]) are 1. If there are any 0s in these positions, it should not apply any operation.

2. **Incapability of Certain Cases**: The logic fails to ensure that all 1s in matrix A can actually be matched and transformed from matrix B. For example, if you have the following matrix A:
   ```
   1 0
   1 0
   ```
   In this case, it is impossible for matrix B to be equal to matrix A, as there are isolated 1s which cannot form a complete 2x2 submatrix for an operation. However, the existing code may not capture this case properly, meaning it could falsely suggest that matrix B can still be manipulated to equal matrix A when it actually cannot.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly manage scenarios where the non-1 configurations exist. For example, if there's any 0 in the 2x2 requirements, the program does not backtrack or check if other operations are needed to fill gaps, hence failing to ensure the correctness of the final output.

Therefore, because the program does not correctly handle various input cases, specifically the defined conditions for when operations should be applied (i.e., all four corners are 1) and fails in several edge cases, it is deemed incorrect.
