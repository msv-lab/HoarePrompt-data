The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if matrix `B` can be transformed into matrix `A` using the specified operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Understanding the Logic for Operations**:
   - The goal is to find all possible 2x2 submatrices in `A` that can be turned into `1s` in `B`. 
   - The program checks if all four corners of a 2x2 submatrix in `A` are `1`. If they are, it correctly identifies that this submatrix can be turned into `1s` in `B`. However, it doesn't record that operation in `ops`.
   - Conversely, if any corner of a 2x2 submatrix is `1`, it appends the `(i + 1, j + 1)` coordinate to `ops`, which is incorrect when considering the operations needed. This mistakenly includes positions where at least one corner is `1`, instead of being part of an actual submatrix that can be turned into `1s`.

2. **Missing Check for Apart from Corners**:
   - The logic doesn't ensure that the operation is valid. Just because a certain position has `1`, it doesn't mean that this will lead to a valid transition of `B` from all zeros to match `A`.

3. **Outcome Not Guaranteed**:
   - The program does not verify at the end that all entries in `A` can indeed be matched by `B` after performing operations. It merely counts operations based on the above heuristic, which could lead to a situation where the printed results do not indeed allow `B` to match `A`.

4. **Example of Failure**:
   - Suppose `A` contains `1` in various configurations that require specific coordinated operations. The program may erroneously allow operations to be recorded without actually being able to perform operations to match `A` completely.

5. **Inadequate Handling**:
   - When it finds operations that could lead to `B`, there is no verification step afterward that double-checks if after performing these operations, `B` indeed equals `A`.

In conclusion, the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. It does not consider the need to ensure that `B` can be fully transformed into `A` nor does it properly gather the operations as needed.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
