You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and check whether it correctly handles all possible input scenarios as described in the problem.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. The program starts by reading the dimensions of the matrices (n, m) and then matrix A.
2. It initializes an empty list `ops` to record the operations performed.
3. The nested loops iterate over every possible top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in matrix A.
4. Inside the nested loops:
   - It checks if a 2x2 block of 1s is present at the current position. If it is, it does nothing.
   - If any of the elements in the 2x2 block are 1s but not the entire block, it records the operation to turn that 2x2 block to 1s in matrix B.
5. After identifying potential operations, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If it does, it outputs `-1`.
6. Finally, it prints the number of operations and their corresponding coordinates.

### Potential Issues and Edge Cases:

To check for correctness, we need to identify if there's any situation where the transformation from B to A is impossible due to the way the program is designed. 

#### Test Case:

Consider the following scenario where transformation is not possible:

Input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```

- Matrix A looks like:
```
1 1
1 0
```

- Following the program's logic:
  - The program will first check the 0-based indices for the top-left 2x2 submatrix located at (0,0), which is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 0
    ```
  - Since (0,0) has at least one `1` and at least one `0`, it will append the operation `(1, 1)` (which translates to setting the 2x2 starting at 1, 1 in 1-based indexing).
  - However, performing the operation `(1, 1)` would alter:
    ```
    B[1,1] = 1
    B[1,2] = 1
    B[2,1] = 1
    B[2,2] = 1
    ```
    But the initial part of B remains cleared (as it's initialized to 0) and once we perform these operations, B becomes:
    ```
    1 1
    1 1
    ```
  - This does not equal A, thus making it impossible to achieve the desired outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to recognize that there are configurations in matrix A (like the one provided) where it is impossible to perform the operations and make B equal A, especially when there are isolated 1s without a surrounding complete 2x2 block of 1s.

Hence the statement of correctness for the given Python program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and A is a 2D list of integers containing exactly n rows and m columns where each element is either 0 or 1. Matrix B is initialized to a 2D list of zeros with the same dimensions as A.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` contains tuples with coordinates of all cells (i + 1, j + 1) where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1 for all valid pairs of (i, j) examined in the loops. If no such cells are found, `ops` remains empty.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` is a list with up to 2500 entries; all entries in `ops` have been printed. If `ops` is empty, the loop does not execute and the state of `ops` is an empty list.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `B` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions n x m, `n` is at least 2, and `m` is between 2 and 50. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ops` contains up to 2500 entries, all of which have been printed. If `ops` is empty, no entries are printed and `ops` remains an empty list.
