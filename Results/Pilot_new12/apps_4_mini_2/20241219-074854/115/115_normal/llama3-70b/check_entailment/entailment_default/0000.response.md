The code does not fulfill the problem description in every potential case. The output hints indicate that the function iterates through pairs of adjacent 2x2 submatrices to check whether at least one corner contains a 1, and if so, it adds those coordinates to the `ops` list. However, it does not ensure that all needed operations are executed to transform matrix B into matrix A correctly.

For instance, if only some of the corners of a 2x2 submatrix contain a 1 but not all of them, the code does not attempt to perform the necessary operations to fill in the remaining positions with 1s. This can lead to scenarios where the matrix B cannot be transformed into matrix A correctly, leading to a situation where the output can be incorrect.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 1
```
According to the problem, we should be able to turn a matrix B (all zeros initially) into A. The code would identify (1, 1) and (1, 2) as valid operations but would not capture the need to perform additional operations that may be necessary to fill the 0s appropriately. Hence, it might end up not making B equal to A and would output a list of operations that does not actually solve the problem completely.

Since there exists a case leading to an incorrect transformation from B to A based on the conditions set in the code, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
