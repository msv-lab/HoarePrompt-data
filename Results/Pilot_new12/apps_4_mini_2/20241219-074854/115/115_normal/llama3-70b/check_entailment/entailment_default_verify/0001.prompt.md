You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and check whether it correctly handles all possible input scenarios as described in the problem.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. The program starts by reading the dimensions of the matrices (n, m) and then matrix A.
2. It initializes an empty list `ops` to record the operations performed.
3. The nested loops iterate over every possible top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in matrix A.
4. Inside the nested loops:
   - It checks if a 2x2 block of 1s is present at the current position. If it is, it does nothing.
   - If any of the elements in the 2x2 block are 1s but not the entire block, it records the operation to turn that 2x2 block to 1s in matrix B.
5. After identifying potential operations, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If it does, it outputs `-1`.
6. Finally, it prints the number of operations and their corresponding coordinates.

### Potential Issues and Edge Cases:

To check for correctness, we need to identify if there's any situation where the transformation from B to A is impossible due to the way the program is designed. 

#### Test Case:

Consider the following scenario where transformation is not possible:

Input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```

- Matrix A looks like:
```
1 1
1 0
```

- Following the program's logic:
  - The program will first check the 0-based indices for the top-left 2x2 submatrix located at (0,0), which is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 0
    ```
  - Since (0,0) has at least one `1` and at least one `0`, it will append the operation `(1, 1)` (which translates to setting the 2x2 starting at 1, 1 in 1-based indexing).
  - However, performing the operation `(1, 1)` would alter:
    ```
    B[1,1] = 1
    B[1,2] = 1
    B[2,1] = 1
    B[2,2] = 1
    ```
    But the initial part of B remains cleared (as it's initialized to 0) and once we perform these operations, B becomes:
    ```
    1 1
    1 1
    ```
  - This does not equal A, thus making it impossible to achieve the desired outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to recognize that there are configurations in matrix A (like the one provided) where it is impossible to perform the operations and make B equal A, especially when there are isolated 1s without a surrounding complete 2x2 block of 1s.

Hence the statement of correctness for the given Python program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers, n and m, representing the dimensions of a 2D list A, and reads this list from input. It initializes a list called ops to store coordinates where certain conditions regarding the adjacent elements of A are met. Specifically, for all pairs of adjacent 2x2 submatrices within A, if at least one of the four corners contains a 1, the coordinates of the bottom-right corner (i + 1, j + 1) are added to ops. After iterating through the potential submatrices, if ops contains more than 2500 entries, the function prints -1; otherwise, it prints the length of ops and then each coordinate stored in ops. Thus, the function either indicates a failure condition (when ops is too long) or provides information on the positions of the found conditions, while the state of A remains unchanged throughout. In case no valid positions are found, ops will be empty and the function will print 0. The function also doesn't handle any incorrect input scenarios or edge cases related to invalid dimensions or non-integer values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
