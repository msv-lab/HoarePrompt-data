To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and check whether it correctly handles all possible input scenarios as described in the problem.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. The program starts by reading the dimensions of the matrices (n, m) and then matrix A.
2. It initializes an empty list `ops` to record the operations performed.
3. The nested loops iterate over every possible top-left corner of a 2x2 submatrix in matrix A.
4. Inside the nested loops:
   - It checks if a 2x2 block of 1s is present at the current position. If it is, it does nothing.
   - If any of the elements in the 2x2 block are 1s but not the entire block, it records the operation to turn that 2x2 block to 1s in matrix B.
5. After identifying potential operations, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500. If it does, it outputs `-1`.
6. Finally, it prints the number of operations and their corresponding coordinates.

### Potential Issues and Edge Cases:

To check for correctness, we need to identify if there's any situation where the transformation from B to A is impossible due to the way the program is designed. 

#### Test Case:

Consider the following scenario where transformation is not possible:

Input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```

- Matrix A looks like:
```
1 1
1 0
```

- Following the program's logic:
  - The program will first check the 0-based indices for the top-left 2x2 submatrix located at (0,0), which is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 0
    ```
  - Since (0,0) has at least one `1` and at least one `0`, it will append the operation `(1, 1)` (which translates to setting the 2x2 starting at 1, 1 in 1-based indexing).
  - However, performing the operation `(1, 1)` would alter:
    ```
    B[1,1] = 1
    B[1,2] = 1
    B[2,1] = 1
    B[2,2] = 1
    ```
    But the initial part of B remains cleared (as it's initialized to 0) and once we perform these operations, B becomes:
    ```
    1 1
    1 1
    ```
  - This does not equal A, thus making it impossible to achieve the desired outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to recognize that there are configurations in matrix A (like the one provided) where it is impossible to perform the operations and make B equal A, especially when there are isolated 1s without a surrounding complete 2x2 block of 1s.

Hence the statement of correctness for the given Python program is:

Correctness: **False**
