Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Operations Logic Flaw**: The program attempts to identify positions `(i, j)` in matrix `A` where at least one of the four corners of a potential `2x2` submatrix equals `1`, and then it records the operation to set that submatrix in `B` at the corresponding position. However, it does not ensure that these positions actually correspond to valid operations that would result in matrix `B` being equal to matrix `A`. For a `2x2` submatrix of `A` to be made equal to `1` in `B`, all four elements in that submatrix must be `1`. The program currently only checks if at least one of the positions has a `1`, which leads to possible attempts to set `B` at positions where it is impossible to achieve the desired result.

2. **Output for Impossible Cases**: The logic does not properly detect and handle cases where making `B` equal to `A` is impossible. For example, if `A` has isolated `1`s that cannot form a complete `2x2` submatrix, those cases would not be correctly identified and should return `-1`, according to the problem description.

3. **Incomplete Coverage**: The program does not utilize the operations correctly when elements of `A` set the condition for setting elements in `B`. It should be checking if it can indeed perform the operation at specific points to construct `A` completely.

Thus, the program fails to correctly implement the outlined operations and checks necessary to make `B` equal `A` in every possible scenario indicated in the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs for some inputs.
