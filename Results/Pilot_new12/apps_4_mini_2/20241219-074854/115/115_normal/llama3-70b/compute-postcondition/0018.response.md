Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then the nearest enclosing loop continues without any changes.***
