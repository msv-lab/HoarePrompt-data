The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. As there are no changes to any variable values or assignments in this case, the previous state remains valid. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 3 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).**
