The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceeds with the next iteration of that loop. Since thereâ€™s no indication of what loop `continue` is associated with and no variables have been modified, the impact is that we simply skip to the next iteration.

The values of the variables remain unchanged:

- `A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1.
- `B` is a 2D list of zeros.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `m` is between 2 and 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 1.
- `ops` includes the tuple (3, 1).

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros; `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `ops` now includes the tuple (3, 1), and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
