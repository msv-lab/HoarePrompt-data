The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since we don't have any specific loop context here or details on whether we were inside a loop, we will assume that the `continue` does not change any values of the variables or states outside of a loop.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros; `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; and `ops` includes the tuples (3, 1), (3, 2).**
