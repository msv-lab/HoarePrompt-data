Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1). If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
