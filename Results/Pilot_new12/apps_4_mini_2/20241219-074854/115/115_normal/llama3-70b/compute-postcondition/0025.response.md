The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. However, since there are no visible loops or iterations in the provided code context, the effect of `continue` here is effectively a no-op in relation to variable updates. Therefore, no variables are changed.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1), `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
