Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, if any of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, the tuple (1, 3) is added to `ops`; otherwise, there are no changes made to `ops` since there is no else part in the code.***
