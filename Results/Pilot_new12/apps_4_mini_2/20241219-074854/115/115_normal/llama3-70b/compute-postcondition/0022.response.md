According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 0, and considering that `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Since the loop runs while `i` is less than `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (since 1 must be less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is m - 2, `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1) if cells meet the condition.**
