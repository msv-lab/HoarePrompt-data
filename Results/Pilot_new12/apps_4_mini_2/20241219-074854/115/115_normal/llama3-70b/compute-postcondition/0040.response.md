Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is m - 2, and `ops` contains the coordinates of all valid (2, j + 1) where any of the values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1. If none of those elements are equal to 1 for any `j`, then `ops` remains unchanged and contains only the coordinates (1, m - 1). The values in `B` remain unchanged as a list of zeros throughout the iterations.**
