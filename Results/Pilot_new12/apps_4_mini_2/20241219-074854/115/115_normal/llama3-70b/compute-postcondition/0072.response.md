Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m, `B` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions n x m, `n` is at least 2, and `m` is between 2 and 50. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ops` contains up to 2500 entries, all of which have been printed. If `ops` is empty, no entries are printed and `ops` remains an empty list.***
