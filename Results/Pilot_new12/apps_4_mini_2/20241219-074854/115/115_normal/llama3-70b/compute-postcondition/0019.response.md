The `ops` list is being modified by appending a new tuple to it. The values `i` and `j` are both defined, where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Therefore, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` equates to `(1, 3)`. 

The state of `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged as the only change is the addition to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `ops` is updated to include the tuple (1, 3).**
