The variables `n` and `m` are being assigned new values based on user input. The values must respect the constraint that `2 <= n, m <= 50`. The 2D list `A` remains unchanged, and the 2D list `B` remains a matrix of zeros. The exact new values of `n` and `m` are unknown as they are based on input. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `n` and `m` are now the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers with n rows and m columns containing either 0 or 1, `B` is initialized to a 2D list of zeros with dimensions n x m; `n` and `m` are integers entered by the user such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50.**
