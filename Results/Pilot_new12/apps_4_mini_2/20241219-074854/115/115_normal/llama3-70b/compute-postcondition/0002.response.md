The code initializes `ops` as an empty list. The variable `ops` is now defined but does not contain any values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as the code does not affect `A`, `B`, `n`, or `m`. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns containing either 0 or 1 based on user input; `B` is initialized to a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `n` x `m`; `n` and `m` are integers entered by the user such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50; `ops` is an empty list.**
