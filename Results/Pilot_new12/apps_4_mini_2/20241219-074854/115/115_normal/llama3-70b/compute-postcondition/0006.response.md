The `continue` statement does not change any variable's values or the overall structure of the program. Instead, it causes the current iteration of the loop to terminate, moving to the next iteration, but no state changes are observed for the provided variables.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the elements A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], and A[1][1] are all equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
