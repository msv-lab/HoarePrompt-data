Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is still 0, `j` is  m - 2. The list `ops` contains the coordinates (i + 1, j + 1) for each cell (i, j) where any of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, after examining all columns from j = 0 to j = m - 2. If no cells meet the condition for only one pair of j values, ops remain unchanged.**
