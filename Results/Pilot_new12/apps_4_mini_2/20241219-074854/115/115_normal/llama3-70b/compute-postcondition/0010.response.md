Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If any of the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, the tuple (1, 1) is added to `ops`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
