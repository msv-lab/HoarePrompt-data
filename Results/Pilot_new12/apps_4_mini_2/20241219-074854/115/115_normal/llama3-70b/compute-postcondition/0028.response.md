The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0

We can calculate the new values:
- `i + 1` equals `2`
- `j + 1` equals `1`

Now, the list `ops` will have the new coordinate `(2, 1)` added to it.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1) and (2, 1)**.
