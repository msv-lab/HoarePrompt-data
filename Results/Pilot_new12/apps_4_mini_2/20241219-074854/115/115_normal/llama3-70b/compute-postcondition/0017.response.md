The statement `continue` is intended to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. In this case, since there are no updates to the values of the variables `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, `i`, or `j`, the overall state remains unchanged apart from potentially affecting the flow of loop iterations.

The state of `i` and `j` remains the same, and the program continues execution, moving to the next iteration of the loop if one exists. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 and the nearest enclosing loop continues without any changes.**
