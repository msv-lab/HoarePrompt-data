Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

Initial State: `A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. 

The condition checks if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1. If they are, the loop skips the iteration, and the line `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` would not execute. If at least one of them is not equal to 1, `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` will append the tuple `(1, 2)` (since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1).

Assuming that at least one value among the four specified (`A[0][1], A[1][1], A[0][2], A[1][2]`) is not equal to 1, the operations will be executed successfully, resulting in appending `(1, 2)` to the list `ops`.

Since `ops` is mentioned in the output state but its initial state is not provided, I will assume it was an empty list or already defined and will simply reflect that an operation has taken place.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ops` has appended the value (1, 2)**
