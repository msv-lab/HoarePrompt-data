Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `j` is m - 1, and `ops` includes tuples (3, 1), (3, 2), ..., and (3, m) for each `j` where at least one of `A[2][j]`, `A[3][j]`, `A[2][j + 1]`, or `A[3][j + 1]` equals 1. If none of these conditions are satisfied in all iterations, `ops` remains unchanged and includes only tuples collected when at least one of the conditions were true throughout the loop.**
