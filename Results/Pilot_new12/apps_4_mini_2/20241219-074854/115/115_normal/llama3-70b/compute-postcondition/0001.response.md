The code assigns a new value to the variable `A`, which is created as a 2D list of integers. The values of the elements in `A` are obtained from user input; each row consists of integers either `0` or `1`. The dimensions of `A` are determined by the previously defined values of `n` and `m`. The structure of `B` remains unchanged as it is still initialized to a 2D list of zeros with the same dimensions.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers with n rows and m columns containing either 0 or 1 based on user input; `B` is initialized to a 2D list of zeros with dimensions n x m; `n` and `m` are integers entered by the user such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50.**
