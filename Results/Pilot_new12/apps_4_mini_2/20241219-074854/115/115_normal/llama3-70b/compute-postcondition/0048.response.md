Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m) with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m); `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; and `ops` now includes the tuple (3, 1). If any of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, the tuple (3, 1) is added to `ops`.***
