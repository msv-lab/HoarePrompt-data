The code snippet provided prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. The content of `ops` is not modified by the code, and we do not know the specific values stored in `op[0]` and `op[1]`, but we know that `ops` contains at least 2 entries. 

The output reflects the printed values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. The other variables maintain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` must have at least 2 entries; `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed values obtained from the `ops` list.**
