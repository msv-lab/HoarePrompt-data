The `print(op[0], op[1])` statement accesses the first two elements of the list `op`. As per the initial state, we have `ops` with at least one entry, so `op[0]` and `op[1]` will reference valid values from this list. 

Since `A` is a 2D list of integers and `B` is also a 2D list of zeros, their states are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and additionally specify that the first two elements of `ops` are printed.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` must have at least 1 entry, and `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed.**
