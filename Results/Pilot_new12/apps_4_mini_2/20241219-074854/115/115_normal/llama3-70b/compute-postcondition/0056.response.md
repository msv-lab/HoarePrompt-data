Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros; `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; and `ops` includes the tuples (3, 1), (3, 2) when `A[i][j]` and `A[i + 1][j]` both equal 1, and `A[i][j + 1]` and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are also 1. If the condition is not satisfied, the values of `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain unchanged.***
