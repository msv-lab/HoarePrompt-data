The statement `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 in the initial state, the resulting tuple will be `(1, 1)`. Other variables are not changed.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all variables and indicates the new tuple added to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `ops` now contains the tuple (1, 1).**
