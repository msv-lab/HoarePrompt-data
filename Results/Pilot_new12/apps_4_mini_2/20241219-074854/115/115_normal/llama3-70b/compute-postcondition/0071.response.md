Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` is a list with up to 2500 entries; all entries in `ops` have been printed. If `ops` is empty, the loop does not execute and the state of `ops` is an empty list.**
