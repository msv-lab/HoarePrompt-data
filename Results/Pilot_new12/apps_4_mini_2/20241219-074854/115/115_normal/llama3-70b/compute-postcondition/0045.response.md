Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` remains unchanged. If `A[2][0]` is 1, `A[3][0]` is 1, `A[2][1]` is 1, and `A[3][1]` is 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
