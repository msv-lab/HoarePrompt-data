Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The elements A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], and A[1][1] are all equal to 1. At least one of the following conditions is true: A[i][j] is 1, or A[i + 1][j] is 1, or A[i][j + 1] is 1, or A[i + 1][j + 1] is 1.***
