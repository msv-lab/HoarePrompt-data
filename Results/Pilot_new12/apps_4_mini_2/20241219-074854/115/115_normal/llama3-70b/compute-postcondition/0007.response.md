Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If the elements A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], and A[1][1] are all equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
