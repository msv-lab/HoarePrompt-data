According to the code, the loop iterates over the `ops` list. For another iteration of the loop to happen, the list must have at least one more entry than the current position in the iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` must have had at least 2 entries, and `op[0]` and `op[1]` were printed. Thus, if `op` is the last element processed in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must have at least 3 entries, and the next `op` will be `op[2]` (the third entry in the list).

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` must have at least 3 entries; `op` is the third entry in the `ops` list.**
