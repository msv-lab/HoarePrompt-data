Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 3 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1), (2, 1), (2, 2). If any of the values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equal 1, then `ops` now also contains (2, 3).***
