The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes to the variables in this case (the code does not affect any assignments or calculations), the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` remains unchanged. The current value of `A[2][0]` is 1, `A[3][0]` is 1, `A[2][1]` is 1, and `A[3][1]` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
