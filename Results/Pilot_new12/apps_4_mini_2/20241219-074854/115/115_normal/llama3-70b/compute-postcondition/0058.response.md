Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros; `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; and if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `ops` includes the tuples (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3). If none of these conditions are satisfied, the values of `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain unchanged.***
