The function `func` accepts parameters `n` and `m`, which are integers such that `2 <= n, m <= 50`. It also accepts a parameter `A`, which is a 2D list of integers containing exactly `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1. The function initializes a 2D list `B` of zeros with the same dimensions as `A`. After executing the function body, the function processes the input matrix `A` and produces the output matrix `B`. The exact transformations or conditions applied to elements of `A` to populate `B` are not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `n` and `m`, a 2D list `A`, and create a corresponding 2D list `B` initialized with zeros, based on the dimensions derived from `A`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and m, and a 2D list A. It initializes a 2D list B of zeros with dimensions n by m.**
