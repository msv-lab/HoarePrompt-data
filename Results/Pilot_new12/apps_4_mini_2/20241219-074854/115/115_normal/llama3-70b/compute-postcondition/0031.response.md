The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. However, the state of the variables remains unaffected as no assignments were made, and we do not exit any loops. 

Given that `i` and `j` were initialized as 1, and we have `ops` with specific coordinates, we simply continue to the next iteration with the same values for `i` and `j`. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1) and (2, 1).**
