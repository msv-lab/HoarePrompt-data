Since the initial state specifies that `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1) and (2, 1), the operation `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` will add the tuple `(2, 2)` to the list `ops`. The other variables remain unchanged, as there are no operations performed on `A` or `B` in the provided code snippet. 

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).**
