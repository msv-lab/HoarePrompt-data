Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `ops` contains tuples with coordinates of all cells (i + 1, j + 1) where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1 for all valid pairs of (i, j) examined in the loops. The length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500.***
