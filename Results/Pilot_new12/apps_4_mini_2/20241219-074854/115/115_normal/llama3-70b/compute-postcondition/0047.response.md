The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, the values are calculated as follows: `i + 1` equals 3, and `j + 1` equals 1. Therefore, the tuple `(3, 1)` will be added to `ops`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m) and contains `A[2][0]` is 1, `A[3][0]` is 1, `A[2][1]` is 1, `A[3][1]` is 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m); `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `ops` now includes the tuple (3, 1).**
