According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, meaning the loop has executed for the values `j = 0` and `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. The loop can continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`, which means `m` must be greater than 3 for the next iteration to be valid (since `j` will be 2).

Therefore, the adjusted state needs to reflect that `j` will now be 2 and `m` must be greater than 3 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 3, `m` is between 3 and 50, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` contains the coordinates (1, m - 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).**
