Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros; `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; and `ops` now includes the tuple (3, 1). If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` holds true, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
