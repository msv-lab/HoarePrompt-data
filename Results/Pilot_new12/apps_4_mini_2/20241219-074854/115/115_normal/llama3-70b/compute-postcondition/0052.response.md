Given the initial state and the code execution, we can deduce the following:

The current values are:
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1.
- `B` is a 2D list of zeros.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `m` is between 2 and 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 1.
- `ops` now includes the tuple (3, 1).

The condition checks if:
- `A[i][j] == 1` (which is `A[2][1] == 1`)
- `A[i + 1][j] == 1` (which is `A[3][1] == 1`)
- `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`. Both of these would typically refer to `A[2][2]` and `A[3][2]`, but we do not have this information in the initial state.

Assuming the tuples from `ops` are only added if the condition is true, and since `A[2][1]` and `A[3][1]` are indeed 1 but we lack information on `A[2][2]` and `A[3][2]`, we cannot definitively say the state remains unchanged or if `ops` would be affected.

Yet, based on the given conditions and `i`, `j` values:
- Since `A[i][j]` and `A[i + 1][j]` are true (both are 1), but we can't ascertain the values for `A[i][j + 1]` and `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, we assume the condition that could allow a true continuation isn't fulfilled as two parts are unknown. 

Thus we proceed to append to `ops`:
- `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` translates to `ops.append((3, 2))`.

The output will reflect the new state of `ops`.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers with specific values where `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1; `B` is a 2D list of zeros; `n` is at least 3; `m` is between 2 and 50; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `ops` now includes the tuples (3, 1) and (3, 2).**
