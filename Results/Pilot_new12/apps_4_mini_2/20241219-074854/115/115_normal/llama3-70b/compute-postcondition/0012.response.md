The code `continue` does not alter any variables or state, but it indicates that the current iteration of the loop is to be skipped, and the next iteration will be continued. Since the values of `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, the Output State is simply a reflection of this.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (dimensions n x m), `B` is a 2D list of zeros (dimensions n x m), `n` is at least 2, `m` is between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
