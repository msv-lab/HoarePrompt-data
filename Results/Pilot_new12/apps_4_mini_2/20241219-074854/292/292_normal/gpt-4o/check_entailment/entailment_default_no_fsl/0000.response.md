Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It simulates the yearly growth of Limak and Bob's weights, where Limak's weight triples each year and Bob's weight doubles. The program uses a loop that continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, and it correctly counts and prints the number of years required for this condition to be met.

The output hints also accurately describe the behavior of the function. For every potential case detailed in the problem description, including the case where Limak starts with the same weight as Bob (1 1), the program correctly performs the calculations and outputs the expected results. 

Since the program adheres to the specifications of the problem for all valid input cases within the constraints, it can be concluded that the program meets the requirements correctly.
