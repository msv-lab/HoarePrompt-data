The given program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's an explanation of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The constraints `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10` are guaranteed, so it starts with valid inputs.

2. **Weight Growth Simulation**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
   - Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`), simulating the annual weight growth correctly.

3. **Year Counter**:
   - The variable `years` is incremented in each iteration of the loop. This correctly counts how many years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

4. **Exit Condition**:
   - The loop completes when `a > b`, ensuring that Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's, as required by the problem statement.

5. **Output**:
   - The final count of `years` is printed, representing the number of years after which Limak becomes strictly heavier than Bob.

**Correctness**:
- The program runs for a limited number of iterations (maximum of a few years, given the growth rates and the input limits), making it efficient for the constraints provided.
- It adheres strictly to the prompt and handles all stipulated cases, including when Limak and Bob start at the same weight. In this case, the loop will still execute at least once and will ultimately yield a correct output.

Thus, based on the reasoning above, the program correctly fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
