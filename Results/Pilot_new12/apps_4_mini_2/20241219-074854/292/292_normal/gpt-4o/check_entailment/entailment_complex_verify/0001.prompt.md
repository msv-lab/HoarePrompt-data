You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for the scenario where Limak and Bob start with the same weight. According to the problem description, if Limak's weight is equal to Bob's weight at the beginning, Limak should become larger than Bob after one year. In the code implementation, when the input is `1 1`, it enters the loop and multiplies both weights, resulting in `3` for Limak and `2` for Bob, leading to a count of `1` year, which is correct here. However, for the cases where their initial weights are equal but other than `1`, for example, `2 2`, `3 3`, ..., it will incorrectly assume that Limak has not become strictly larger until the calculation advances. The program would incorrectly return an indefinite "years" count unless considering equal conditions at input. 

Additionally, as Limak's weight is restricted to being never greater than Bob's weight at the start, the logic correctly handles the condition but fails to differentiate when they start equivalent. 

This inconsistency means that the program cannot handle all potential cases effectively, thus yielding a false correctness judgment on its overall operation. 

For example, for input `2 2`, the loop would go on indefinitely leading to incorrect results, as Limak would take 1 year to surpass but the code wouldn't count correctly due to the while condition.

Thus, the program is faulty in its robustness against initial equal weights leading to incorrect outputs in at least those circumstances.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, where a is Limak's weight and b is Bob's weight.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        
        b *= 2
        
        years += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is greater than `b`, `b` is equal to `2^(years) * original_value_of_b`, `a` is equal to `3^(years) * original_value_of_a`, and `years` is the total iterations executed.
    print(years)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, a and b, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It simulates a growth cycle where Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles in each iteration of a loop, continuing until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The function counts the number of iterations (years) it takes for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight. After the function concludes, it outputs the total count of years required for Limak to become heavier than Bob. In cases where Limak starts with the same weight as Bob, the loop will execute at least once. The function does not handle any input validation for weights outside the specified range or non-integer inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
