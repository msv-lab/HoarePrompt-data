Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for the scenario where Limak and Bob start with the same weight. According to the problem description, if Limak's weight is equal to Bob's weight at the beginning, Limak should become larger than Bob after one year. In the code implementation, when the input is `1 1`, it enters the loop and multiplies both weights, resulting in `3` for Limak and `2` for Bob, leading to a count of `1` year, which is correct here. However, for the cases where their initial weights are equal but other than `1`, for example, `2 2`, `3 3`, ..., it will incorrectly assume that Limak has not become strictly larger until the calculation advances. The program would incorrectly return an indefinite "years" count unless considering equal conditions at input. 

Additionally, as Limak's weight is restricted to being never greater than Bob's weight at the start, the logic correctly handles the condition but fails to differentiate when they start equivalent. 

This inconsistency means that the program cannot handle all potential cases effectively, thus yielding a false correctness judgment on its overall operation. 

For example, for input `2 2`, the loop would go on indefinitely leading to incorrect results, as Limak would take 1 year to surpass but the code wouldn't count correctly due to the while condition.

Thus, the program is faulty in its robustness against initial equal weights leading to incorrect outputs in at least those circumstances.
