Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here is the step-by-step explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from the input which represent Limak's and Bob's weights respectively. It correctly uses `map(int, input().split())` to parse these values from a single line of input.

2. **Logic of Weight Growth:** The weights of Limak and Bob increase in the following manner: 
    - Limak's weight is tripled every year (`a *= 3`).
    - Bob's weight is doubled every year (`b *= 2`).
   This matches the problem description, which states that Limak's weight increases by a factor of 3 and Bob’s by a factor of 2 each year.

3. **Loop Condition:** The program uses a `while a <= b` loop to continue iterating until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. This reflects the requirement that Limak must become "strictly larger than" Bob.

4. **Count of Years:** A counter variable, `years`, is incremented in each iteration of the loop, accurately counting the number of full years it takes for Limak to become heavier than Bob.

5. **Output:** After the loop completes, the program prints the number of years required, which is exactly what the problem statement asks for.

The program appropriately handles the range of the input as per the constraints given (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), and it will correctly output the number of years required for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's weight for any valid input values within this range.

Since the program matches the outlined requirements in every potential case according to the problem statement, the correctness is confirmed.
