The program provided simulates the weight gain of Limak and Bob over the years, where Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles each year. It counts the number of years required for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

Looking at the function, we find that it receives two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the respective weights of Limak and Bob. The loop continues incrementing the `years` counter until Limak’s weight (`a`) becomes strictly greater than Bob’s weight (`b`). According to the output hints, the program appears to account for the condition when Limak and Bob have the same starting weight, as the loop executes at least once in such a scenario, due to the condition `a <= b`.

Through various scenarios based on the problem's constraints:

1. If Limak starts with a weight less than Bob's, the loop will run until Limak surpasses Bob.
2. If Limak starts with the same weight as Bob, the loop will still run once before the condition is no longer satisfied.

Reviewing specific inputs given in the problem statement, all cases yield correct outputs:

- **Example 1 (`4 7`)**: After 1 year (12, 14) → not larger; After 2 years (36, 28) → larger. Output is `2`.
- **Example 2 (`4 9`)**: After years {1: (12, 18), 2: (36, 36), 3: (108, 72)}. Output is `3`.
- **Example 3 (`1 1`)**: After year 1 (3, 2), Limak is larger. Output is `1`.

All these cases match the expected outputs exactly.

Thus, based on the problem description and the output hints confirming the functionality of the code across all cases provided:

Correctness: **True**.
