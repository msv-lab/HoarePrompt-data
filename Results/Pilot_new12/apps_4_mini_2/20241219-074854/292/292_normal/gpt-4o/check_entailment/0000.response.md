Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly simulates the growth of Limak and Bob's weights over the years. It uses a while loop to multiply Limak's weight by 3 and Bob's weight by 2 until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until the specified condition (Limak being strictly heavier than Bob) is met. 

The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly:
- For input `4 7`, after 2 years Limak becomes heavier (weights are 36 and 28 respectively).
- For input `4 9`, after 3 years Limak becomes heavier (weights are 108 and 72).
- For input `1 1`, Limak becomes heavier after the first year (weights are 3 and 2).

The program adheres to the requirements and handles all edge cases relevant to the specified input range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). Therefore, it fulfills the problem description correctly.
