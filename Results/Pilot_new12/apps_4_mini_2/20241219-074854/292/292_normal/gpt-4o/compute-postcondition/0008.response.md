`b` is doubled, which means `b` is now equal to `2 * original b`. Since `b` must be at least equal to the original value of `a`, and `a` satisfies `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`, the new value of `b` will now be at least `2 * a`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`; `b` is now at least `2 * original value of a`.
Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`; `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`.**
