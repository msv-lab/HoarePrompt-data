The variable `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`, this means the new value of `a` will be in the range `27 ≤ a ≤ 90`. The variable `b` is not affected by this operation. The variable `years` has been incremented by 1, but its previous value is not provided, so it remains uncertain. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer satisfying `27 ≤ a ≤ 90`; `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `27 ≤ a ≤ 90`; `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1.**
