The value of `b` is modified by multiplying it by 2. Given that `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, the new value of `b` will range from `2` (when `b` is `1`) to `20` (when `b` is `10`). The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying `3 ≤ a ≤ 10`, `b` is an integer satisfying `2 ≤ b ≤ 20`, `years` is 0**
