The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, where `a` represents Limak's weight and `b` represents Bob's weight. Based on the constraints provided, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the weights of Limak and Bob while ensuring they fall within the specified range. However, the output details or logic based on these inputs have not been provided. Therefore, the exact return value of the function cannot be determined from the information given.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, both integers with a as Limak's weight and b as Bob's weight, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10.**
