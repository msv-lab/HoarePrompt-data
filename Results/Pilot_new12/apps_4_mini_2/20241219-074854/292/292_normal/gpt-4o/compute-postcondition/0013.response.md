The variable `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than it was before. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation but remain bounded by their initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer satisfying `27 ≤ a ≤ 90`; `b` is at least `4 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `27 ≤ a ≤ 90`; `b` is at least `4 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1.**
