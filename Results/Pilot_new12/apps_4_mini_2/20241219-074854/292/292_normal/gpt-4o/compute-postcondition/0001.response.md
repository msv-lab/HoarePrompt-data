The variable `years` is initialized to 0. The initial conditions regarding the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the initialization of `years` does not impact them. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `years` is now set to 0, while `a` and `b` continue to satisfy their previous conditions.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`; `b` is an input integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`; `years` is 0**
