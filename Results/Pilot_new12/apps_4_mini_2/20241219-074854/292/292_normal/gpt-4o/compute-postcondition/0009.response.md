The variable `years` is incremented by 1, but the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Given that `a` is between 9 and 30, and `b` is at least double the original value of `a`, we know that `years` is now equal to its previous value plus one, while `a` and `b` maintain their respective constraints.

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`; `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1**
