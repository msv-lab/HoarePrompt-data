The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Given that `a` is an input integer satisfying `3 ≤ a ≤ 10`, the new value of `a` will be between 9 and 30, since the minimum value of `a` can be 3 (which results in 9) and the maximum can be 10 (which results in 30). The variable `b` remains equal to or greater than the original value of `a`, but the specifics of `b` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`; `b` must be at least equal to the original value of `a`.**
