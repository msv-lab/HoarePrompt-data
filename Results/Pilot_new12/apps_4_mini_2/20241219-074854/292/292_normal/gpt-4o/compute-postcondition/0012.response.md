The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Given the initial state that `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`, after executing the code, `b` will still be greater than or equal to `4 * original value of a`. The variable `years` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The state of variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `27 ≤ a ≤ 90`; `b` is at least `4 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1.**
