The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. The initial state tells us that `a` is an input integer, and it will now be updated. Since `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, the possible values for `a` after the operation (multiplying by 3) will be limited to `3, 6, or 9` depending on the initial input. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and `years` also remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying `3 ≤ a ≤ 10`, `b` is an input integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, `years` is 0**.
