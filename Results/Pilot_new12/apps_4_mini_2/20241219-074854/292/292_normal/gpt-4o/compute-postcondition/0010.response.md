According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30` and `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`. Since `a` is at a minimum of 9, it will certainly be less than or equal to `b` given that `b` is at least double the original value of `a`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without the need for adjustments to the state.

State: **`a` is an integer satisfying `9 ≤ a ≤ 30`; `b` is at least `2 * original value of a`; `years` is incremented by 1**
