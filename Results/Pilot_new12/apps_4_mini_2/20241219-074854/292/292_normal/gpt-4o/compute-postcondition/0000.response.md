The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input received, which is a pair of integers. The condition states that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, meaning `a` can take any integer value between 1 and `b`, inclusive, and `b` can be any integer between `a` and 10. Therefore, after executing the code, `a` and `b` will hold whatever values are input, but they will still satisfy the condition provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`; `b` is an input integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`.**
