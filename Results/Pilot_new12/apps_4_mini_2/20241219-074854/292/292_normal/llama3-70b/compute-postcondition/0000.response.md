The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from `input()` split and converted to integers. The initial constraints are that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. The specific values of `a` and `b` will depend on the input provided, which is not available in this case. Therefore, we can only state that `a` and `b` are now both integers, and their values are determined by the user input while still adhering to the provided constraints.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and b, `b` is an integer between a and 10 where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10**
