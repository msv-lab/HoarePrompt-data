According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, and `b` is between `a` and 20. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `a` should still be less than or equal to `b`. Since `b` is greater than `a` at the moment, `b` must be at least equal to `a`. However, since `a` can go up to `3b`, if `b` is less than `3`, `a` would be unable to continue.

For the loop to execute again, `b` should not exceed `3b`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` remains sufficiently large relative to `a`. In this context, `b` must be greater than or equal to `a`, which resides between 3 and `3b`. 

In summary, we want to ensure `b` must be greater than `a` or equal to `a` so:
State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` must be greater than or equal to `a`, `years` is 1**
