The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` is equal to or greater than 9, after multiplying, `b` will still be greater than or equal to 18. The range for `a` remains the same: it is still between 27 and `27b`. The value of `years` remains unchanged at 2. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is between 27 and `27b`, `b` is greater than or equal to 18, `years` is 2**
