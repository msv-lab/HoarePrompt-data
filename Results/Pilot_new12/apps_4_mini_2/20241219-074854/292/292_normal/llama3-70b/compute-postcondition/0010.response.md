According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is between 9 and `9b`, meaning `a` can be either 9 or some value less than `9b`. Since `b` has been multiplied by 2, we need to ensure that `b` is now sufficient to allow `a` to be less than or equal to it.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, `b` should be adjusted to be at least 9 (since `a` could be as low as 9 and must be less than or equal to `b`).

State: **`a` is between 9 and `9b`, `b` must be equal to or greater than 9, `years` is 2**
