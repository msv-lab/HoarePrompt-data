The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The value of `b` increases, reflecting that it is now between `a` and 20 (since `b` can originally range up to 10). Thus, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` is now between `a` and 20; `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` is between `a` and 20; `years` is 0**.
