In the given code, `b` is multiplied by 2, and since there are no explicit values provided for `b`, we cannot determine an exact new value for it. However, we do know that `b` must be greater than or equal to the previous value of `a`, meaning `b` will either maintain or increase relative to `a` after multiplication. 

Before the operation:
- `a` is between 9 and `9b` (which implies `b` could be a non-negative integer, and `a` is effectively bounded below by 9).
- `years` remains unchanged and is equal to 1.

After the operation:
- `b` is now doubled.

Output State: **`a` is between 9 and `9b`, `b` is multiplied by 2, `years` is 1**
