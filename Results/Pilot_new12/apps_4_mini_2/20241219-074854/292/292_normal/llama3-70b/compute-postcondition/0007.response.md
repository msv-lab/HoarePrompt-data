The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Given that `a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, multiplying `a` by 3 will result in a new value for `a` which lies between 9 and `9b`. The variables `b` and `years` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is now between 9 and `9b`, `b` must be greater than or equal to the previous value of `a`, `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is between 9 and `9b`, `b` must be greater than or equal to the previous value of `a`, `years` is 1**
