`a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, and `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, the new value of `a` will be between 3 and `3b`. The value of `years` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10; `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10; `years` is 0**
