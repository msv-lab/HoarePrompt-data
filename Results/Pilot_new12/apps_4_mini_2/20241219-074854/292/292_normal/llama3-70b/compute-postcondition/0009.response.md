The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `years` is 1, so after the execution of the code, the new value of `years` will be 2. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is between 9 and `9b`, `b` is multiplied by 2, and `years` is now 2.

Output State: **`a` is between 9 and `9b`, `b` is multiplied by 2, `years` is 2**.
