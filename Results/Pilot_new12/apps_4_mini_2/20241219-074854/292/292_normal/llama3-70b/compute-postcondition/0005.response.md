`years` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` is between `a` and 20, `years` is now 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and `3b`, `b` is between `a` and 20, `years` is 1**
