According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop can execute if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Right before the loop, `a` is between 1 and `b`, and `b` is between `a` and 10. Since `1 ≤ a ≤ b` is guaranteed by the constraints, for the loop to execute the first time, the current values of `a` and `b` must satisfy `a ≤ b`.

No other states need to be adjusted as it is ensured that `a` is always less than or equal to `b` given the initial state provided.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10, `years` is 0**.
