In the given initial state, `a` is between 9 and `9b`, `b` is equal to or greater than 9, and `years` is 2. The operation `a *= 3` means that the value of `a` will be updated to three times its current value.

Since `a` is initially between 9 and `9b`, after multiplying by 3, the new range of `a` will be between 27 and `27b` (because multiplying the minimum value of 9 by 3 gives 27, and multiplying the maximum value of `9b` by 3 gives `27b`).

The values for `b` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`a` is between 27 and `27b`, `b` is equal to or greater than 9, `years` is 2**
