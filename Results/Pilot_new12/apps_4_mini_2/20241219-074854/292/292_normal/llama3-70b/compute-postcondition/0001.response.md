In the given code, the variable `years` is initialized to `0`. The previous states of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged since they are not modified by this code snippet. 

The variable `years` has now been assigned a value of `0`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and `b`, `b` is an integer between `a` and 10 where 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `years` is 0.**
