Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the problem description requirements as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers `a` (Limak's weight) and `b` (Bob's weight) from input. It ensures that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, which is in accordance with the problem's constraints.

2. **Weight Calculation**: The program correctly implements the weight changes after each year. Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`) every year as specified in the problem description.

3. **Loop Condition**: The while loop continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`. This prevents the loop from exiting prematurely and ensures that it only counts the years until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.

4. **Count of Years**: The variable `years` is incremented each time through the loop, effectively counting the number of full years it takes for Limak's weight to surpass Bob's.

5. **Output**: After exiting the loop, the program outputs the total number of years required for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob, which is exactly what is requested in the problem description.

Thus, the program behaves correctly for the defined problem, ensuring that it accounts for all potential cases given the constraints. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program follows the problem description accurately.
