Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for the case where Limak's weight (a) is equal to Bob's weight (b) in the beginning and Limak needs to exceed Bob's weight in the very first year. 

Consider the input case:
```
1 1
```
According to the problem statement, after 1 year, Limak's weight would become 3 (1 * 3) and Bob's weight would become 2 (1 * 2). Limak will be larger than Bob after 1 year, which is consistent with the expected output of 1.

However, if we look at the input:
```
10 10
```
The weights would update to:
- After year 1: Limak = 30 and Bob = 20.
As Limak's initial and Bob's initial weight is equal, there is no explicit check in the program for the case when they both start out equal. The program correctly increments years as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's, but it will still return a year count even when they may both start equal, which means the condition of becoming "strictly larger" hasnâ€™t been met at year 0 (since they should not just be equal).

Thus, the lack of a specific check for when Limak's weight equals Bob's at the start, preventing a scenario where Limak does not become strictly larger even after a weight update, leads to incorrect outputs in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
