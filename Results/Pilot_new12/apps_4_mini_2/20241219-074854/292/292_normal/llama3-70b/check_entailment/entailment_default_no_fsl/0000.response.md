Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the described functionality. It takes two integers as input, representing the weights of Limak and Bob, and simulates their weight changes over the years according to the specified growth rates—Limak's weight triples while Bob's weight doubles each year.

1. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The condition in the while loop (`a <= b`) ensures that it counts the number of years correctly.
2. It correctly increments a counter (`years`) each time the loop runs, which accurately reflects the number of years it takes for Limak to surpass Bob.
3. The output matches the expected result from the given examples.

The function effectively handles all potential cases within the defined input constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), including when both weights are equal, or when different initial weights are given. Since it fulfills the requirements as stated in the problem description without missing any potential scenarios, the program is indeed correct.

Therefore, it prints the number of complete years after which Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight as required.
