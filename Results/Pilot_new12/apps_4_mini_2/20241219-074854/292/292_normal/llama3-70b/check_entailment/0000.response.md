Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes Limak's and Bob's weights, and then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The condition in the while loop (`a <= b`) correctly ensures that Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, which means it effectively counts the years required for that condition to be met. Based on the problem's constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program handles all specified cases correctly, including cases like when a = 1 and b = 1, where it correctly computes that Limak becomes heavier after one year. Thus, there are no potential edge cases or missing logic that would lead to incorrect results.
