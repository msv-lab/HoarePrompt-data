Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description. Here is a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The constraints specified (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) are adhered to, as the program expects the input to be in this format.

2. **Weight Increase Logic**: The program simulates the yearly weight changes:
   - Limak's weight (`a`) is tripled every year (`a *= 3`).
   - Bob's weight (`b`) is doubled every year (`b *= 2`).
   This follows the problem description's stipulation that Limak's weight increases at a faster rate than Bob's.

3. **Year Count**: The `years` variable is initialized to 0 and is incremented each time the loop runs while Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). This accurately counts the number of full years it takes for Limak to exceed Bob's weight.

4. **Loop Termination**: The loop condition (`while a <= b`) ensures that the loop will continue until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's. As soon as Limak's weight is greater, the loop exits, and the program prints the number of years.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of years as an integer, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description to output the result in this manner.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program deals with edge cases appropriately:
   - When both weights start equal (e.g., `1 1`), Limak's weight will surpass Bob's after one year, which is correctly handled.
   - The program correctly processes the maximum weights specified by the constraints.

Since the program operates as described without any discrepancies, it adheres to the problem requirements under all valid conditions given the constraints. Thus, it is correct.
