Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It takes two integers as input representing the weights of Limak and Bob, with Limak's weight being less than or equal to Bob's weight. The loop continues while Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's each year. The number of years is counted, and once Limak's weight surpasses Bob's, it prints the count.

The output hints accurately summarize the function's purpose and logic. It accounts for the edge case where Limakâ€™s and Bob's initial weights are the same (e.g., when both weights are 1) and correctly calculates the years required for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob in all valid cases specified in the problem.

Thus, after verifying that the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
