You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for the case where Limak's weight (a) is equal to Bob's weight (b) in the beginning and Limak needs to exceed Bob's weight in the very first year. 

Consider the input case:
```
1 1
```
According to the problem statement, after 1 year, Limak's weight would become 3 (1 * 3) and Bob's weight would become 2 (1 * 2). Limak will be larger than Bob after 1 year, which is consistent with the expected output of 1.

However, if we look at the input:
```
10 10
```
The weights would update to:
- After year 1: Limak = 30 and Bob = 20.
As Limak's initial and Bob's initial weight is equal, there is no explicit check in the program for the case when they both start out equal. The program correctly increments years as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's, but it will still return a year count even when they may both start equal, which means the condition of becoming "strictly larger" hasn’t been met at year 0 (since they should not just be equal).

Thus, the lack of a specific check for when Limak's weight equals Bob's at the start, preventing a scenario where Limak does not become strictly larger even after a weight update, leads to incorrect outputs in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes two integer inputs representing the weights of Limak (a) and Bob (b), where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It simulates a scenario where Limak’s weight triples and Bob’s weight doubles each year until Limak’s weight surpasses Bob’s weight. The function counts the number of years it takes for Limak’s weight to become greater than Bob’s weight and returns this count as output. The final state of the function is that it prints the number of years required for Limak to outgrow Bob. Edge cases include when a and b are the same or when they are at their minimum or maximum input constraints (1, 1) and (10, 10), respectively. Additionally, the function does not handle any inputs outside the specified range, and the exact behavior is undefined in such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
