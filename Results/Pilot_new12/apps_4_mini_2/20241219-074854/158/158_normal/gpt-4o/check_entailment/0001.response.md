Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratios of 1:2:4. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It takes the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) as input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the available fruits:
   - It checks how many lemons can be used by taking the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`),
     - The number of apples available divided by 2 (`b // 2`), and
     - The number of pears available divided by 4 (`c // 4`).
3. Using the calculated maximum number of lemons, it computes the total count of fruits used:
   - Each lemon contributes 1 to the total,
   - Each lemon requires 2 apples, thus it contributes 2,
   - Each lemon requires 4 pears, thus it contributes 4.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

The program handles edge cases as specified in the problem description:
- If there aren't enough pears, apples, or lemons to meet the required ratio, the total will be zero, which is correctly handled by the calculations.

Since the program covers all necessary aspects of the problem and passes all the given examples, it is correct.
