To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program in the context of the requirements.

The problem states that:
- The ratio of lemons, apples, and pears should be 1:2:4.
- For each lemon used, there should be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.
- We need to calculate the maximum total fruits used that respects this ratio.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. The function reads integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.
   
2. It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
   - `a`, which is the total number of lemons available.
   - `b // 2`, which represents the maximum lemons that can be accommodated by the number of apples since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - `c // 4`, which represents the maximum lemons that can be accommodated by the number of pears since each lemon requires 4 pears.

3. Using `max_lemons`, it computes `total_fruits` as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` for lemons.
   - `max_lemons * 2` for apples.
   - `max_lemons * 4` for pears.

4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits that can be used.

### Checking Against the Problem Description:

- The program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and the required ratio.
- It respects the constraints of the problem (not breaking fruits into pieces, etc.).
- It also handles edge cases where one type of fruit might not be sufficient to form even one complete set (e.g., if `a`, `b`, or `c` is too low relative to the others).

### Conclusion:

The program meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use based on the input fruit counts while adhering to the specified ratio.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
