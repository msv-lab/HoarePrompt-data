Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of complete fruit combinations that can be made using the given quantities of lemons, apples, and pears, adhering to the required ratios of 1:2:4.

Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. It reads the inputs for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It computes `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
   - Number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`) since each combination needs 2 apples.
   - One-fourth the number of pears available (`c // 4`) since each combination needs 4 pears.
3. It calculates the total number of fruits used in the combinations by the formula `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used, which satisfies the output requirement of the problem.

The program correctly handles the potential edge cases as per the problem description since:
- The minimum values of lemons, apples, and pears allow the program to produce a correct result (zero if not enough fruits are available).
- The provided examples have been verified against the logic implemented within the code.

Since there are no edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output according to the problem requirements, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
