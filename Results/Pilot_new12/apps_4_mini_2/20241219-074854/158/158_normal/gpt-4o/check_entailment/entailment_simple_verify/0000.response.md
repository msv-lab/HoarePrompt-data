The annotated version of the program provides a clear explanation of the state right before the function call, emphasizing that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, which is consistent with the problem description. The original assessment accurately describes how the program calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

The logic within the program uses the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. This ensures that the used fruits adhere to the required ratios and maximizes the total fruit count without exceeding the available fruits. After calculating `max_lemons`, the total number of fruits used is computed correctly by summing the respective counts based on `max_lemons`.

The annotated code does not indicate any errors or oversights in the logic. Given that the input will always be valid as per the problem constraints, the assessment of correctness holds as there are no edge cases that would lead to an incorrect output.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
