Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote according to the specified ratio of lemons, apples, and pears (1:2:4). It uses the minimum of the number of lemons `a`, half the number of apples `b//2`, and a quarter of the number of pears `c//4` to determine the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used. The total number of fruits used is then calculated and printed as required. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) and the logic to handle all edge cases correctly, the program will yield accurate results for any valid input within the specified limits.
