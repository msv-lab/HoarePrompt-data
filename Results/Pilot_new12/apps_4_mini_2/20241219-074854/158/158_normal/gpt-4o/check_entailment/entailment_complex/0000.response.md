Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three positive integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The problem states that all inputs are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and the program accepts input accordingly without raising any errors.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program correctly determines the maximum number of combinations of fruits that can be made following the required ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. This is done using the line:
   ```python
   max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   Here, `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that we are constrained by the available counts of each fruit, correctly implementing the ratio requirements defined in the problem.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as follows:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This formula accurately adds up the lemons, apples, and pears used based on the calculated `max_lemons`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits used, which matches the expected output defined in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where it's impossible to make any compote (e.g., not enough pears) appropriately by correctly returning a total of `0` when `max_lemons` evaluates to `0`.

Overall, the logic implemented in the program conforms to the constraints and requirements laid out in the problem description. Since it accurately calculates the maximum total of fruits Nikolay can use based on the parameters provided, the program can be considered correct. Hence, the output is `True`.
