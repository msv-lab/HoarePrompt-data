The provided code attempts to solve the problem of determining how many fruits Nikolay can use to cook compote based on the specified ratio of lemons, apples, and pears. The logic correctly calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears, which reflects the ratio of 1:2:4 required for the compote. Then, it computes the total number of fruits from these usable combinations. 

The code has been structured to handle the given problem as per the description. Specifically:

1. It reads three integer inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. It accurately calculates how many full sets can be made using the available fruits while respecting the specified ratio.
3. It returns correct outputs for the provided examples â€” for instance:
   - Example input `2, 5, 7` leads to `1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears` which sums to 7.
   - Example input `4, 7, 13` leads to `3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears` which sums to 21.
   - Example input `2, 3, 2` yields `0` since there aren't enough pears.

However, we must note that the function assumes valid positive integer input as described and does not account for any exception handling. This is stated to be acceptable within the scope of the task since the inputs are assured to be valid by the problem statement.

Since there are no cases where the code fails to meet the problem's requirements based on the description and examples provided, we conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
