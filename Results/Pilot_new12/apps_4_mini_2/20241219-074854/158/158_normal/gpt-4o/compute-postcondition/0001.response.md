The value of `b` is assigned from an input integer, which replaces its previous positive integer value. The initial state indicates that `b` was between 1 and 1000, but as it is now replaced by an input, we do not have a specific value for `b` after this assignment. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged, while `b` now holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer, with 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000.**
