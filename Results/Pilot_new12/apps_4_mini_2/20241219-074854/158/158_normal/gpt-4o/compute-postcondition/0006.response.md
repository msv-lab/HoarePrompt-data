The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it implicitly handles three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. The constraints ensure that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are each within the range of 1 to 1000.

Since there are no specific conditions or cases provided regarding the output, we note that the functionality pertains only to the acceptance of the parameters and their nature. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process three positive integers representing quantities of different fruits.

Functionality: **The function implicitly handles three positive integer parameters: a (lemons), b (apples), and c (pears), each between 1 and 1000.**
