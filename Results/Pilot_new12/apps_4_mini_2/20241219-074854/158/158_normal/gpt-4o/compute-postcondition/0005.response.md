The provided code snippet prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated based on the previously defined `max_lemons`. Specifically, `max_lemons` is the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`. While executing this print statement, the only alteration is that `total_fruits` is being output. 

The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, while `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` hold their calculated values based on the inputs. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer; `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`; `total_fruits` is equal to `7 * max_lemons`, and the value of `total_fruits` has been printed.**
