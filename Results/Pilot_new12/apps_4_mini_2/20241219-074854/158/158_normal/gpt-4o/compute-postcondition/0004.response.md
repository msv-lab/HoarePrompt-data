In the given code snippet, `total_fruits` is calculated using the formula:

```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

Where `max_lemons` is defined as:

```
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```

This means that `max_lemons` will hold the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

The calculation for `total_fruits` can be simplified:

```
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
```

Thus, the `total_fruits` will be equal to `7 * max_lemons`.

The other variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `total_fruits` is newly calculated.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer; `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`; `total_fruits` is equal to `7 * max_lemons`**.
