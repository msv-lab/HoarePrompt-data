In the provided code snippet, `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their statuses as input integers where:

- `a` is a positive integer,
- `b` is an input integer,
- `c` is an input integer as obtained from `int(input())`.

The value of `max_lemons` becomes the smallest value among these three calculated expressions.

Thus, the output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the new calculated value for `max_lemons` based on the provided expressions. The specific value of `max_lemons` can be expressed in terms of the variables as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer; `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**.
