Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It computes the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the compote by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`) since it takes 2 apples for each lemon.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`) since it takes 4 pears for each lemon.
   
3. The variable `min_lemon` then holds the maximum number of complete sets that can be formed.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used, calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which represents the sum of the used lemons, apples, and pears.

All provided test cases demonstrate the program returning the correct results based on the inputs. Additionally, the program correctly handles the case when there are not enough fruits to form even one complete set of compote, resulting in an output of 0.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
