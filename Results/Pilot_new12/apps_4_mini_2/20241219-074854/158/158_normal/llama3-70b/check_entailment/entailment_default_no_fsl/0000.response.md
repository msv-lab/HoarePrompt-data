Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in making the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4.

In the function, the variable `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of:
- the number of lemons `a`
- half the number of apples `b // 2` (since for each lemon, 2 apples are required)
- a quarter of the number of pears `c // 4` (since for each lemon, 4 pears are required)

The total number of fruits used (`min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`) simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`, confirming that the function sums the required quantities according to the recipe. 

The operation properly handles all potential cases where the total number of fruits can be 0 (for example, when there are not enough pears to meet the requirement), as demonstrated in the example provided where the outputs are consistent with the given problem conditions. There are no missed edge cases or logic flaws evident from the analysis of the program and its output.
