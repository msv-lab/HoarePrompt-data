To determine the correctness of the given Python program that calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook compote according to the specified ratio, I will analyze both the program and the output hints.

### Program Analysis
The program reads three integers, representing the quantities of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). It then calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the ratio 1:2:4 by finding the minimum of:
- `a`: the number of lemons available
- `b // 2`: the maximum number of apples that can be paired with the lemons (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon)
- `c // 4`: the maximum number of pears that can be paired with the lemons (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon)

The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as:
```
min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
```
This simplifies to:
```
min_lemon * 7
```

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints clarify that the function computes the total number of fruits successfully based on the ratios provided and does so according to the logic explained previously. However, it also mentions that the function doesn’t handle validation for input ranges (which is not required here as we are assuming valid input).

### Testing against Examples
Let’s analyze the provided examples against the program:

1. **Inputs: 2, 5, 7**
   - Minimum calculated: `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Total fruits: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`
   - **Output:** 7 (Correct)

2. **Inputs: 4, 7, 13**
   - Minimum calculated: `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Total fruits: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`
   - **Output:** 21 (Correct)

3. **Inputs: 2, 3, 2**
   - Minimum calculated: `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Total fruits: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - **Output:** 0 (Correct)

All provided examples return the expected outputs, and the program logic adheres to the problem requirements to calculate the maximum number of fruits following the 1:2:4 ratio.

### Conclusion
The program functions correctly for all input cases, delivering the correct outputs without any edge case failures as per the constraints specified. Therefore, the assessment concludes that the program meets the correctness criteria.

Correctness: **True**.
