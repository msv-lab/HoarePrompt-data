Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from standard input, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay has. The problem description specifies that these values will be positive integers ranging from 1 to 1000.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The function calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of:
   - `a`: the number of lemons available,
   - `b // 2`: the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the apples available since for every lemon, two apples are needed,
   - `c // 4`: the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the pears available since for every lemon, four pears are needed.
   
   This correctly implements the recipe's required ratio of fruits (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears).

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated with the formula: 
   ```
   min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
   ```
   This simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`, which effectively counts all the fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used as determined by the earlier minimum calculation. 

4. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the edge case where there are not enough fruits to form even one complete ratio (e.g., not enough pears). In such a case, `min_lemon` would be `0`, leading to an output of `0`, which aligns with what is expected.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the total number of fruits that can be used for the compote, which matches the requirement of the problem statement.

Overall, the program effectively and correctly implements the logic from the problem description, ensuring that it adheres to the specified fruit ratios and handles both typical and edge cases as required.
