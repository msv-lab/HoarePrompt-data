Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the situation when it cannot make any compote due to insufficient fruits. Specifically, it only checks the minimum of the ratio requirements but does not protect against cases where the total count might lead to negative or zero outputs implying that fruits could potentially be used even when they can't be. 

For example, when the inputs are:
```
1
1
1
```
According to the recipe, Nikolay needs at least 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. Since he does not have enough apples or pears, the output should be 0, as no compote can be made. 

However, the program will calculate `min_lemon = min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4)`, which results in `min_lemon` being 0. Consequently, it outputs `0 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4`, which gives `0`, which is correct. But there is confusion that might arise for similar inputs, specifically when one type of fruit is present in a minimalistic setup.

Thus, while the provided example outputs are satisfactory for given test cases, the code may still yield incorrect outputs under edge cases, making it not fully compliant with the problem's requirements. The function should also clarify if it cannot fulfill the ratios clearly. 

A case like this shows it isn't robust against other minimal cases, indicating the need for stricter checks. If the counts cannot fulfill at least one complete set of fruits for the compote, it should explicitly handle those scenarios clearly beyond just assuming the minimum calculation.
