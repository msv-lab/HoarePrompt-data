You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It computes the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the compote by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`) since it takes 2 apples for each lemon.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`) since it takes 4 pears for each lemon.
   
3. The variable `min_lemon` then holds the maximum number of complete sets that can be formed.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used, calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which represents the sum of the used lemons, apples, and pears.

All provided test cases demonstrate the program returning the correct results based on the inputs. Additionally, the program correctly handles the case when there are not enough fruits to form even one complete set of compote, resulting in an output of 0.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.



Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, respectively, with 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integer inputs representing the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears (denoted by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively). It computes the minimum value among the number of lemons available, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears. The function then calculates a total based on this minimum value, using the formula `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`. Finally, it prints this total. The function does not return any value and lacks validation for the input ranges stated in the annotations (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), nor does it handle edge cases outside these constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
