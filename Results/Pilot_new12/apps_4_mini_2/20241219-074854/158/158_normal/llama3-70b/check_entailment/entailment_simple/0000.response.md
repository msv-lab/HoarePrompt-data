To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the description and the annotated program.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
- Nikolay has three types of fruits: lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).
- The required ratio for making the compote is 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears.
- The task is to find the maximum total number of fruits that can be used while maintaining this ratio.
- If he doesn't have enough fruits to maintain the ratio, the output should be 0.

### Annotated Program Breakdown:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads inputs for the number of lemons, apples, and pears as integers.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Fruit Usage**:
   - The calculation `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` is checking how many complete sets of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears can be made. 
     - `b // 2` computes how many apples can support using lemons, and `c // 4` computes how many pears can support using lemons.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The total number of fruits used is calculated as:
     - Total fruits = `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`.

### Comparison with Problem Description:
- The program correctly computes the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used to maintain the specified ratio.
- If the minimum number of lemons (`min_lemon`) calculated is 0, it means not enough fruits are available to form a complete set, and the output will also be 0, which adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program fulfills all requirements as per the problem description. It reads the input correctly, calculates the maximum set of fruits that can be taken in the specified ratio, and outputs the expected value according to the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
