To compute the output state, we first need to analyze the provided code and the initial state. 

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input positive integer
- `min_lemon` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

The code snippet executes:
```
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be simplified:
   - `min_lemon * 2` equals twice the value of `min_lemon`
   - `min_lemon * 4` equals four times the value of `min_lemon`
   - Thus, the entire expression can be represented as `min_lemon + 2 * min_lemon + 4 * min_lemon`, which simplifies to `7 * min_lemon`.

2. The print statement then outputs the value of `7 * min_lemon`.

Now, we summarize the values of the variables that remain unchanged except for `min_lemon`, which is directly calculated as a function of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain input integers and remain unchanged since they are not modified.
- `min_lemon` is now defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `min_lemon` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**.
