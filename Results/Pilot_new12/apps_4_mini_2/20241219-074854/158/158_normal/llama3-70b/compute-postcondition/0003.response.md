`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Given that `a` and `b` are input integers and `c` is an input positive integer, the output state will reflect that `min_lemon` is determined based on these values. The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
