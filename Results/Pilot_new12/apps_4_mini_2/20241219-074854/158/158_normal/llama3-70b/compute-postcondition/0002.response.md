The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, while `c` will hold the new input value which is expected to be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input positive integer**
