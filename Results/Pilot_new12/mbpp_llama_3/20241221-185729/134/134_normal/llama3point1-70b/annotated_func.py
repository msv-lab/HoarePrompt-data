#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 2^(n-1), `i` is `n`.
    return sum
    #The program returns 2^(n-1) where n is a positive integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns the sum of combinations of `n` choose `i`, where `i` is an even number from 0 to `n`. The returned value is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of `n-1`, but this is an emergent property of the calculation rather than an explicit operation in the code. The function does not modify the input `n` and only calculates and returns the specified sum. It assumes that `n` is a positive integer and does not handle cases where `n` might be 0, negative, or non-integer, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if not validated before calling the function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that of having returned the calculated sum, with no side effects on external state.
