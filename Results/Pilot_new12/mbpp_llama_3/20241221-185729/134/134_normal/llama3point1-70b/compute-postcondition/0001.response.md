According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, the loop will definitely execute. The loop will iterate from `0` to `n` (inclusive), because the range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, and the stop value here is `n + 1`. So, for the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to `0`, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
