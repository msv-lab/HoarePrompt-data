According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The loop will execute again if `i` (which is 2) is less than `n + 1`. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute when `i` is 2, but since `n` is already a positive integer, it is already at least 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2**
