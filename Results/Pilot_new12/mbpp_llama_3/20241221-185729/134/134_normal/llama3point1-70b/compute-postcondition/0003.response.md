The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` updates the value of `sum` by adding the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to it. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is initially 0, and `i` is an even number (currently 0), we can calculate the new value of `sum` as follows:

`sum` is now equal to `math.comb(n, 0)`, which is equal to 1, since there is only one way to choose 0 items from `n` items.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0**
