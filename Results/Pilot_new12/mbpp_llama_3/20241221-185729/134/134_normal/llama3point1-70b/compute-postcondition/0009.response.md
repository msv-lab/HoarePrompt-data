To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2.

Code Snippet: `sum += math.comb(n, i)`

1. **Understanding the Code**: The code is adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order, which is essentially the binomial coefficient `n` choose `i`.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer.
   - `i` remains unchanged with a value of 2.
   - `sum` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to its current value. However, the initial value of `sum` is not specified. Assuming `sum` was initialized before this operation (since it's being used in an augmented assignment), its new value will be its previous value plus `math.comb(n, 2)`.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - `math.comb(n, 2)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time. This can be simplified to `n*(n-1)/2` because the formula for combinations is `n! / (i!(n-i)!)`, and for `i=2`, this simplifies to `n*(n-1)/2`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `sum` is now its previous value plus `n*(n-1)/2`.

Since the initial value of `sum` is not provided, and assuming it was previously defined and had some value, let's denote its initial value as `sum_initial`. After execution, `sum` would be `sum_initial + n*(n-1)/2`.

Given this analysis and adhering strictly to the required format without assuming initial values not provided:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `sum` is `sum_initial + n*(n-1)/2`, where `sum_initial` is the value of `sum` before this operation.**
