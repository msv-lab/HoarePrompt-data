Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function uses a loop to iterate over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the index `i` is even. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It handles all potential cases, including:

*   Handling `n = 0`, where the sum of even index binomial coefficients is 1 (since `math.comb(0, 0)` is 1).
*   Handling `n > 0`, where the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
*   Correctly using the `math.comb` function to calculate binomial coefficients, which was added in Python 3.8.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases. It correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for all positive integers `n`. Therefore, the program is correct, and its correctness is verified.
