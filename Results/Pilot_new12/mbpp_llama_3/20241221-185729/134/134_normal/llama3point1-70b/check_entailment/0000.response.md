Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. Here's why:

1. The function iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` using a for loop.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`).
3. If `i` is even, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
4. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from a set of `n` items, which is the definition of a binomial coefficient.

The function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When `n` is 0, the function returns 1, which is the sum of the even index binomial coefficient (i.e., `math.comb(0, 0)`).
* When `n` is 1, the function returns 1, which is the sum of the even index binomial coefficient (i.e., `math.comb(1, 0)`).
* When `n` is greater than 1, the function correctly calculates the sum of the even index binomial coefficients.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
