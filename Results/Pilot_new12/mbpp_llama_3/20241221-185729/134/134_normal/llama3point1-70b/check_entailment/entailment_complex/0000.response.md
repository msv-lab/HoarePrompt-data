Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes in a positive integer `n` as required by the problem description.
2. It calculates the sum of binomial coefficients where the index `i` is even, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.
3. The program uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the binomial coefficients, which is a correct and efficient way to do so.
4. The program iterates over the range `n + 1` to include all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n`, as required by the problem description.
5. The program only includes the binomial coefficients with even indices in the sum, as required by the problem description.
6. The program returns the calculated sum, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program's emergent property of returning 2 raised to the power of `n-1` is a consequence of the correct calculation of the sum of even index binomial coefficients, and it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program accurately implements the calculation described in the problem description, and it does so for every potential case where the input is a positive integer.
