Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. Here's why:

1. The program iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` using a for loop.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
3. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the running sum `sum`.
4. The program returns the sum after iterating over all indices.

The mathematical basis for this program is the binomial theorem, which states that the sum of binomial coefficients of the form `n choose k` is equal to `2^n`. However, in this case, we are only summing the even index binomial coefficients.

It is a known mathematical fact that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of the form `n choose k` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This can be seen by considering the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n`, and using the fact that the binomial coefficients are symmetric.

Since the program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
