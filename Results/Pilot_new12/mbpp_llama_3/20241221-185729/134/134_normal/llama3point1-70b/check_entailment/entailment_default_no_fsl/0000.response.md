Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. It iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checks if the current index `i` is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. 

The function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer, as stated in the problem description, and does not handle cases where `n` might be 0, negative, or non-integer. However, according to the instructions, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The output hints suggest that the function returns the sum of combinations of `n` choose `i`, where `i` is an even number from 0 to `n`, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. This property is indeed observed in the code's behavior, although it is not an explicit operation.

Since the code correctly implements the described functionality and assumes valid input, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
