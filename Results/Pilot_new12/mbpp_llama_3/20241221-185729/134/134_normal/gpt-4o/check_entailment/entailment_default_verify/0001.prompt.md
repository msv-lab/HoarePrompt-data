You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. 

The sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of (1 + 1)^n is equal to 2^(n-1). This is because the sum of all binomial coefficients in the expansion of (1 + 1)^n is 2^n, and the sum of even index coefficients is equal to the sum of odd index coefficients. 

Therefore, the sum of even index coefficients is 2^n / 2 = 2^(n-1), which is what the function func_1(n) returns.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for different inputs. 

In the expansion of (1 + 1)^n, the binomial coefficients are symmetric, i.e., the first and last coefficients are equal, the second and second last coefficients are equal, and so on. Therefore, the sum of even index coefficients will always be equal to the sum of odd index coefficients, which is 2^(n-1). 

Hence, the function func_1(n) correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for all positive integers n.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the power of 2. For `n` equal to 0, it returns 0.5, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of -1. For `n` greater than 0, it returns 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer, as it is not specified in the code, and it will return incorrect results for such inputs. Additionally, the function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the calculated value, without any side effects. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a value representing a power of 2, based on the input `n`, without altering any external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
