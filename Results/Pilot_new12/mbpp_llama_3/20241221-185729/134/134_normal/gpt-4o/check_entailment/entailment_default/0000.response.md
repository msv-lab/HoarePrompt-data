Correctness: **True**

The code given is `func_1(n) = 2 ** (n - 1)`. This function calculates the power of 2 raised to `n-1`. According to the problem description and binomial expansion properties, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients of order `n` is indeed `2 ** (n - 1)`. 

This property is based on the binomial theorem, which states that `(x + y)^n = Î£ (n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k` for `k = 0` to `n`. 

When `x` and `y` are both `1` and `n` is even, the sum of even index coefficients equals the sum of odd index coefficients, both being `2**(n-1)`. When `n` is odd, the sum of even index coefficients still equals `2**(n-1)`.

So, for a given `n`, the function correctly returns the sum of the even index binomial coefficients.

Since this function correctly calculates the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for all positive integers `n` (given that we are assuming the input is valid), we can conclude that the function is correct.
