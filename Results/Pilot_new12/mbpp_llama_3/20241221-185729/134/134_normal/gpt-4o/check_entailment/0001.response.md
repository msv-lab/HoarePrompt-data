Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. 

The sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of (1 + 1)^n is equal to 2^(n-1). This is because the sum of all binomial coefficients in the expansion of (1 + 1)^n is 2^n, and the sum of even index coefficients is equal to the sum of odd index coefficients. 

Therefore, the sum of even index coefficients is 2^n / 2 = 2^(n-1), which is what the function func_1(n) returns.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for different inputs. 

In the expansion of (1 + 1)^n, the binomial coefficients are symmetric, i.e., the first and last coefficients are equal, the second and second last coefficients are equal, and so on. Therefore, the sum of even index coefficients will always be equal to the sum of odd index coefficients, which is 2^(n-1). 

Hence, the function func_1(n) correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for all positive integers n.
