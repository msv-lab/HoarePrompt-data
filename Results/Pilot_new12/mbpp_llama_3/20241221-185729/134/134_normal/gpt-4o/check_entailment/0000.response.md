Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

To verify the correctness of the function, let's break down the problem description and the provided code. The binomial coefficients are the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`, which can be calculated using the formula `math.comb(n, k)`.

The sum of even index binomial coefficients can be calculated as follows:

- For `n = 4`, the expansion of `(1 + 1)^4` is `1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1`, and the sum of even index binomial coefficients is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`, which matches the output of `func_1(4)`.

- For `n = 6`, the expansion of `(1 + 1)^6` is `1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1`, and the sum of even index binomial coefficients is `1 + 15 + 20 + 1 = 37`, however, the provided code `func_1(6)` returns `32`. 

However, upon re-examining the calculations, it appears that there was a mistake in the manual calculation. 

For `n = 6`, the correct calculation of the sum of even index binomial coefficients is indeed `2^(n-1) = 2^5 = 32`. 

Therefore, `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for the given inputs and follows the problem description. 

The function `func_1(n)` has a time complexity of O(1), as it only involves a constant number of operations, making it efficient for large inputs. 

In conclusion, the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`.
