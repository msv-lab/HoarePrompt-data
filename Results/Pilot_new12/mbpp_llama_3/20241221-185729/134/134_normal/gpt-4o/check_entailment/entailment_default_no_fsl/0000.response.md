Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the sum of even index binomial coefficients, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. This is because the binomial coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form `(1+1)^n` will have even indices that sum to 2^(n-1). The function handles this calculation correctly and returns the expected results, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for non-negative integers `n`, returning 2 raised to the power of `n-1` when `n` is greater than 0. Although the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is a negative integer, the problem description specifies that the input will be a positive integer, so this is not considered an error.

Given the problem description and the code implementation, it appears that the function is correct for all valid inputs, and the provided unit tests support this conclusion. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
