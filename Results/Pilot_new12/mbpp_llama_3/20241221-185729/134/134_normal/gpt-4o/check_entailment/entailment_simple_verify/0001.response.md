Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I have analyzed the program's correctness.

The problem description requires writing a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

The original assessment states that the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates this sum by returning `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is derived from the property that the sum of even index coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is equal to the sum of odd index coefficients, resulting in `2^n / 2 = 2^(n-1)`.

However, upon reviewing the annotated code, I noticed that it states `#State of the program right before the function call: n is a non-negative integer.` This annotation suggests that the function `func_1(n)` can handle non-negative integers, including 0, as input. But the problem description specifically asks for a positive integer `n`.

Additionally, when `n` is 0, the function returns `2 ** (0 - 1) = 2 ** -1 = 0.5`, which does not make sense in the context of summing binomial coefficients, as the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^0` is simply 1, and there are no even or odd index coefficients to sum.

Therefore, the original assessment overlooks the case where `n` might be 0, which is not a positive integer as required by the problem description. 

Considering this, I conclude that the original assessment is not accurate because it does not account for the input validation specified in the problem description (n being a positive integer).

The final answer is: Final: **False**
