To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to assess whether it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n.

The function provided, `func_1(n)`, returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. Let's examine if this calculation aligns with the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Binomial coefficients can be calculated using the formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)`, where `n` is the total number of items, `k` is the number of items to choose, and `!` denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number.

The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given `n` refers to the sum of coefficients where `k` is even, i.e., `C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) +...`.

To analyze if `2 ** (n - 1)` correctly calculates this sum, we must consider the properties of binomial coefficients and their relationship with powers of 2. 

Recall the binomial theorem: `(x + y)^n = C(n, 0)x^n + C(n, 1)x^(n-1)y + C(n, 2)x^(n-2)y^2 +... + C(n, n)y^n`. When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, this simplifies to `2^n = C(n, 0) + C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) +... + C(n, n)`, which is the sum of all binomial coefficients for a given `n`.

However, the problem specifically asks for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. There's a property that relates the sum of even indexed binomial coefficients to the sum of all coefficients: for any positive integer `n`, the sum of the binomial coefficients of even index equals the sum of the binomial coefficients of odd index, and this can be seen by considering the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n`. But, to find the sum of only the even indexed coefficients directly, we observe:

When we expand `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n`, we can derive a relationship. Specifically, considering `(1 + 1)^n = 2^n`, we can see that this expansion includes both even and odd indexed coefficients. By a similar token, `(1 - 1)^n = 0` (for `n > 0`), which can be expanded to include terms with alternating signs, leading to cancellations.

To isolate the sum of even indexed coefficients, we can exploit the relationship that `(1 + 1)^n + (1 - 1)^n = 2[C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) +...]` when considering the terms that don't cancel out. However, since `(1 - 1)^n = 0` for `n > 0`, we can't use this directly to simplify to a power of 2 as the function suggests without considering a deeper pattern or utilizing complex numbers.

In fact, using complex numbers, one can derive that the sum of the even indexed binomial coefficients is indeed `2^(n-1)` for a positive integer `n`. This comes from recognizing that in the expansion of `(1 + i)^n` (where `i` is the imaginary unit), the real part corresponds to the sum of even indexed coefficients, and through properties of complex numbers, this can simplify to `2^(n-1)` for the specific case of summing even indexed coefficients.

Given this insight and considering the constraints that `n` is a positive integer and the provided function `func_1(n) = 2 ** (n - 1)`, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**

The reason it is correct is that the formula `2 ** (n - 1)` indeed corresponds to the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`, aligning with the problem's requirement when considering deeper mathematical properties and the specific case of positive integers.
