Based on the provided information, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is mathematically equivalent to the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, as it correctly describes the function's behavior and the mathematical concept behind it. The function takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)`, which aligns with the mathematical formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The original assessment provides a clear explanation of why the function is correct, citing the mathematical property that the sum of all binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is `2^n`, and the sum of even index coefficients is equal to the sum of odd index coefficients, resulting in `2^(n-1)`.

The annotated version does mention that the function returns `0.5` when `n` is `0`, which might seem inconsistent with the problem description that asks for a positive integer `n`. However, this is not a contradiction, as the problem description does not explicitly state what should happen when `n` is `0`, and the function's behavior for `n = 0` is a mathematical consequence of the formula `2 ** (n - 1)`.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
