To assess the correctness of the given Python function `func_1(n)` in relation to the problem description, let's first understand what the problem description and the code specifications entail.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. 

### Program Specification:
The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. This function does not directly calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients but instead calculates a power of 2 based on the input `n`.

### Correctness Analysis:
Given the problem description, the task is to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. However, the provided Python function does not perform this calculation. It calculates `2` raised to the power of `(n-1)`, which does not correlate with the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The mathematical formula to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients involves combinatorial mathematics, typically summing over `\binom{n}{k}` for even `k`, where `n` is the input integer and `k` ranges from `0` to `n`. The function provided does not attempt to compute this sum.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

The reason for this conclusion is that the function `func_1(n)` does not calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients as required by the problem description. Instead, it calculates a power of 2, which serves a different purpose and does not fulfill the specified task.
