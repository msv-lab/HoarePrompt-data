The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it provides a mathematical explanation for why the function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated version, it appears that the function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is correct for the given mathematical property.

However, the annotated version states that `n` is a non-negative integer, but the problem description specifies that the input `n` should be a positive integer. This discrepancy could potentially lead to incorrect results when `n` is 0, as the program would return `0.5` in this case.

Moreover, even though the annotated version does not explicitly state that the function handles cases where `n` is not an integer or where `n` is negative, we are given the assumption that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 

Considering this assumption, and that `n` will always be a positive integer, the function will indeed return the correct sum of even index binomial coefficients. Therefore, the original assessment's conclusion that the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for the given inputs and follows the problem description is accurate.

The reason I keep the original assessment is that it correctly identifies the mathematical property used in the function and provides examples that demonstrate its correctness. The annotated version does not change the fact that the function uses this property to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Final: **True**
