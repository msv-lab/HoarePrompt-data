Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `n - 1` can be any integer greater than or equal to -1. However, when `n` is 0, `n - 1` will be -1. In Python, `2 ** -1` equals 0.5. For any other non-negative integer `n` greater than 0, `n - 1` will be a non-negative integer, and `2 ** (n - 1)` will be a power of 2.

Output State: **The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n-1), where n is a non-negative integer. When n is 0, the program returns 0.5, and for n greater than 0, the program returns a power of 2.**
