#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n-1), where n is a non-negative integer. When n is 0, the program returns 0.5, and for n greater than 0, the program returns a power of 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the power of 2. For `n` equal to 0, it returns 0.5, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of -1. For `n` greater than 0, it returns 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer, as it is not specified in the code, and it will return incorrect results for such inputs. Additionally, the function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the calculated value, without any side effects. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a value representing a power of 2, based on the input `n`, without altering any external state.
