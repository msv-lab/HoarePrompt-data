Correctness: **True**

The code provides a function `func_1` that uses list comprehension to create a new list containing the first element of each sublist in the input list `lst`. 

Given the problem description, the function seems to work correctly. It iterates over each sublist in the input list and includes the first element of each sublist in the output list, which is exactly what the problem asks for. 

The function does not handle edge cases such as empty sublists or non-list inputs. However, according to the problem description and the provided unit tests, we assume that the input will be a list of non-empty lists, which means that these edge cases are not relevant here.

Additionally, the provided output hints agree with the code's behavior. They describe how the function raises an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception when a sublist is empty, but since we assume valid inputs, this case is also not relevant. 

Therefore, given the provided descriptions and examples, it seems that the code does what the problem description says for every potential case, and hence its correctness can be considered as True.
