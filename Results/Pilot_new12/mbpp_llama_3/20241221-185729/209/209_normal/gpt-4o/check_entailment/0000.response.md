Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented to get the first element of each sublist in the given list of lists. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist, returning them as a new list.

Upon examining the function, it seems to handle various cases correctly, including:

1. Lists with sublists of varying lengths.
2. Lists with empty sublists (this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, but the function should raise an `IndexError` if an empty sublist is encountered).
3. Lists with only one sublist.
4. Empty input lists (this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, but the function should return an empty list).

The function is concise, readable, and follows best practices for Python list comprehensions. No edge cases where the function does not work as expected can be identified based on the provided description and examples.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking or handling for edge cases, such as empty sublists or non-list inputs. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, additional checks and error handling might be necessary to ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios. But based on the provided description and examples, the function seems to be correctly implemented.
