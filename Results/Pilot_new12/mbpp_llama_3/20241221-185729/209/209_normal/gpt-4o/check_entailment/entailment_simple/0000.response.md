Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in the input list and extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different scenarios:

- The first test case checks the function with sublists of varying lengths.
- The second test case checks the function with sublists of different lengths.
- The third test case checks the function with sublists containing different values.

In all cases, the function returns the expected output, which is a list containing the first element of each sublist. This confirms that the function behaves as intended and meets the requirements in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct because it always does what the problem description says for every potential case, assuming valid input.
