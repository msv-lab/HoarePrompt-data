The original assessment is **True**. The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented to get the first element of each sublist in the given list of lists. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist, returning them as a new list.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in the input list. Although the output hints mention potential edge cases such as empty sublists, non-list inputs, or sublists containing non-list or non-indexable elements, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The function does not need to handle these edge cases, as the problem description and output hints assume valid input. Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate.

The output hints also mention that the function raises an `IndexError` when encountering an empty sublist, which is consistent with the expected behavior of the function when accessing the first element of an empty list.

In conclusion, the program is correct based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints. 

Final: **True**
