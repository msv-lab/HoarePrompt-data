The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to get the first element of each sublist in a given list of lists, which it achieves through a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist and extracts the first element.

The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment by detailing the state of the program at different points, such as the input being a list of lists and the return value being a list containing the first element of each sublist. It also notes that the function does not modify the original list and does not handle edge cases like empty sublists, nested lists, or non-list inputs. However, since we assume the input will always be valid and not cause any errors, these omissions do not affect the correctness of the function regarding its primary purpose.

The key points to consider are:

1. The function correctly implements the desired functionality as described in the problem statement.
2. The assumption of valid input (i.e., a non-empty list of non-empty lists) is made, which aligns with the problem's constraints.
3. The annotations provided accurately describe the behavior and the return value of the function, reinforcing the original assessment.

Given these considerations, there is no compelling reason to alter the original assessment of the program's correctness. Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, it is reasonable to conclude that the program correctly fulfills its intended purpose as described.

Final: **True**
