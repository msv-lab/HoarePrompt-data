The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to get the first element of each sublist. Based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment. 

The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function will raise an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception if a sublist is empty, as it attempts to access the first element of the empty sublist. 

The problem description asks for a function to get the first element of each sublist, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, covering different scenarios with sublists of varying lengths.

The output hints also mention that the function does not handle any potential edge cases such as nested lists, non-list inputs, or sublists containing non-list or non-indexable elements. However, the problem description assumes that the input will be a list of lists, and the function is designed to work under this assumption. 

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
