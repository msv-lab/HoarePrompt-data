Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to get the first element of each sublist. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`. 

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios with sublists of varying lengths. 

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce incorrect results. For example, if the input list is empty, the function will correctly return an empty list. If a sublist is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior in Python when trying to access the first element of an empty list. 

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
