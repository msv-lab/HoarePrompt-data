The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to get the first element of each sublist. It also mentions that the unit tests provided support the correctness of the function and that there are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce incorrect results. 

Upon examining the annotated version of the code, it's clear that the function behaves as described. The annotation explains that the function returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to get the first element of each sublist.

The annotated version also mentions potential edge cases that the function does not handle, such as nested lists, non-list inputs, or sublists containing non-list or non-indexable elements. However, since we assume that the input to the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, these edge cases do not affect the correctness of the function with respect to the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly implements the required logic, and the unit tests support its correctness. 

Final: **True**
