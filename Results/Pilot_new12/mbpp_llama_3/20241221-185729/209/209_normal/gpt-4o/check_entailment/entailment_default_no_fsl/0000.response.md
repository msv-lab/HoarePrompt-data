Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. 

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extract the first element. This approach is both efficient and Pythonic.

The output hints suggest that the function does not handle edge cases such as nested lists, non-list inputs, or sublists containing non-list or non-indexable elements. However, the problem description does not require the function to handle these cases, and we are assuming that the input will be valid.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including lists with sublists of different lengths.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided information, the code appears to be correct and will work as expected for valid inputs.
