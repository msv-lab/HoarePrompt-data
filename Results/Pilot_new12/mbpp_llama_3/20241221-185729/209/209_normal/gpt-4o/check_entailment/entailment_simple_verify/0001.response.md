The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`. This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description to get the first element of each sublist.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, covering different scenarios with sublists of varying lengths. The function is expected to return a list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`, which is exactly what the annotated version of the code describes.

Given the assumption that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function appears to be correct. It correctly handles the requirements specified in the problem description, and the annotated version of the code provides clarity on the state of the program before the function call and the return value.

The original assessment mentions that if the input list is empty, the function will correctly return an empty list. Although this scenario is not explicitly covered by the provided unit tests, it is indeed the expected behavior. Similarly, the function's behavior when encountering an empty sublist is mentioned as raising an `IndexError`, which is consistent with Python's behavior for accessing an element in an empty list.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the annotated version, the conclusion is that the program meets the requirements.

Final: **True**
