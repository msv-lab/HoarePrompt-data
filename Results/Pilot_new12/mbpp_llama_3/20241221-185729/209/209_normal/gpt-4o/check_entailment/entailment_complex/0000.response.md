Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to get the first element of each sublist. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist (`sublist[0]`).

The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, assuming valid input (i.e., a list of non-empty lists) is provided. The function does not attempt to handle edge cases such as empty sublists, nested lists, or non-list inputs, but this is not required by the problem description.

The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. For example, `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` correctly returns `[1, 3, 6]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.

In summary, the program is correct because it implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, and its behavior is consistent with the expected output for valid input.
