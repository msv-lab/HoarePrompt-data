You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to get the first element of each sublist. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`. 

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios with sublists of varying lengths. 

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce incorrect results. For example, if the input list is empty, the function will correctly return an empty list. If a sublist is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior in Python when trying to access the first element of an empty list. 

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists `lst` as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`. If a sublist is empty, it will raise an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception because it attempts to access the first element of the empty sublist. The function does not modify the original list of lists `lst` and does not handle any potential edge cases such as nested lists, non-list inputs, or sublists containing non-list or non-indexable elements. The returned list will have the same number of elements as the number of non-empty sublists in `lst`, and each element will be the first element of the corresponding sublist in `lst`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
