Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `lst` as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`. If a sublist is empty, it will raise an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception because it attempts to access the first element of the empty sublist. The function does not modify the original list of lists `lst` and does not handle any potential edge cases such as nested lists, non-list inputs, or sublists containing non-list or non-indexable elements. The returned list will have the same number of elements as the number of non-empty sublists in `lst`, and each element will be the first element of the corresponding sublist in `lst`.**
