#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `sublists`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in the input list. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any sublist is empty, a IndexError will be raised because the code attempts to access the first element of the sublist. The function does not modify the original input list or its sublists. The returned list contains references to the original elements, not copies of them. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that might occur during execution, such as the sublists being None or not being lists.
