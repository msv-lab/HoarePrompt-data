Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If an empty sublist is encountered, the code will raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the first element of the sublist (index 0). To correctly handle this case, the code should check if a sublist is not empty before attempting to access its first element.

Here is an example of how the code can fail:
```python
sublists = [[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]
print(func_1(sublists))  # Raises IndexError
```

The correct code should be:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```
This code checks if a sublist is not empty before attempting to access its first element, thus avoiding the IndexError.
