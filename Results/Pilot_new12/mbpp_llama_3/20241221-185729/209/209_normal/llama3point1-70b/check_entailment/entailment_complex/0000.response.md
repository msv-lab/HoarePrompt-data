Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function to get the first element of each sublist. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that: it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `sublists` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist (`sublist[0]`).

The function behaves as expected for valid inputs, which is the assumption made according to the problem statement. It does not modify the original input list or its sublists and returns a list containing references to the original elements, not copies of them. 

For every potential valid case (i.e., assuming valid input is provided and the sublists are non-empty), the function will return a new list containing the first element of each sublist, which directly fulfills the requirement specified in the problem description. 

The annotated comments correctly describe the behavior of the function, indicating that it returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist and that it does not handle potential exceptions such as empty sublists or non-list inputs. However, since the problem statement assumes valid input will be provided, the lack of error handling for invalid cases does not affect the correctness of the function regarding the specified problem description.
