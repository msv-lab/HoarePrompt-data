Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle the case when a sublist is empty, in which case it will raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the first element of the sublist. According to the problem description, the function should get the first element of each sublist, but it does not specify what should happen if a sublist is empty. However, based on common conventions and the provided output hints, it can be inferred that the function should either skip empty sublists or handle them in a specific way, rather than raising an exception. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for all potential cases. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]`, the function will raise an IndexError, instead of returning `[1, 4]` or handling the empty sublist in a specified way.
