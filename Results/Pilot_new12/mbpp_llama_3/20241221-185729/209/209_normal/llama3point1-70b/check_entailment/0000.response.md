Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(sublists)` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This function uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's why the code is correct for all potential cases:

1. **Handling empty sublists**: The function will raise an `IndexError` if any of the sublists are empty, because `sublist[0]` attempts to access the first element of the sublist. However, this is the expected behavior because there is no "first element" of an empty list.

2. **Handling a list of empty lists**: The function will return an empty list if the input list contains only empty lists, because the list comprehension will not execute for any of the empty sublists. This is the correct behavior.

3. **Handling sublists of different lengths**: The function will correctly return the first element of each sublist, regardless of the length of the sublists.

4. **Handling a list of sublists containing different data types**: The function will correctly return the first element of each sublist, regardless of the data type of the elements.

Overall, the function behaves as expected and follows the problem description. It handles different edge cases correctly, and there are no obvious cases where the program does not work as expected. 

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
