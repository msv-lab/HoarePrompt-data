Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If an empty sublist is provided as input, the function will raise an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception, because it will try to access the first element of the empty sublist. 

Here's an example of an input that will cause the program to fail:
```python
sublists = [[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]
print(func_1(sublists))
```
To fix this issue, the function could be modified to handle empty sublists, for example by skipping them:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```
