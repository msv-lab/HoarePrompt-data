Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist. 

The given function `func_1(sublists)` does exactly that. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `sublists` and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist (`sublist[0]`).

For every potential case, where `sublists` is a list of non-empty lists, the function will return the correct output. For example, if `sublists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the function will return `[1, 4, 7]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.

Note that, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., `sublists` will be a list of non-empty lists), so we do not need to consider cases where `sublists` is `None`, empty, or contains empty lists. If such cases were to be considered, additional error checking would be needed to ensure the function behaves correctly. However, given the assumption of valid input, the program is correct as it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
