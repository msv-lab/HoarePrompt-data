The code provided iterates over each sublist in the `sublists` list and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. 

Given that `sublists` is a list of lists, the first element of each sublist (`sublist[0]`) can be of any type, depending on the contents of `sublists`.

Output State: **The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `sublists`.**
