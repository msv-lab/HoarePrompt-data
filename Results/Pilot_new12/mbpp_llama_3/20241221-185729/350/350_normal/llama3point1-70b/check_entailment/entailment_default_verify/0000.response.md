The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating over the array from the end to the beginning and returning the index of the target element as soon as it is found. The function also correctly handles edge cases where the target element is not present in the array, returning -1 in such cases.

The output hints provided further support the correctness of the original assessment. The hints state that the function accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and returns the last index of the `target` element in `arr` if found. If the `target` is not found, it returns -1. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the input list `arr` or the `target` element, and that it correctly handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in `arr`, and where `arr` is empty or contains only one element.

The output hints do not provide any information that contradicts the original assessment. In fact, they reinforce the idea that the function is correct and behaves as expected. Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
