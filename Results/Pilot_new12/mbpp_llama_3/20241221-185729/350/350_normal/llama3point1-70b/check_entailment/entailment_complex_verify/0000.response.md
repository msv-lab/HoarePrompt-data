The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, which is the correct approach to find the last occurrence of an element. As soon as it finds the target element, it returns its index, which is the last position of the element in the array. If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1, which is a common convention to indicate that the element is not present.

The annotated version of the code also supports the correctness of the program. The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call, and they accurately reflect the code's behavior. The function correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element, and it returns the correct last position of the target element in all cases.

One potential issue that could be raised is that the function does not explicitly check if the input array is sorted, which is a requirement stated in the problem description. However, since we assume that the input will be valid, this is not a concern.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
