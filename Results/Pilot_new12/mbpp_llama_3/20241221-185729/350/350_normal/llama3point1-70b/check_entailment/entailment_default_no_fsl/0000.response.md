Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, and as soon as it finds a match with the target element, it returns the index of that match. This approach ensures that the last occurrence of the target element is found because the function starts searching from the end of the array.

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target element is not present in the array (it returns -1), when the array is empty (it returns -1 without attempting to access any elements), and when the array contains only one element (it correctly identifies whether that single element is the target or not).

The output hints provided are consistent with the behavior of the function, detailing that it returns the last index of the target element if found or -1 if not found, and that it does not modify the input array or the target element. The hints also mention that the function handles cases where the target element is not present, the array is empty, or contains only one element, all of which the function handles correctly.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and considering the function's behavior as described, there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct for every potential case within the constraints provided.
