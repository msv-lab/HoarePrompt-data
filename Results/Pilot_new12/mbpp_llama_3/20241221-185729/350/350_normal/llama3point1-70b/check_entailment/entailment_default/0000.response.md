Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating through the array from the end to the start. The function returns the last index of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior. They mention that the function handles edge cases where the target element is not present in the array, and it also correctly handles cases where the array is empty or contains only one element.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, we don't need to worry about cases where the input is not a list or is an empty list. The code will work correctly for any valid input, as long as the input is a sorted list and the target element is a valid value.

The code's logic is straightforward and easy to follow. It iterates through the array from the end to the start, checking each element to see if it matches the target. As soon as it finds a match, it returns the index of that element. If it iterates through the entire array without finding a match, it returns -1.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It handles all potential cases and returns the expected result.
