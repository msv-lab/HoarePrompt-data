Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It iterates over the sorted array in reverse order, starting from the last element.
2. As soon as it finds the target element, it returns the index of that element.
3. If the target element is not found after iterating over the entire array, it returns -1.

This approach ensures that the function returns the last position of the target element in the sorted array, which is the requirement specified in the problem description.

Note that the function does not modify the input list `arr` or the `target` element, and its return value is an integer, which is either the last index of the `target` element in `arr` or -1 to indicate that the `target` was not found. The function handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in `arr`, and it also correctly handles cases where `arr` is empty or contains only one element.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, it is correct.
