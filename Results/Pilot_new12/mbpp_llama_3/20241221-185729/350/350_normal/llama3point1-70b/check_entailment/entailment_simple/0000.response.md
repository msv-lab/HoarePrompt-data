To determine the correctness of the given Python function `func_1` in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the function's behavior.

The problem description requires the function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function `func_1` iterates over the array in reverse order, and as soon as it finds the target element, it returns the index of that element. If the target element is not found in the array, the function returns -1, indicating that the target element was not found.

Here's why the function is correct according to the problem description:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes that the input array is sorted. Since the problem description states the same assumption, the function aligns with this requirement.

2. **Last Position of an Element**: By iterating over the array in reverse order, the function ensures that the first occurrence of the target element it encounters is the last one in the array. This directly addresses the problem description's requirement to find the last position of an element.

3. **Returns Index or -1**: If the target element is found, the function returns its index. If the target element is not found after iterating over the entire array, the function returns -1. This behavior matches the expected output based on the problem description.

4. **Assumes Valid Input**: The problem description mentions that the input will be valid (i.e., a sorted list and a target element that may or may not be in the list), which aligns with the function's assumptions about its inputs.

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description. It finds the last position of an element in a sorted array and returns -1 if the element is not found, all while assuming the input is valid as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
