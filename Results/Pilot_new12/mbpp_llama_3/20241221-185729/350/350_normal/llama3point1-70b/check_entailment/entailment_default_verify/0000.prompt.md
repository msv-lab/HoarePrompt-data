You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, which is the correct approach to find the last occurrence of an element.
2. As soon as it finds the target element, it returns its index, which is the last position of the element in the array.
3. If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1, which is a common convention to indicate that the element is not present.

This function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including:

* An empty array: The function will return -1, which is correct.
* An array with a single element: The function will return 0 if the element is the target, or -1 if it's not.
* An array with multiple elements: The function will return the correct last position of the target element.
* An array with duplicate elements: The function will return the correct last position of the target element.
* A sorted array with the target element at the beginning, middle, or end: The function will return the correct last position of the target element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I consider the code to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and returns the last index of the `target` element in `arr` if found. If the `target` is not found, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the `target` element. The function's return value is an integer, which is either the last index of the `target` element in `arr` or -1 to indicate that the `target` was not found. The function handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in `arr`, and it also correctly handles cases where `arr` is empty or contains only one element. The return postconditions in the annotations, specifically Case_2 and Case_3, do not accurately reflect the code's behavior, as the code only returns the last index of the `target` element or -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
