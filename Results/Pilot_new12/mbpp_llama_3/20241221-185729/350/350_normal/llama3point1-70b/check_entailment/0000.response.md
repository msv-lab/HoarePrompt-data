Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, which is the correct approach to find the last occurrence of an element.
2. As soon as it finds the target element, it returns its index, which is the last position of the element in the array.
3. If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1, which is a common convention to indicate that the element is not present.

This function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including:

* An empty array: The function will return -1, which is correct.
* An array with a single element: The function will return 0 if the element is the target, or -1 if it's not.
* An array with multiple elements: The function will return the correct last position of the target element.
* An array with duplicate elements: The function will return the correct last position of the target element.
* A sorted array with the target element at the beginning, middle, or end: The function will return the correct last position of the target element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I consider the code to be correct.
