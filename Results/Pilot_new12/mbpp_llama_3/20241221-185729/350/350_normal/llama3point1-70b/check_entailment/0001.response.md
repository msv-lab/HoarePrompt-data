Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function is correct for finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

- The function iterates over the array from the end to the start (`range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`), which allows it to find the last occurrence of the target element in the sorted array.
- It checks each element for equality with the target (`arr[i] == target`), and returns the index (`i`) as soon as it finds a match.
- If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target element is not present in the array.

This approach works because the array is sorted, ensuring that all occurrences of a particular element are contiguous and maintaining the order of elements allows the function to stop searching as soon as it finds the last occurrence of the target from the end.

Given the function is designed to work with sorted arrays and it correctly handles the case where the target element is not found, it should work for all potential cases as described. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause this function to fail according to the problem description.
