Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, and `i` is the last index of `arr` that was not checked in the previous iteration. If `arr[i]` equals `target`, the program returns `i`, which is at least 0. Otherwise, no explicit action is taken.***
