The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`. After executing the function body, 
Case_1: the function returns the last index of the sorted list `arr` at which the `target` is found.
Case_2: the function returns the second last index of the sorted list `arr`.
Case_3: the function returns `i`, which is the last index of the sorted list `arr` that was not checked in the previous iteration.
Case_4: the function returns -1, indicating that the target element was not found in the sorted list `arr`. 
Note that if one case is fulfilled, none of the other cases will be executed.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `arr` and a target element, and return the last index of the target element if found, or specific indices under certain conditions, or -1 if the target is not found.
