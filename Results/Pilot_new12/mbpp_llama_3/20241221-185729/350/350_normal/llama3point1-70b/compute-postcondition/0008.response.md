The variable `i` is the last index of `arr` that was not checked in the previous iteration. Since `arr` has at least 2 elements, the second last index is at least 1. Given that `i` is one less than the second last index of `arr`, `i` is at least 0 and is an index in the list `arr`. 
Output State: **The program returns i, which is the last index of the sorted list `arr` that was not checked in the previous iteration, where `arr` has at least 2 elements and i is at least 0**
