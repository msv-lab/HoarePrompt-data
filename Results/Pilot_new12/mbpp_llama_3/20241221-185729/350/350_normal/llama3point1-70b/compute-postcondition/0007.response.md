According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again, but since the loop is iterating in reverse order, `i` needs to be greater than or equal to -1 and less than the current value. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second last index of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be one less than the current second last index.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, and `i` is the last index of `arr` that was not checked in the previous iteration, so `i` is one less than the second last index of `arr`**
