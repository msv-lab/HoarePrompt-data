Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, and `i` is the second last index of `arr`. If the element at the second last index `i` of `arr` is equal to `target`, the program returns the second last index of `arr`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the postcondition is not explicitly defined for this case, as there is no else part in the code.***
