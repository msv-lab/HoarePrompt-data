The given code `return -1` indicates that the function ends with an explicit return value of -1. This suggests that the `target` element was not found in the `arr` list, as the return value of -1 is often used to signify "not found" in search operations.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, we understand that `arr` is a sorted list, but the specific elements it contains are not specified. The `target` could be any element that may or may not be in `arr`. However, since the function returns -1, it implies the `target` was not located within `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the target element was not found in the sorted list arr.**
