To determine the output state, we need to understand what the variable `i` represents and its value based on the initial state.

Given that `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements and `i` is the second last index of `arr`, we can determine the value of `i` by considering the indexing of lists in Python. In Python, list indices start at 0. Therefore, the last index of a list is always one less than the length of the list. The second last index would then be two less than the length of the list.

If we denote the length of `arr` as `len(arr)`, then the last index is `len(arr) - 1`, and the second last index `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

Since `arr` must have at least 2 elements, the minimum value for `len(arr)` is 2, making the minimum value for `i` as 0 (when `len(arr)` is 2). However, `i` can be any integer greater than or equal to 0, depending on the length of `arr`.

The value of `target` does not affect the determination of `i` since `i` is solely based on the indexing of `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the second last index of the sorted list `arr`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0, representing the index of the second to last element in `arr`.**
