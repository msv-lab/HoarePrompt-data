According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index of `arr`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1 because the loop iterates in reverse order. 

Given that `i` is the last index of `arr` at the end of the last iteration, decreasing `i` by 1 would make it the second last index of `arr`. Since `arr` must have at least 1 element and we have already checked the last element, `arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, `i` is the second last index of `arr`**
