The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and returns the last index of the `target` element in `arr` if found. If the `target` is not found, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the `target` element. The function's return value is an integer, which is either the last index of the `target` element in `arr` or -1 to indicate that the `target` was not found. The function handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in `arr`, and it also correctly handles cases where `arr` is empty or contains only one element. The return postconditions in the annotations, specifically Case_2 and Case_3, do not accurately reflect the code's behavior, as the code only returns the last index of the `target` element or -1.
