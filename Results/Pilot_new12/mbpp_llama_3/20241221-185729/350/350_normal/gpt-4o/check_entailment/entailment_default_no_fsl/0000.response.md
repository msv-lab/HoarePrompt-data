Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code defines a function `func_1` that correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why the code works as expected:

1. **Reverse Iteration**: The function iterates over the input array in reverse order, starting from the last index. This approach ensures that if the target element appears multiple times in the array, the function will find the last occurrence.

2. **Immediate Return**: Once the target element is found, the function immediately returns its index. This is efficient and aligns with the requirement to find the last position, as it does not continue searching after finding the first occurrence from the end.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases where the array is empty, contains a single element, or has multiple elements. If the target element is not found in the array, the function returns -1, indicating that the element is not present.

4. **Sorted Array Assumption**: Since the problem states that the input array is sorted, and we assume the input will always be valid, we don't need to verify if the array is indeed sorted. The function's logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array is sound under this assumption.

5. **Return Values**: The function's return values are consistent with the problem description. It either returns the index of the target element if found or -1 if the element is not present in the array. 

6. **Assumptions on Input Validity**: Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program (e.g., the input is a non-empty list, elements are comparable), the function operates within these bounds and does not need to handle invalid inputs like `None` or `NaN` values.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, the function behaves as expected for all potential valid inputs, making the code correct for its intended purpose.
