Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates through the input sorted array `arr` in reverse order to find the last position of an element `x`. The function immediately returns the index of `x` if found and returns -1 if the loop completes without finding `x`. 

The code correctly handles various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with one element, or a list with multiple elements. It also correctly returns the last index of `x` if there are multiple occurrences of `x` in the sorted array.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function by checking its output for different input scenarios. The function passes all these tests, demonstrating its ability to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

Additionally, the output hints agree with the code, explaining that the function returns the index of `x` if found and -1 if not found, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem description. 

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases, assuming valid input.
