Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. 

The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that. It iterates through the sorted array in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element `x` it encounters, which is the last position of `x` in the array. If `x` is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates through the array in reverse order using `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`. This ensures that it finds the last occurrence of `x` first.

2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is equal to `x` using `if arr[i] == x`. If this condition is true, it returns the index `i` immediately.

3. If the loop completes without finding `x`, the function returns -1, indicating that `x` is not present in the array.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves correctly:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` returns 0, which is the last (and only) position of 1 in the array.
- `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` returns 2, which is the last position of 1 in the array.
- `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` returns 3, which is the last position of 3 in the array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array, as specified in the problem description.
