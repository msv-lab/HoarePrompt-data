Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating through the array in reverse order. 

Here's why it always meets the problem description:

1. **Reverse iteration**: The program iterates through the array in reverse order using a for loop with `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`. This ensures that the last occurrence of the target element `x` is found.

2. **Immediate return**: When the target element `x` is found, the function immediately returns its index `i`. This ensures that the last index of `x` is returned.

3. **Handling edge cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list `arr` and a list with one element. If `x` is not found in any of these cases, the function returns -1, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`.

4. **Return values**: The function's return values are limited to the index of `x` if found or -1 if not found, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

5. **No modification of input**: The function does not modify the input list or element, which is consistent with the problem description.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0`, `assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2`, and `assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3`, demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input scenarios.

In conclusion, the program implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly, making it a correct solution.
