Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a sorted array `arr` and an element `x` as input and returns the last position of `x` in the array. If `x` is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

The function iterates over the array from right to left (i.e., from the last element to the first element) and checks if the current element is equal to `x`. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index of that element, which is the last position of `x` in the array because the function is searching from right to left.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various cases, including when the element is present multiple times in the array and when it is present at the beginning or end of the array.

After examining the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles the edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with duplicate elements, and returns the correct result.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
