Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element it encounters, which is the last occurrence in the original array due to the reverse iteration.

This function works correctly because it starts from the end of the array and moves towards the beginning. As soon as it finds the target element `x`, it returns the index of that element. Since the array is sorted, if there are multiple occurrences of the target element, iterating from the end ensures that the function returns the last index of these occurrences.

For example, given the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and the target element `1`, the function correctly returns `2`, which is the last index of `1` in the array.

The function also handles cases where the target element is not found in the array by returning `-1`.

The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including arrays with single and multiple occurrences of the target element. Without any evidence of incorrect behavior for any potential case, the program is considered correct.
