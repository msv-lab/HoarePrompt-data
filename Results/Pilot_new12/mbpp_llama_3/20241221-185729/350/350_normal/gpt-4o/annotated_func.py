#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of elements, and x is an element that may or may not be present in arr.
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` remains a sorted list of elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and if `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns its index; otherwise, if the loop completes without finding `x`, the function implicitly ends without an explicit return value, leaving `arr` and `x` unchanged from their original state except for the loop's internal iterations.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating `x` is not found in `arr`, and `arr` remains a sorted list with `x` being the element that was searched for
#Overall this is what the function does:The function searches for an element `x` in a sorted list `arr` and returns the index of `x` if found, otherwise returns -1. The function iterates through `arr` in reverse order, allowing it to return the last index of `x` if there are multiple occurrences. The state of `arr` and `x` remains unchanged after the function call, as the function does not modify the input list or element. If `x` is found, the function will immediately return its index. If the loop completes without finding `x`, the function returns -1, indicating `x` is not present in `arr`. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list `arr`, a list with one element, or a list with multiple elements, and it correctly returns -1 if `x` is not found in any of these cases. The function's return values are limited to the index of `x` if found or -1 if not found, with no specific handling for other potential edge cases such as `None` or `NaN` values in `arr` or `x`.
