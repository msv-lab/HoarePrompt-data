The function searches for an element `x` in a sorted list `arr` and returns the index of `x` if found, otherwise returns -1. The function iterates through `arr` in reverse order, allowing it to return the last index of `x` if there are multiple occurrences. The state of `arr` and `x` remains unchanged after the function call, as the function does not modify the input list or element. If `x` is found, the function will immediately return its index. If the loop completes without finding `x`, the function returns -1, indicating `x` is not present in `arr`. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list `arr`, a list with one element, or a list with multiple elements, and it correctly returns -1 if `x` is not found in any of these cases. The function's return values are limited to the index of `x` if found or -1 if not found, with no specific handling for other potential edge cases such as `None` or `NaN` values in `arr` or `x`.
