According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the loop counter `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second last index of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 2 elements and `i` is the second last index, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than the last index of `arr`. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes the third last index of `arr` if it exists, otherwise it becomes -1 and the loop ends. Since the list `arr` must have at least 2 elements for the second last index to exist and for the loop to have executed at least once, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements for the third last index to exist and for `i` to be a valid index.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, `i` is the third last index of `arr` if it exists, otherwise the loop ends**
