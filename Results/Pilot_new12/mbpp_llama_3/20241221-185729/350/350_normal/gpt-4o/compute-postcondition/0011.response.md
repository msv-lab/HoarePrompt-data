Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, the impact of the code is that it returns -1, indicating that the element `x` was not found in the sorted list `arr`. The variables `arr` and `x` remain unchanged from their original state, with `arr` still being a sorted list of elements and `x` being an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. 

Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating `x` is not found in `arr`, and `arr` remains a sorted list with `x` being the element that was searched for**
