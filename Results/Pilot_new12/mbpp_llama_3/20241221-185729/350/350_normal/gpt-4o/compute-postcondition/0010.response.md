To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop code.

The loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, checking each element to see if it matches `x`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of that element.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, it's clear that:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must have at least one element.
- The loop checks elements from the end of the list towards the beginning.
- If `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `x` as soon as it encounters a match, which means the loop does not complete all iterations if `x` is found.

Given this behavior, after all iterations of the loop have finished (or not finished because `x` was found), the following conditions are true:
- If `x` is found in `arr`, the function will have returned the index of `x`, and the loop will not have completed all iterations. In this case, the state of the variables is not as relevant because the function has already terminated.
- If `x` is not found in `arr`, the loop will have checked every element in `arr` without finding a match. In this scenario, `i` will be set to `-1` because the loop iterates until `i` reaches `-1`, which is the condition for the loop to stop.

However, the key point here is that the loop's primary purpose is to find `x` in `arr` and return its index if found. If `x` is not found, the loop completes without explicitly returning a value or modifying the external state of `arr` or `x` beyond what's done within the loop iterations.

Considering the original task and the format required for the answer, let's summarize the output state:

Output State: **`arr` remains a sorted list of elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and if `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns its index; otherwise, if the loop completes without finding `x`, the function implicitly ends without an explicit return value, leaving `arr` and `x` unchanged from their original state except for the loop's internal iterations.**
