To determine the output state, we need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state describes `arr` as a sorted list with at least 3 elements, `x` as an element that may or may not be in `arr`, and `i` as the third last index of `arr` if it exists.

Given that `arr` has at least 3 elements and is sorted, we can infer that the list has a defined order, but the specific elements and their values are not specified. The variable `x` could be any element, and its presence in `arr` is not guaranteed. The variable `i` is defined as the third last index of `arr`, which implies that if `arr` has `n` elements, `i` would be `n-3` (since indexing starts at 0).

The code snippet simply returns `i`, which is the third last index of `arr`. 

Therefore, considering the information provided and the return statement, the output state is directly related to the value of `i`, which is determined by the length of `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the third last index of the sorted list 'arr', which is a list with at least 3 elements.**
