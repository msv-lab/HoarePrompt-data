The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns one of the following values based on the specified cases: 
1. The last index of the sorted list `arr` which is the index of the element `x`, 
2. The second last index of the sorted list `arr`, 
3. The third last index of the sorted list `arr`, or 
4. -1, indicating `x` is not found in `arr`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and return an index based on the specified conditions, or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and returns the index of `x` if found, or specific indices based on the list length, or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`.**
