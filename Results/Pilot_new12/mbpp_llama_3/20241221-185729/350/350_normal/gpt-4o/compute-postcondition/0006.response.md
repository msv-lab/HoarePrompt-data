Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. If the second last element of `arr` is equal to `x`, the program returns the second last index of `arr`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
