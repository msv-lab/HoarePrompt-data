To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

- `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements.
- `x` is an element that may or may not be in `arr`, but its presence or absence does not affect the outcome of the code snippet provided.
- `i` is set to the second last index of `arr`. Given that Python uses zero-based indexing, the second last index of a list can be found using `len(arr) - 2`, where `len(arr)` gives the total number of elements in the list.

The code snippet simply returns `i`, which is the second last index of `arr`. 

Since `arr` has at least 2 elements, the second last index (`i`) will always be an integer greater than or equal to 0 (because the first index in a list is 0) and less than the last index of the list.

Output State: **The program returns the second last index of the sorted list `arr`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the last index of `arr`.**
