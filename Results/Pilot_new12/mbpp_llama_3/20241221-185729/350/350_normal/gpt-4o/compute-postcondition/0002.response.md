The last index of `arr` is stored in `i`, and the value of `arr` at this index is equal to the value of `x`. Since `arr` is a sorted list with at least 1 element and the last element of `arr` is `x`, `i` will be the last index of `arr` which is holding the value `x`.

Output State: **The program returns the last index of the sorted list 'arr' which is the index of the element 'x'**
