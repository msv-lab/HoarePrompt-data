Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord` function. This function works as expected for all single-character inputs, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The `ord` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value. Since the problem description only asks for the ASCII value of a character, and given that the examples provided in the assertions cover different types of characters, it is reasonable to conclude that this function will work correctly for any single character input.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to misbehave or not follow the problem description. The function does exactly what it's supposed to do: it takes a character and returns its ASCII value. Therefore, without being able to find a case where the function does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
