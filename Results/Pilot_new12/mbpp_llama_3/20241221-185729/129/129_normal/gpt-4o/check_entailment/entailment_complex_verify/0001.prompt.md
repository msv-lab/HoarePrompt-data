You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord` function. This function works as expected for all single-character inputs, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The `ord` function in Python returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value. Since the problem description only asks for the ASCII value of a character, and given that the examples provided in the assertions cover different types of characters, it is reasonable to conclude that this function will work correctly for any single character input.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to misbehave or not follow the problem description. The function does exactly what it's supposed to do: it takes a character and returns its ASCII value. Therefore, without being able to find a case where the function does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its Unicode point. If the input is not a string or is a string of length other than 1, the function will throw an error. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases. It assumes that the input will always be a single character string. The state of the program after the function concludes will be that the Unicode point of the input character is returned, but any side effects or modifications to external state are not anticipated or performed by this function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
