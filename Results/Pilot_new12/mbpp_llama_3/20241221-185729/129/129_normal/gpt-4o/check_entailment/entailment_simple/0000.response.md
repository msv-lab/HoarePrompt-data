Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the ASCII value of a character, and it does so by using the built-in Python function `ord()`, which returns the Unicode point of a single character string. In the case of ASCII characters, the Unicode point is equivalent to the ASCII value.

The program's correctness can be verified by the provided unit tests, which demonstrate that the function returns the expected ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., a single character string), the function will always return the correct ASCII value.

It's worth noting that the problem description specifically asks for the ASCII value, and since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, the `ord()` function is sufficient to meet this requirement. Therefore, the program is correct and always meets the requirements of the problem description.
