Correctness: **False**.

The code seems to be incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the ASCII value of a character, but the code returns the Unicode point of the character, which is not the same as the ASCII value for non-ASCII characters. The function `ord()` in Python returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string, which is not equivalent to the ASCII value for characters outside the ASCII range (0-127).

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string. If the input is a string with a length other than 1, the function will still return a value, but it will be the Unicode point of the first character in the string, which is not the expected behavior.

However, in this specific case, since we are assuming that the input will always be a single character string and that the character is an ASCII character (as hinted by the example assertions), the code will work as expected. But, if we consider the possibility of non-ASCII characters or strings with a length other than 1, the code does not follow the problem description. 

But, the description says to assume the input will be valid so we should not consider the case of non single character strings. However, the problem description says the function should return the ascii value, and the code does not guarantee to return the ascii value since it returns the unicode point, and for characters outside the ascii range, these values are not the same.
