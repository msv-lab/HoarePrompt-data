The original assessment of the program concludes that the correctness is **True**. Upon reviewing the problem description, the program, and the annotated version, it appears that this assessment remains accurate.

The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord` function to calculate this value, which indeed returns the Unicode point for a given character. Since ASCII characters are a subset of Unicode and have corresponding Unicode points that match their ASCII values, the `ord` function correctly returns the ASCII value for any single ASCII character input.

The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion. Before calling `func_1`, the state of the program indicates that `char` is a single character string, and the function returns the Unicode point of this character, which is equivalent to its ASCII value for ASCII characters.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid and the program does not need to handle cases where the input might not be a single character, the function behaves as expected. It correctly returns the ASCII value for the provided single character inputs, as demonstrated by the assertions.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the problem description, the original assessment that the program's correctness is **True** is maintained. The function works correctly for its intended purpose under the assumption of valid input.

Final: **True**
