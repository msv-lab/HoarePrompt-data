You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord` function in Python, which returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, `ord` correctly returns the ASCII value for ASCII characters.

The function does not have any explicit error handling for non-character inputs or non-ASCII characters. However, the problem description does not specify the expected behavior for these cases. 

If we assume that the input will always be a single ASCII character, then the function works correctly for all possible inputs. The unit tests provided in the problem description also support this assumption.

It's worth noting that if the input can be a non-ASCII character or a non-character type, the function may not behave as expected. For example, if the input is a string of length greater than 1, or if the input is a non-string type, the function may raise an exception or return an unexpected result. But based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, these cases are not considered. 

Therefore, under the assumption that the input will always be a single ASCII character, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its Unicode point. If the input is not a string or is a string of length other than 1, the function will throw an error. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases. It assumes that the input will always be a single character string. The state of the program after the function concludes will be that the Unicode point of the input character is returned, but any side effects or modifications to external state are not anticipated or performed by this function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
