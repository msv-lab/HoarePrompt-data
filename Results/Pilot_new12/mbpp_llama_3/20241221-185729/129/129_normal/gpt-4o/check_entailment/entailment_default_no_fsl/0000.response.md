Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Although the program does find the ASCII value of a character, which is equivalent to its Unicode point for ASCII characters, the code does not include error checking to handle cases when the input is not a single character string.

For instance, if the input to the function `func_1` is not a string (e.g., `func_1(123)`), or if it's a string with more or less than one character (e.g., `func_1('ab')` or `func_1('')`), the function will throw an error because it does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases.

However, considering the assumption that the input will always be valid (a single character string), the function as provided does meet the basic requirement of finding the ASCII value of a character. But given the strict definition that the program must work for every potential case as described, including handling potential errors or invalid inputs, the code is technically incorrect in its current form due to the lack of input validation.

To make the program fully correct as per the problem description and including robust error handling, modifications would be needed, such as adding checks to ensure the input is a string and has a length of 1, and handling cases where these conditions are not met appropriately.
