Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The provided function, `func_1`, uses the built-in `ord` function in Python to return the Unicode point of the input character, which is equivalent to the ASCII value for characters in the ASCII range.

Since we assume that the input will always be a valid single character string, the function will always return the correct ASCII value without any errors. The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, and `assert func_1('S') == 83`, demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

It is worth noting that the function returns the Unicode point, which is a more general concept that includes ASCII values. However, for characters in the ASCII range, the Unicode point and the ASCII value are equivalent, so the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
