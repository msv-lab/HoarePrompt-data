Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord` function in Python, which returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, `ord` correctly returns the ASCII value for ASCII characters.

The function does not have any explicit error handling for non-character inputs or non-ASCII characters. However, the problem description does not specify the expected behavior for these cases. 

If we assume that the input will always be a single ASCII character, then the function works correctly for all possible inputs. The unit tests provided in the problem description also support this assumption.

It's worth noting that if the input can be a non-ASCII character or a non-character type, the function may not behave as expected. For example, if the input is a string of length greater than 1, or if the input is a non-string type, the function may raise an exception or return an unexpected result. But based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, these cases are not considered. 

Therefore, under the assumption that the input will always be a single ASCII character, the function is correct.
