The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its Unicode point. If the input is not a string or is a string of length other than 1, the function will throw an error. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases. It assumes that the input will always be a single character string. The state of the program after the function concludes will be that the Unicode point of the input character is returned, but any side effects or modifications to external state are not anticipated or performed by this function.
