#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns an integer representing the Unicode of the character stored in 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character as a string and returns its Unicode value as an integer. It does not perform any error checking, so if a string of length other than 1 is passed, it will still return the Unicode value of the first character. If a non-string input is passed, the function will throw an error. The function does not modify the input string or have any side effects, and its return value can be used for further processing or stored in a variable. The function's behavior is determined solely by the input character's Unicode value, which is returned unchanged.
