You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. This function works correctly for all single characters, including letters, digits, and special characters.

The function is well-documented with clear parameters and return types, making it easy to understand and use. The input parameter `char` is expected to be a string of length 1, and the function returns an integer representing the ASCII value of the character.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can consider various test cases:

1. Single letters: `func_1('a')` returns `97`, which is the correct ASCII value of 'a'.
2. Single digits: `func_1('5')` returns `53`, which is the correct ASCII value of '5'.
3. Special characters: `func_1('@')` returns `64`, which is the correct ASCII value of '@'.
4. Non-ASCII characters: Although the function does not explicitly handle non-ASCII characters, the `ord` function in Python can handle Unicode characters, returning their Unicode code points.

However, one potential edge case to consider is when the input string is empty or has a length greater than 1. In these cases, the function may not behave as expected. For example:
- `func_1('')` raises a `TypeError`, because the `ord` function expects a single character.
- `func_1('ab')` raises a `TypeError`, for the same reason.

To make the function more robust, it could include error checking to handle these edge cases. Nevertheless, assuming the input is always a single character, the function works correctly.

In summary, the program is correct for its intended purpose, but it may benefit from additional error handling for edge cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single character as a string and returns its Unicode value as an integer. It does not perform any error checking, so if a string of length other than 1 is passed, it will still return the Unicode value of the first character. If a non-string input is passed, the function will throw an error. The function does not modify the input string or have any side effects, and its return value can be used for further processing or stored in a variable. The function's behavior is determined solely by the input character's Unicode value, which is returned unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
