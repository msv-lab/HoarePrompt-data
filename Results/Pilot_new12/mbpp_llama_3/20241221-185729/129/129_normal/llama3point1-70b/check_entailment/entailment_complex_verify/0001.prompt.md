You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Single characters: The function works as expected with single characters, such as 'a', 'A', '0', etc.
- ASCII characters: The function correctly returns the ASCII values for all printable ASCII characters (space to tilde).
- Non-printable ASCII characters: Although not explicitly mentioned, the function also works with non-printable ASCII characters (e.g., '\n', '\t', etc.).

There are no edge cases that the code does not handle, and it does not contain any missing logic. The function is well-documented with clear parameters and return type descriptions. 

In summary, the program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a given character, and it handles all potential cases as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a string of length 1, i.e., a single character.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns an integer representing the Unicode of the character stored in 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character as a string and returns its Unicode value as an integer. It does not perform any error checking, so if a string of length other than 1 is passed, it will still return the Unicode value of the first character. If a non-string input is passed, the function will throw an error. The function does not modify the input string or have any side effects, and its return value can be used for further processing or stored in a variable. The function's behavior is determined solely by the input character's Unicode value, which is returned unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
