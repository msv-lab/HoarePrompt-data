Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that. It uses the built-in `ord` function to return the Unicode value of the input character, which for ASCII characters is equivalent to their ASCII value.

The function is designed to take a single character as a string and return its Unicode value as an integer, which aligns with the problem description. Although the function does not perform error checking, the problem description and the instructions specify that we assume the input will be valid, meaning that the input will always be a single character.

Therefore, under the assumption that the input is always valid (a single character), the function behaves as expected and returns the ASCII value of the input character, fulfilling the requirements specified in the problem description.
