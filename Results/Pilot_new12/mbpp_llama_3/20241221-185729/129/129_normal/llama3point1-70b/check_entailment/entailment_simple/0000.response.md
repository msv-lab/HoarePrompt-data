To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's first clarify the requirements and the program's behavior.

The problem description requires writing a function to find the ASCII value of a character. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers. Each character in the ASCII table has a unique numerical value known as its ASCII value.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in Python function `ord()`. The `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character, which for characters in the ASCII range (0-127) corresponds directly to their ASCII values.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (in this case, a single character), let's evaluate the program's correctness:

- The function `func_1` is designed to accept a single character (`char`) and return its corresponding ASCII value.
- The use of `ord(char)` correctly returns the Unicode code point for the given character, which, as mentioned, directly corresponds to the ASCII value for characters within the ASCII range.
- The function does not handle cases where the input might not be a single character or might be outside the ASCII range because the problem statement and the assumption of valid input exempt it from doing so.
- Since Python's `ord()` function works with Unicode and all ASCII characters have a direct mapping in Unicode, using `ord()` to find the ASCII value of a character within the ASCII range is a correct approach.

Based on these observations, it's clear that the program does exactly what the problem description asks for within the constraints provided (i.e., assuming valid input of a single ASCII character).

Correctness: **True**
