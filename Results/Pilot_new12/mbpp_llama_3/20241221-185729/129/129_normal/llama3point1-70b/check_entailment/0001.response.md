Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Single characters: The function works as expected with single characters, such as 'a', 'A', '0', etc.
- ASCII characters: The function correctly returns the ASCII values for all printable ASCII characters (space to tilde).
- Non-printable ASCII characters: Although not explicitly mentioned, the function also works with non-printable ASCII characters (e.g., '\n', '\t', etc.).

There are no edge cases that the code does not handle, and it does not contain any missing logic. The function is well-documented with clear parameters and return type descriptions. 

In summary, the program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a given character, and it handles all potential cases as expected.
