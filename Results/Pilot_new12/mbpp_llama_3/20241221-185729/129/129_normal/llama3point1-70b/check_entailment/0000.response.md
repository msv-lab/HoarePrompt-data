Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function in Python. This function works correctly for all single characters, including letters, digits, and special characters.

The function is well-documented with clear parameters and return types, making it easy to understand and use. The input parameter `char` is expected to be a string of length 1, and the function returns an integer representing the ASCII value of the character.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can consider various test cases:

1. Single letters: `func_1('a')` returns `97`, which is the correct ASCII value of 'a'.
2. Single digits: `func_1('5')` returns `53`, which is the correct ASCII value of '5'.
3. Special characters: `func_1('@')` returns `64`, which is the correct ASCII value of '@'.
4. Non-ASCII characters: Although the function does not explicitly handle non-ASCII characters, the `ord` function in Python can handle Unicode characters, returning their Unicode code points.

However, one potential edge case to consider is when the input string is empty or has a length greater than 1. In these cases, the function may not behave as expected. For example:
- `func_1('')` raises a `TypeError`, because the `ord` function expects a single character.
- `func_1('ab')` raises a `TypeError`, for the same reason.

To make the function more robust, it could include error checking to handle these edge cases. Nevertheless, assuming the input is always a single character, the function works correctly.

In summary, the program is correct for its intended purpose, but it may benefit from additional error handling for edge cases.
