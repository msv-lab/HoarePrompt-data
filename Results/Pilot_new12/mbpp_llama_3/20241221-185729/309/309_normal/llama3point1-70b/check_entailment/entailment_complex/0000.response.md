The provided Python function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all characters in the string are the same. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function uses the `set(s)` function to create a set of unique characters in the string `s`. 
2. The `len(set(s)) == 1` expression checks if the length of this set is equal to 1, which means all characters in the string are the same.
3. If the length of the set is 1, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the problem description, this function is correct because it properly handles all potential cases, including:
- Empty strings: `set('')` returns an empty set, and `len(set('')) == 1` returns `False`, as expected.
- Strings with multiple unique characters: `set('abc')` returns a set with multiple characters, and `len(set('abc')) == 1` returns `False`.
- Strings with a single unique character: `set('aaa')` returns a set with one character, and `len(set('aaa')) == 1` returns `True`.

Therefore, the function `func_1(s)` correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
