Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in a string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set()` function to remove duplicate characters from the string. If all characters are the same, the length of the set will be 1, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

- It correctly identifies strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaa", "bbb", etc.) and returns `True`.
- It correctly identifies strings with at least two different characters (e.g., "ab", "abc", etc.) and returns `False`.
- The function works for strings of any length, including empty strings, in which case `set(s)` would be an empty set and `len(set(s))` would be 0, correctly returning `False` because an empty string does not contain "all the same characters" in the context of the problem description.
- The use of `set(s)` effectively handles strings with any number of unique characters, making it a robust solution for this specific problem.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input (i.e., a non-empty string).
