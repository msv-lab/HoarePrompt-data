Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all the characters in the given string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set` data structure to achieve this. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. So, when a string is converted to a set, it removes all duplicate characters.

The function `func_1(s)` returns `True` if the length of the set is 1, meaning all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise.

Here's why this program works correctly for every potential case:

- If the string is empty, `len(set(s))` will be 0, and the function will correctly return `False`, because an empty string does not contain all the same characters (there are no characters).
- If the string contains a single character, `len(set(s))` will be 1, and the function will correctly return `True`, because a string with a single character contains all the same characters.
- If the string contains multiple characters, `len(set(s))` will be greater than 1 if there are different characters, and the function will correctly return `False`. If all characters are the same, `len(set(s))` will be 1, and the function will correctly return `True`.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, so the program is correct.
