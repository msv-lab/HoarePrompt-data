Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same or not. It uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate characters. If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one unique character, and its length will be 1. The function correctly returns `True` if all characters are the same and `False` otherwise.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty strings: Although not explicitly stated in the problem description, this function will return `True` for an empty string because the length of a set created from an empty string is 0, not 1, indicating the function actually handles this edge case by returning `False` when the string is empty, since `len(set(s)) == 1` will be `False`.
- Single-character strings: Returns `True`.
- Strings with all characters the same: Returns `True`.
- Strings with different characters: Returns `False`.

It's a concise and efficient solution, and based on the provided problem description, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
