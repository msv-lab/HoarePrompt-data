#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns Boolean value True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting entirely of the same character, which is `first_char`, `first_char` is the first (and every) character of `s`, `char` equals `first_char` if the loop completes without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the input string `s` consists entirely of the same character. It returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with a single character, and a string with multiple characters. If the string is empty, the function immediately returns `True`. If the string is not empty, the function iterates over each character in the string, checking if it matches the first character. If a mismatch is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string consists entirely of the same character. The function's return value is a Boolean that reflects the result of this check.
