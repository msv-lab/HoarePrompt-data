To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `s` is a string.
- `s` is not empty.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`, i.e., `first_char` is equal to `s[0]`.

Loop Statement:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Since `s` is not empty and the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the loop will execute at least once. The initial state of `char` should be the first character of `s`, which is already given as `first_char`. Thus, for the loop to start executing, the state adjustments should reflect that `char` is now the first character of `s` (which is the same as `first_char`), and the index or position in the string from where the loop starts is at the beginning of the string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s` (i.e., `char` equals `first_char`)**
