The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. Since `s` is a string and is not empty, `s[0]` will be the first character of the string. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, i.e., `first_char` is equal to `s[0]`.**
