You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if the input string `s` consists entirely of the same character. It returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with a single character, and a string with multiple characters. If the string is empty, the function immediately returns `True`. If the string is not empty, the function iterates over each character in the string, checking if it matches the first character. If a mismatch is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string consists entirely of the same character. The function's return value is a Boolean that reflects the result of this check.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
