Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the problem description, which is to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function `func_1` correctly handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with a single character, and a string with multiple characters. The function immediately returns `True` if the string is empty, which aligns with the problem description's interpretation of "all characters being the same" in the context of an empty string. When the string is not empty, the function iterates over each character in the string, checking if it matches the first character. If a mismatch is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are indeed the same. This logic is consistent with the output hints provided, which describe the function's behavior in a manner that matches its implementation. Given the assertions provided and the analysis of the function's logic, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description for every potential case, without any omissions or incorrect assumptions about the input or the behavior for edge cases.
