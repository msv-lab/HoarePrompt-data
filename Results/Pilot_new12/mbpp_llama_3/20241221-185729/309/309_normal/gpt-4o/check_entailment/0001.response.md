Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether all the characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. It correctly handles the edge case where the string is empty, in which case it returns `True`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. It first checks if the string is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because there are no characters to compare, implying that all characters (none, in this case) are the same.

2. If the string is not empty, it stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.

3. The function then iterates over each character in the string. If it finds a character that is different from `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters in the string are the same.

4. If the function iterates over the entire string without finding any characters that are different from `first_char`, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

The function handles all possible cases, including empty strings, strings with one character, and strings with multiple characters. It also correctly returns the expected result for these cases, which is why its correctness is **True**.
