Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. The function iterates over each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If it encounters a character that is different from the first character, it immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any different characters, it returns `True`. 

The function also correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty, in which case it returns `True`. 

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's behavior for different inputs. 

After analyzing the code, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct. 

However, it's worth noting that a more concise and efficient way to implement this function would be to use Python's built-in `set` data structure, like this:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) <= 1
```
This function works by converting the string into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. If the length of the set is less than or equal to 1, that means all characters in the string are the same.
