Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. It checks whether all characters in the input string are the same or not.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It first checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, the program returns `True`, which is correct because an empty string can be considered as a string with all characters being the same (i.e., there are no characters to compare).

2. If the string is not empty, it stores the first character of the string in the variable `first_char`.

3. It then iterates over each character in the string. If it finds a character that is not equal to `first_char`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters in the string are the same.

4. If the loop completes without finding any character that is not equal to `first_char`, it means that all characters in the string are the same, so the program returns `True`.

The program handles all potential cases:

- Empty string: returns `True`
- String with all characters being the same: returns `True`
- String with at least one character different from the first character: returns `False`

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the program:

- `assert func_1('python') == False`: returns `False` because 'p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n' are not all the same.
- `assert func_1('aaa') == True`: returns `True` because all characters are 'a'.
- `assert func_1('data') == False`: returns `False` because 'd', 'a', 't', 'a' are not all the same.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it correct.
