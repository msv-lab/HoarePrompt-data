You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns Boolean value True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting entirely of the same character, which is `first_char`, `first_char` is the first (and every) character of `s`, `char` equals `first_char` if the loop completes without returning `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the input string `s` consists entirely of the same character. It returns `True` if the string is empty or if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with a single character, and a string with multiple characters. If the string is empty, the function immediately returns `True`. If the string is not empty, the function iterates over each character in the string, checking if it matches the first character. If a mismatch is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string consists entirely of the same character. The function's return value is a Boolean that reflects the result of this check.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
