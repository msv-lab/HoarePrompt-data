Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program only removes lowercase characters. 

For example, if the input string is "aAbc", the program will return "AB", but the expected output should be "AB" without considering "a" and "bc" as separate characters but as substrings. This is because "a" and "bc" are lowercase substrings, but the program does not handle them as such.

A correct program would need to identify sequences of lowercase characters and remove them entirely, not just individual lowercase characters. 

For instance, the program should return "A" for the input "abcAdef", because "abc" and "def" are lowercase substrings that should be removed. However, the provided program will return "A", which is correct in this case but it is just a coincidence. 

The provided program does not handle the case where the input string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters correctly according to the problem description. 

A correct implementation would require a different approach, such as iterating over the string and checking for sequences of lowercase characters, and then removing those sequences. 

Here's an example of how a correct implementation could look like:

```python
def remove_lowercase_substrings(s):
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            j = i
            while j < len(s) and s[j].islower():
                j += 1
            i = j
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```

This implementation correctly removes lowercase substrings from the input string.
