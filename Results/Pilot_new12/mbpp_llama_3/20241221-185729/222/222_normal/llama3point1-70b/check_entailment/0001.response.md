Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings, but the provided program only removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings.

For example, if the input string is "aBcD", the program will return "BD", which is correct. However, if the input string is "aBcdE", the program will return "BE", which is also correct. But if the input string is "abcDE", the program will return "DE", which is correct. However, the issue arises when considering the case where the input string is "ABcDE". The program will return "ABDE", which is correct but if we consider the case where the substring "c" is not removed because it is part of the substring "ABcDE" and the code is not designed to handle substrings it is only designed to handle individual characters.

A better test case would be the string "aABbB". In this case, the program will return "ABB" which might seem correct at first but the issue here is that the program is designed to remove individual characters not substrings. A correct implementation of the function should check for the presence of lowercase substrings (which can be more than one character) and remove them entirely.

So a correct implementation of this would be more complex, involving checking all substrings of the string, not just individual characters. 

In this example, the code provided only handles individual characters and does not actually check for substrings, hence it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
