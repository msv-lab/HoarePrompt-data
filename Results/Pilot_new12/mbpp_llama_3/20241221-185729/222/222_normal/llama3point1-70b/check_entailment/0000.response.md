Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It iterates over each character in the input string `s`. If the character is uppercase (determined by `char.isupper()`), it is appended to the result string. 

This approach ensures that all lowercase characters (which can be considered as part of lowercase substrings) are excluded from the result, effectively removing lowercase substrings. It's worth noting that while the term "substring" often refers to a sequence of characters within a string, the function's behavior aligns with a more literal interpretation of removing lowercase characters.

For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", which are the uppercase characters. This demonstrates that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

One potential point of discussion is the interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings." If one interprets this as removing entire sequences of lowercase characters (regardless of their position or length within the string), the function still appears to behave correctly, as it removes all lowercase characters, effectively addressing sequences of lowercase characters as well.

Given the input string "aBcDeF", the function will correctly return "BDEF", removing all lowercase characters as expected. 

In conclusion, based on the provided problem description and the observed behavior of the function, the program appears to meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is considered correct.
