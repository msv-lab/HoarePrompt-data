Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided code only removes lowercase characters, not substrings. A substring is a sequence of characters, and the code does not check for sequences of lowercase characters. It simply checks each character individually and removes it if it's lowercase.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function should return "HW", because "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings. But the provided code will return only the uppercase characters "H" and "W" and any other uppercase characters, ignoring the fact that the lowercase characters are part of a substring. 

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that it filters out non-uppercase letters, but they do not mention anything about substrings, which is the main requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
