To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze both closely.

The problem description asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. This means the function should take a string as input, identify all sequences of lowercase letters within that string, and return a new string with all those sequences removed.

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1(s)` that iterates over each character in the input string `s`. It checks if a character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method and, if so, appends it to the `result` string. After processing all characters, it returns the `result` string, which contains all the uppercase letters from the original string.

However, the key point in the problem description is the removal of "lowercase substrings," which refers to any sequence of one or more lowercase letters. The given program does not explicitly identify and remove sequences of lowercase letters but instead filters out individual characters that are not uppercase. This achieves a similar outcome in the sense that no lowercase characters (or sequences thereof) remain in the output string, because the program only includes uppercase characters in the output.

Given this analysis, it can be argued that the program effectively meets the requirement specified in the problem description. It ensures that the output string does not contain any lowercase substrings by only including uppercase characters. Therefore, even though the program's approach might not explicitly match the colloquial interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings," its net effect aligns with the desired outcome for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
