According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters and `char` must be the third character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string `s`**
