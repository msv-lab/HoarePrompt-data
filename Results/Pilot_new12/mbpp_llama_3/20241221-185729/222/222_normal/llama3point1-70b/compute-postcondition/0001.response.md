According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string and `result` is an empty string, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not empty and `char` is the first character in the string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the string**
