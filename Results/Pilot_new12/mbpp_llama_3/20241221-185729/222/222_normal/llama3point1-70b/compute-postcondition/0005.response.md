To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `char` is the first character in the string `s`.
- The state of `result` depends on whether `char` is an uppercase letter or not.

Loop statement: `for char in s`

For the loop to execute again, it needs to move to the next character in the string `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `char` is the first character in the string `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `s` must have at least two characters because the loop needs to move to the next character.
- `char` should be the second character in the string `s` because the loop will iterate over each character in `s` in sequence.

The state of `result` after the first iteration could be one of two things depending on whether the first character was uppercase or not, but this does not affect the iteration process itself. It will be updated based on the new `char` (the second character in `s`) in the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string `s`**
