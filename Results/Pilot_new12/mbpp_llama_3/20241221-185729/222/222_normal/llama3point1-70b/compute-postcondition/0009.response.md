The code `result += char` appends the value of `char` to `result`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string with at least 3 characters and `char` is the third character in `s`. 

Given that `char` is the third character in the string `s`, and assuming `result` was initially defined (though its initial value is not specified), `result` will now be the sum of its initial value and `char`. If `result` was not initially defined as a string, this would cause an error, but given the context, we'll assume `result` is a string or at least can be concatenated with a string.

The value of `s` and `char` does not change, only `result` does.

Output State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string `s`, `result` is the initial value of `result` plus the third character of `s`.**
