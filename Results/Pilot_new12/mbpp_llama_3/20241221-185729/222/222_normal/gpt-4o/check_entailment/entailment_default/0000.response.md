Correctness: **False**.

The code is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but what it actually does is remove all lowercase characters from the string, not just substrings. For example, if the input string is 'aBCdE', the expected output should be 'BCdE' (only the substring 'a' is removed), but the actual output is 'BCE' (all lowercase characters 'a' and 'd' are removed).

A correct implementation would involve checking for sequences of lowercase characters and removing them as a whole, not just individual lowercase characters. The current code does not meet this requirement, so it is considered incorrect.
