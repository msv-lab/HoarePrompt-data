The original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect based on the assumption that the intention is to remove continuous substrings that are in lowercase. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code and considering the unit tests provided, it appears that the intention is to remove individual lowercase characters rather than continuous substrings.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`, `assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`, and `assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`, suggest that the expected behavior is to remove individual lowercase characters, rather than continuous substrings. The annotated code also supports this interpretation, as it states that the program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.

Given this information, it seems that the original assessment may not be accurate. The program appears to be correctly implementing the function to remove individual lowercase characters from a given string.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the provided unit tests, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
