Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It iterates over each character in the input string `s` and checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the new string; otherwise, it is excluded.

The function effectively filters out any lowercase characters, leaving only uppercase characters in the resulting string. This aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings, as the presence of any lowercase characters triggers their removal.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a string), the function will work as expected for all potential cases. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios, including strings with mixed case characters.

For example, the input `'PYTHon'` results in the output `'PYTH'`, which matches the expected behavior of removing the lowercase substring `'on'`. Similarly, the input `'FInD'` yields the output `'FID'`, demonstrating the removal of the lowercase substring `'n'`.

Overall, the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
