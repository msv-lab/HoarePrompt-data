Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it actually removes all lowercase characters, not just substrings.

For example, if the input string is 'aBa', the function should return 'Ba' because 'a' is a lowercase substring and it has a length of 1. However, the function will return 'B' because it removes all lowercase characters, not considering them as substrings.

To correctly implement the function, it should find all sequences of lowercase characters in the string and remove them, not just individual lowercase characters. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            while i < len(s) and s[i].islower():
                i += 1
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```
