Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program only filters out lowercase characters, effectively treating each character individually rather than considering sequences of lowercase characters.

For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the program would return "HW" because it only considers individual characters, not substrings. This does not meet the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from the string.

To meet the problem description, the program should identify all sequences of lowercase characters in the string and remove those sequences, not just individual lowercase characters.

For example, a correct function would return "PYTH" when given "PYTHon" because it removes the substring "on", which is a lowercase substring. However, the provided function does this correctly due to the way it filters out all lowercase characters, but this is a coincidence and not a correct implementation of the problem description.

A correct implementation would need to specifically target and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters, to accurately meet the problem description.

Here's an example of a string that would demonstrate the issue: "HelloWORLDhello". The program provided would return "HWORLD" because it filters out all lowercase characters, but a correct implementation of the problem description should return "WORLD" because "Hello" and "hello" are both lowercase substrings that should be removed.
