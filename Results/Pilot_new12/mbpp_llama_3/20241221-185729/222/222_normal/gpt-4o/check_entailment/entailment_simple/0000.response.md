Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description by removing all lowercase characters from the given string. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the resulting list, which is then joined back into a string.

This approach effectively removes all lowercase characters from the original string, resulting in a string containing only the uppercase characters. The provided unit tests, such as `func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`, also demonstrate the correctness of the function.

The problem description asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but since a substring can be a single character, this can be interpreted as removing all lowercase characters. In this context, the provided function correctly meets the requirements.

It is worth noting that if the problem description intended to remove only sequences of lowercase characters (i.e., substrings consisting of only lowercase characters), the function would need to be modified accordingly. However, based on the provided unit tests and the interpretation that removing lowercase substrings means removing all lowercase characters, the function is correct.
