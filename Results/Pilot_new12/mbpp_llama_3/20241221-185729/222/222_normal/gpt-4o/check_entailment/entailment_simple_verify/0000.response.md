The original assessment claims that the provided function `func_1` is incorrect because it removes all lowercase characters, not just lowercase substrings. However, upon closer examination of the problem description, it seems that the function is actually intended to remove lowercase characters, not necessarily substrings.

The problem description states "Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string." However, the term "substring" in this context could be interpreted as a sequence of characters within the string. In this case, the function `func_1` does indeed remove sequences of lowercase characters (albeit individual characters) from the string.

The annotated code supports this interpretation, stating that the program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. This indicates that the function is working as intended, at least according to the provided unit tests.

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`, `assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`, `assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`) also suggest that the function is intended to remove individual lowercase characters, not just substrings.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate.

Final: **True**
