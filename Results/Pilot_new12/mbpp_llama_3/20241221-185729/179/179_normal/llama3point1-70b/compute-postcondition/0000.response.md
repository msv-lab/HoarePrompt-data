To find the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet. The code calculates the sum of the cubes of even integers from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive), where `n` is a positive integer.

Given the initial state that `n` is a positive integer, the range of numbers considered will be from 2 to `2n + 2 - 2` = `2n` (because `n * 2 + 1 - 1` = `2n`), but since the step is 2, it includes `2n` and goes up to `2n` when `n` is even or stops before `2n+1` when `n` is odd but still includes `2n` in the sum. 

The expression `i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates a sequence of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`. This means for any positive integer `n`, the program will return the sum of cubes of all even integers up to `2n`.

For example, if `n` is 3, the program calculates the sum of cubes of even integers from 2 to 6 (2, 4, 6). 

The sum will be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3` = `8 + 64 + 216` = `288`.

However, since `n` can be any positive integer, the actual sum returned depends on the value of `n`. The general formula for the sum of cubes of even numbers up to `2n` is what the program returns.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 up to 2n, where n is a positive integer.**
