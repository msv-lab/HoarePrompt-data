Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's why it's correct:

1. The function uses a generator expression to generate the first `n` even natural numbers. The `range` function starts from 2 (the first even natural number), increments by 2 (to generate only even numbers), and stops at `n * 2 + 1`, which ensures that `n` even numbers are generated.

2. For each even number `i` generated, the expression `i ** 3` calculates its cube.

3. The built-in `sum` function then adds up all these cubes to produce the final result.

The function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Positive integers: For any positive integer `n`, the function will correctly calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
- Edge case: When `n` is 0, the function returns `0`, which is the correct result since there are no even numbers to sum.

Since the function works as expected for all possible inputs and edge cases, it is correct.
