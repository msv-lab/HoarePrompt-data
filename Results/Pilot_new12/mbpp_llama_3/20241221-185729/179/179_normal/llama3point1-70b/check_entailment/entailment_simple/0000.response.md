Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of even natural numbers to consider.
2. The `range` function generates a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive), with a step size of 2. This ensures that only even numbers are considered.
3. The `sum` function calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))`.
4. The `**` operator calculates the cube of each even number `i`.
5. The `return` statement returns the calculated sum.

For any positive integer `n`, this program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 3, the program calculates the cube sum of 2, 4, and 6, which are the first three even natural numbers.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
