Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

- The function uses a generator expression to generate the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. 
- It uses `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` to generate the first n even numbers, starting from 2 and incrementing by 2 each time. 
- The `sum` function then adds up these cubes to give the total cube sum.

For example, if `n = 3`, the function will calculate the cube sum of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2, 4, and 6. The cube sum will be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which is the correct result.

This function will work correctly for any positive integer `n`, as it correctly generates the first n even natural numbers, cubes them, and sums them up. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
