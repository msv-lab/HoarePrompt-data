Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), cubes each number, and sums them up.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 up to `2n`. The hints also mention that the function handles all positive integer values of `n` correctly and its output is deterministic.

The code correctly implements the problem description, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected. The function uses the `range` function with a step size of 2 to generate the sequence of even numbers, and the `sum` function to calculate the sum of cubes. The use of a generator expression ensures that the function is efficient and can handle large values of `n`.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
