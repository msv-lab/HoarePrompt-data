Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that uses a generator expression to generate the cubes of the first n even natural numbers and sums them up using the `sum` function.

The output hints provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality, stating that it accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 up to `2n`. This aligns with the problem description and the provided code.

The original assessment correctly breaks down the function's behavior, explaining how it generates the first n even natural numbers using `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, cubes them, and sums them up. The assessment also provides an example of the function's correct behavior for `n = 3`.

The output hints do not provide any evidence that contradicts the original assessment. Instead, they reinforce the idea that the function correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment and conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
