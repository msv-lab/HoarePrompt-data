Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) and calculates the cube of each number using the exponentiation operator `**`. The `sum` function then adds up these cubes to produce the final result.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function correctly handles all positive integer values of `n` and returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 up to `2n`. The function does not modify the input parameter `n` and only performs a calculation based on its value, returning the result without altering any external state.

Given that the input will be a valid positive integer, the function should work correctly for all potential cases. The use of a generator expression ensures efficient calculation, and the `sum` function correctly adds up the cubes of the even numbers. Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
