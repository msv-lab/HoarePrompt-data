#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 up to 2n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 up to `2n`. This includes all even numbers in the range [2, 2n] inclusive, with each number cubed and added to the total sum. The function does not modify the input parameter `n` and only performs a calculation based on its value, returning the result without altering any external state. The function handles all positive integer values of `n` correctly, and its output is deterministic, meaning that given the same input `n`, it will always return the same result.
