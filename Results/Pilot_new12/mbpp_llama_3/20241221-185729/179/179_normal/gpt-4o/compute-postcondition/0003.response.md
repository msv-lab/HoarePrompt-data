The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns `cube_sum`, which is calculated as \( 2n^2(n+1)^2 \). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the calculated `cube_sum` based on the given formula.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer parameter n and returns the calculated cube_sum as 2n^2(n+1)^2.**
