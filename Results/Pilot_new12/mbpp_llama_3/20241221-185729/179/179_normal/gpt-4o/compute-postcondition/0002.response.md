The `cube_sum` is calculated as \( 2n^2(n+1)^2 \), where `n` is a positive integer. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the value of `cube_sum` will be a positive integer as well because it's a result of squaring and multiplying positive integers and 2.

Output State: **The program returns cube_sum, which is equal to \( 2n^2(n+1)^2 \), where n is a positive integer.**
