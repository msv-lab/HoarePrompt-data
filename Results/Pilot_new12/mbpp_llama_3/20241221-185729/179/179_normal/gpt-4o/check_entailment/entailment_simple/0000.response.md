To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

The given function `func_1(n)` generates the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension, cubes each number, and sums them up. 

Here's the explanation of how the function works:
- It first generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using the expression `(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)`. This creates a list of numbers from `2` to `2n`, which are the first `n` even natural numbers.
- It then calculates the cube of each number in the list and sums these cubes using the expression `sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
- The result, which is the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, is then returned by the function.

Given the mathematical formula provided in the comments of the function, \( 2n^2(n+1)^2 \), let's verify if this formula indeed represents the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Mathematically, the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers can be represented as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \). However, the problem asks for the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, which can be represented as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i)^3 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 8i^3 = 8\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = 8 \times \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} = 2n^2(n+1)^2 \).

This matches the formula given in the comments of the function, indicating that the function indeed calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers correctly.

Based on the explanation and the mathematical verification, the program appears to be correct in terms of fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
