Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a Python function that calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers. The function uses list comprehension to generate the first n even natural numbers and a generator expression to calculate the sum of their cubes.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function generates the first n even natural numbers correctly using the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. The sum of cubes is calculated correctly using the generator expression `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.
3. The provided unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800` demonstrate the correctness of the function for specific inputs.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Positive integer inputs: The function correctly calculates the sum of cubes for any positive integer input.
* Edge cases: The function handles edge cases such as `n = 1` correctly, returning the cube of the first even natural number, which is 2^3 = 8.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, and all the examples provided work correctly, the program is considered correct.
