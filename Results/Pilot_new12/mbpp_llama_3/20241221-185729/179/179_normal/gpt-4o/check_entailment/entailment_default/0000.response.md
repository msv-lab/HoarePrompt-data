Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the even numbers from 2 to `2n`, and then calculates the sum of their cubes using a generator expression. 

The function's implementation is consistent with the problem description, which asks for the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The provided output hints confirm this understanding, indicating that the function returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n`.

The code also passes the provided unit tests, which check the function's output for specific inputs (`n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`). These tests suggest that the function behaves as expected.

Assuming that the input will be a valid positive integer, the function does not contain any apparent errors or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the code appears to be correct in every case.
