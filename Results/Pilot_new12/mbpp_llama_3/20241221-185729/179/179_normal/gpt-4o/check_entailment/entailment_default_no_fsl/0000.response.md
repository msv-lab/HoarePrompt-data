Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers from 2 to `2n`, and then uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of the cubes of these numbers.

The program description and the output hints both indicate that the function should return the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n`. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected for positive integer inputs.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where `n` is not a positive integer. The function correctly calculates the cube sum for the specified range of even numbers and returns the result. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
