Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, which means we need to calculate the sum of the cubes of the numbers 2, 4, 6,..., 2n. 

The provided function, `func_1(n)`, does exactly this. It first generates a list of even numbers from 2 to 2n using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This list includes all the even natural numbers up to the nth even number, which is 2n. 

Then it calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`. This correctly computes the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers.

The return statement, `return cube_sum`, then provides this calculated sum as the output of the function, directly addressing the requirement stated in the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function by checking its output against expected values for specific inputs. 

Since the function accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, and there are no indications of edge cases or invalid inputs that would cause the function to fail (as per the assumptions provided), the correctness of the program is confirmed.
