Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

The function first generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension. Then, it calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) verify the correctness of the function for specific inputs. These tests demonstrate that the function correctly computes the cube sum for different values of `n`. 

Upon analyzing the function, it is evident that it accurately implements the mathematical formula for calculating the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function does not seem to have any edge cases that would cause it to fail, as it correctly handles the generation of even numbers and the computation of their cubes.

For example, when `n = 2`, the even numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are 8 and 64, respectively. The sum of these cubes is indeed 72, which matches the expected result in the first `assert` statement.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, it appears that the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
