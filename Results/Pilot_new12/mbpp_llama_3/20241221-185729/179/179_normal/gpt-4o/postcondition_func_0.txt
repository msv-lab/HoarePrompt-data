The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n`, which is calculated as `2n^2(n+1)^2`. The function does not modify the input `n` and only performs calculations based on it, resulting in a single output value. The function does not handle edge cases where `n` is not a positive integer, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for such cases. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the calculated sum of cubes is returned, and the original input `n` remains unchanged.
