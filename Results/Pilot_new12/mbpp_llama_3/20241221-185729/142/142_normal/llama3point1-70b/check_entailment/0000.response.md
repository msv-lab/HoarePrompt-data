Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(lst, element)` checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It utilizes the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression to compare each item in the list with the given element. 

The function will return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. This includes the case where the list is empty, in which `all()` will return `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true.
2. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` compares each item in the list with the given element.
3. If any item in the list is not equal to the given element, the `all()` function will short-circuit and return `False`.
4. If the list is empty, the `all()` function will return `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element.

Since the function works as expected for all possible inputs, including empty lists and lists with multiple elements, the code is correct.
