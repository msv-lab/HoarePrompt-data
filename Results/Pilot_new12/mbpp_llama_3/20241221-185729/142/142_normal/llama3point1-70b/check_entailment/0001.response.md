Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an `element` as parameters. It uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Handling Empty Lists**: The `all()` function returns `True` for an empty iterable. Since an empty list has no elements to compare, it can be considered that all its elements (none) are equal to the given element. Therefore, the function correctly returns `True` for an empty list.

2. **Handling Single-Element Lists**: For lists with a single element, `all()` will correctly return `True` if the single element matches the given element, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Handling Multi-Element Lists**: For lists with multiple elements, the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` will generate a sequence of boolean values indicating whether each item is equal to the given element. `all()` will then return `True` if all these boolean values are `True` (i.e., all elements are equal to the given element), and `False` otherwise.

4. **Type Comparison**: The program will work correctly for elements of any type that supports equality comparison, including but not limited to integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases without any exceptions or omissions. Therefore, it is considered correct according to the problem description.
