## Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description. It takes in a list `lst` and an element, and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters, `lst` and `element`, which aligns with the problem description's requirement of taking in a list and an element.

2. **All Elements Equal Check**: The function uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`. This directly addresses the problem description's requirement.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise. This behavior matches the problem description's specification.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As per the guidelines, it's assumed that the input will always be valid (i.e., `lst` will be a non-empty list, and `element` will be an item that can be compared with the elements in `lst`). Under this assumption, the function does not need to include error checking or handling for invalid inputs.

In summary, the function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior specified in the problem description for all potential valid input cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
