Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

The code defines a function `func_1` that checks whether all elements in the input list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The function uses the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to achieve this.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if the list is empty or if all elements match the provided element, and `False` otherwise. The hints also mention that the function handles edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and multi-element lists, which is consistent with the code's implementation.

The original assessment provides a thorough breakdown of why the code is correct, including its handling of empty lists, single-element lists, and multi-element lists, as well as its support for elements of any type that supports equality comparison.

Considering all the information available, I conclude that the program is correct and that the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the described functionality, handles all potential cases, and behaves as expected according to the output hints.

Final: **True**
