The original assessment of the program's correctness seems accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(lst, element)` indeed checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element by leveraging the `all()` function in conjunction with a generator expression that compares each item in the list to the given element.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. Right before the function call, it's annotated that `lst` is a list and `element` is an item that can be compared with the elements in `lst`, which matches the problem description's requirements. The annotation after the `all()` function call accurately describes the return behavior of the function: it returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise.

Given that the code handles the comparison correctly and returns the expected boolean value based on the comparison of the list's elements with the given element, there's no reason to doubt the original assessment.

Furthermore, the assumption that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program aligns with the problem description and does not introduce any scenarios where the program could fail to meet its specifications due to invalid input.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem.

Final: **True**
