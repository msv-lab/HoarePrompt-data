Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a Python function named `func_1` that checks whether all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. It utilizes the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to efficiently evaluate this condition for every item in the list.

The reason this code is correct for every potential case, as per the problem description, is as follows:

1. **Empty List**: The `all()` function returns `True` for an empty iterable, which aligns with the common mathematical convention that an empty set satisfies any universal predicate. This means that if the input list `lst` is empty, the function correctly returns `True`, as there are no elements that do not match the given `element`.

2. **List with a Single Element**: If the list contains only one element, `func_1` correctly checks if this single element is equal to the provided `element`, returning `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise.

3. **List with Multiple Elements**: For lists with more than one element, the function iterates through each item (using the generator expression within `all()`), checking if each item is equal to the specified `element`. It returns `True` only if all elements match the `element` and returns `False` as soon as it encounters an element that does not match.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as an empty list (as mentioned) and lists containing `None` or other types of objects correctly, as long as the equality check (`==`) is well-defined for the elements' type. Given that we assume valid inputs, the function behaves as expected for all these scenarios.

5. **Non-modification of Input**: The function does not modify the input list `lst` or the `element`, adhering to the principle of not altering input parameters unless explicitly stated otherwise.

6. **Boolean Return Type**: It consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), indicating whether all elements in the list are equal to the given element, which directly addresses the problem description.

Considering these points, the code accurately implements the desired functionality as specified in the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases under the assumption of valid input.
