The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and after analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that this assessment is accurate.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an element, and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function uses the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression to compare each item in the list with the given element.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if the list is empty or if all elements in the list are equal to the element, and `False` otherwise. The hints also mention that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements, without modifying the input list or the element.

The reasoning behind the original assessment is sound, as it breaks down the function's behavior into steps and explains how the `all()` function and the generator expression work together to achieve the desired result.

Given the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I can see no reason to doubt the original assessment. The program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the analysis, I conclude that the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
