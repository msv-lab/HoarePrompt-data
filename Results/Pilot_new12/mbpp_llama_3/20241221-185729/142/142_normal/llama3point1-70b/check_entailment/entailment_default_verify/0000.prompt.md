You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(lst, element)` checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It utilizes the built-in `all()` function along with a generator expression to compare each item in the list with the given element. 

The function will return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. This includes the case where the list is empty, in which `all()` will return `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true.
2. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` compares each item in the list with the given element.
3. If any item in the list is not equal to the given element, the `all()` function will short-circuit and return `False`.
4. If the list is empty, the `all()` function will return `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element.

Since the function works as expected for all possible inputs, including empty lists and lists with multiple elements, the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the input list `lst` are equal to the provided `element`. It returns `True` if the list is empty or if all elements in the list are equal to the element, and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements. It does not modify the input list `lst` or the `element`, and it only returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list match the provided element.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
