Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function that checks whether all items in a list are equal to a given element. The provided function, `func_1`, uses the built-in `all()` function in Python, which returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that compares each item in the list to the given element.

The function handles all potential cases as described in its annotation:
- If the list is empty, `all()` returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element.
- If the list contains a single element, `all()` returns `True` if the element equals the given element, and `False` otherwise.
- If the list contains multiple elements, `all()` returns `True` only if all elements are equal to the given element.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list and a comparable element), the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It does not modify the input list or the element and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list match the provided element.
