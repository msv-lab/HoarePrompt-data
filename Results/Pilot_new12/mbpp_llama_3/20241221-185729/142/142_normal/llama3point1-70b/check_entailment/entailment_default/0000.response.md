Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code originally looks correct. The `func_1` function checks if all elements in the input list `lst` are equal to the provided `element`. The `all` function in Python returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that compares each item in the list to the element. If any item is not equal to the element, the `all` function will return `False`. Otherwise, it will return `True`.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function checks if all elements in the list are equal to the provided element and returns `True` if the list is empty or if all elements in the list are equal to the element, and `False` otherwise. This description matches the behavior of the code.

For every potential case, the code should work correctly:

- An empty list will return `True`, as the `all` function will return `True` for an empty iterable.
- A list with a single element will return `True` if the element matches the provided element, and `False` otherwise.
- A list with multiple elements will return `True` if all elements match the provided element, and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the code meets the requirements in the problem description, and I conclude that it is correct.
