You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an `element` as parameters. It uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Handling Empty Lists**: The `all()` function returns `True` for an empty iterable. Since an empty list has no elements to compare, it can be considered that all its elements (none) are equal to the given element. Therefore, the function correctly returns `True` for an empty list.

2. **Handling Single-Element Lists**: For lists with a single element, `all()` will correctly return `True` if the single element matches the given element, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Handling Multi-Element Lists**: For lists with multiple elements, the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` will generate a sequence of boolean values indicating whether each item is equal to the given element. `all()` will then return `True` if all these boolean values are `True` (i.e., all elements are equal to the given element), and `False` otherwise.

4. **Type Comparison**: The program will work correctly for elements of any type that supports equality comparison, including but not limited to integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases without any exceptions or omissions. Therefore, it is considered correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is an item that can be compared with the elements in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all elements in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise it returns False


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
