To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state provided.

The initial state tells us that:
- `lst` is a list.
- `element` is an item that can be compared with the elements in `lst`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return all(item == element for item in lst)
```

This code uses a generator expression within the built-in `all()` function to check if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

Given this information, the program will return `True` if every item in `lst` is equal to `element`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

Therefore, the output state is directly related to the comparison between `element` and the items in `lst`.

Output State: **The program returns True if all elements in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', otherwise it returns False**
