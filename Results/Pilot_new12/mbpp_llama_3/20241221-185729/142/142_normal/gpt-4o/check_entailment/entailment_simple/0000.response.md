Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates over each `item` in the list `lst`.
2. For each `item`, it checks if `item` is not equal to `element`. If this condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all items in the list are equal to `element`.
3. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that all items in the list are equal to `element`, so the function returns `True`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `True`, which is correct because an empty list satisfies the condition that all its elements (of which there are none) are equal to `element`.
* If `lst` contains at least one element not equal to `element`, the loop returns `False` as soon as it encounters such an element.
* If all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, the loop completes without returning `False`, and the function returns `True`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and its logic is sound and consistent with the problem description.
