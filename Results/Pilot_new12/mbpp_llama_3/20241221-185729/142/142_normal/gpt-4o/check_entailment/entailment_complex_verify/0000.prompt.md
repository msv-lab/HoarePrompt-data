You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether all items in the given list are equal to the specified element. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it encounters an item that does not match the given element. If the function completes the iteration without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list match the given element.

This implementation meets the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles lists of different data types, including strings and integers, and it correctly handles lists of varying lengths. The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as empty lists and lists with a single element.

For example, if the input list is `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` and the given element is `'blue'`, the function correctly returns `False`. Similarly, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the given element is `7`, the function correctly returns `False`. If the input list is `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` and the given element is `'green'`, the function correctly returns `True`.

Overall, the function `func_1` is a simple and effective implementation that meets the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element can be of any type that can be compared for equality with the elements in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list, and if `lst` is not empty, either all elements in `lst` are equal to `element` (in which case the loop completes without returning False), or the loop returns False as soon as it encounters an element not equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list `lst` is either empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, and returns `True` if `lst` is empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise returns `False`. This includes edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, a list with multiple elements, and elements of any type that can be compared for equality. The function does not modify the input list or element, and its return value indicates whether the list contains only the specified element or is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
