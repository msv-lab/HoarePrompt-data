Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether all items in the given list are equal to the specified element. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it encounters an item that does not match the given element. If the function completes the iteration without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list match the given element.

This implementation meets the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles lists of different data types, including strings and integers, and it correctly handles lists of varying lengths. The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as empty lists and lists with a single element.

For example, if the input list is `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` and the given element is `'blue'`, the function correctly returns `False`. Similarly, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the given element is `7`, the function correctly returns `False`. If the input list is `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` and the given element is `'green'`, the function correctly returns `True`.

Overall, the function `func_1` is a simple and effective implementation that meets the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
