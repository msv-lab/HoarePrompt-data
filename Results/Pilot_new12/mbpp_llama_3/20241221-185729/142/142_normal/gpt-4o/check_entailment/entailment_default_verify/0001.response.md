Based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an `element` as input and checks if all elements in the list are equal to the given element. The output hints provide additional context that the function should return `True` if the list is empty or all elements in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

The code correctly implements this functionality. It iterates through each item in the list and immediately returns `False` if it encounters an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes iterating through the list without finding any items that are not equal to the given element, it returns `True`.

However, the output hints introduce a nuance that was not explicitly addressed in the original assessment: the function should return `True` if the input list is empty. While the original assessment noted that this case was not explicitly tested, it mentioned that the function would return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the behavior described in the output hints.

The reason the original assessment is accurate is that the code indeed implements the described functionality correctly for all the specified cases, including the edge cases. The output hints reinforce this conclusion by describing the expected behavior in a manner consistent with the code's implementation.

Therefore, considering the program, the problem description, and the output hints, the assessment that the program meets the requirements and works as expected is justified.

Final: **True**
