You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an `element`, and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly in every case:

1. The function iterates through each item in the list using a for loop.
2. If it encounters an item that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`.
3. If the function completes iterating through the list without finding any items that are not equal to the given element, it returns `True`.

This logic ensures that the function will only return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. 

There are no edge cases that the code does not handle. For example, it correctly handles:

- Empty lists: Although not explicitly tested, the function would return `True` for an empty list because the for loop would not execute and the function would return the default value `True`, which is the expected behavior since an empty list can be considered as a list where all elements (i.e., none) are equal to any given element. However, based on the specific problem description, it's possible to argue that an empty list should return `False` for any non-empty input, as there are no elements to compare. The provided unit tests do not cover this case, but it could be considered a potential point of discussion depending on the precise interpretation of the problem statement.
- Lists containing different data types: The function works correctly even if the list contains elements of different data types, because Python's `!=` operator can compare objects of different types.
- Lists containing duplicate elements: The function correctly handles lists that contain duplicate elements, including the case where all elements are the same but not equal to the given element.

Overall, the code correctly implements the described functionality, and there are no obvious cases where it does not work as expected based on the provided problem description and unit tests.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, and returns `True` if `lst` is empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise returns `False`. This includes edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, a list with multiple elements, and elements of any type that can be compared for equality. The function does not modify the input list or element, and its return value indicates whether the list contains only the specified element or is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
