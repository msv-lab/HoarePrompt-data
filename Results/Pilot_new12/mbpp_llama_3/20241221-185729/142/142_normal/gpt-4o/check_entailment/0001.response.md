Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an `element`, and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly in every case:

1. The function iterates through each item in the list using a for loop.
2. If it encounters an item that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`.
3. If the function completes iterating through the list without finding any items that are not equal to the given element, it returns `True`.

This logic ensures that the function will only return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. 

There are no edge cases that the code does not handle. For example, it correctly handles:

- Empty lists: Although not explicitly tested, the function would return `True` for an empty list because the for loop would not execute and the function would return the default value `True`, which is the expected behavior since an empty list can be considered as a list where all elements (i.e., none) are equal to any given element. However, based on the specific problem description, it's possible to argue that an empty list should return `False` for any non-empty input, as there are no elements to compare. The provided unit tests do not cover this case, but it could be considered a potential point of discussion depending on the precise interpretation of the problem statement.
- Lists containing different data types: The function works correctly even if the list contains elements of different data types, because Python's `!=` operator can compare objects of different types.
- Lists containing duplicate elements: The function correctly handles lists that contain duplicate elements, including the case where all elements are the same but not equal to the given element.

Overall, the code correctly implements the described functionality, and there are no obvious cases where it does not work as expected based on the provided problem description and unit tests.
