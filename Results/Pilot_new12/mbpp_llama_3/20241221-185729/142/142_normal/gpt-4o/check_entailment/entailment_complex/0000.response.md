Correctness: **False**

The program does not strictly follow the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. However, the program returns `True` if the list is empty, which means it does not contain any elements, let alone the given element. The function should return `False` for an empty list, as it does not contain all elements equal to the given element, because it does not contain any elements at all.

The correct implementation should return `False` for an empty list, and the given program does not meet this requirement. The correct function should be:

```python
def func_1(lst, element):
    if not lst:  # Check if the list is empty
        return False
    for item in lst:
        if item!= element:
            return False
    return True
```

This revised function correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, and returns `False` for an empty list.
