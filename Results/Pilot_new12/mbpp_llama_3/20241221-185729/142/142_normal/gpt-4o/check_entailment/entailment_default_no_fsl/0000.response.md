Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. According to the output hints, the function should return `True` if the list `lst` is empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`. However, the provided code does not handle the case when the input list is empty. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([], 'green')`, the function should return `True` according to the output hints, but the code does not explicitly handle this case. The code only checks if each item in the list is not equal to the element, and if it finds such an item, it immediately returns `False`. If the list is empty, the `for` loop will not execute, and the function will return `True`, which is correct. However, the code does not explicitly check for this case.

But a more serious issue is that the function description says it should return `True` if "all items in the list are equal to the given element". It does not mention anything about the list being empty, but the output hints do. So the function description does not match the code functionality as described by the output hints. This discrepancy makes the code incorrect.

So, the code is incorrect because it does handle some edge cases but the problem description and code functionality do not agree.
