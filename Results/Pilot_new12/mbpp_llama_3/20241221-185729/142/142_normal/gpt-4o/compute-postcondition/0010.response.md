To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information and the loop code itself.

The loop code is:
```python
for item in lst:
    if item!= element:
        return False
```

1. **If the loop executes at least once**: This means `lst` is not empty. For the loop to continue executing (i.e., not return False), each `item` in `lst` must be equal to `element`. 

2. **Condition for the loop to execute without returning False**: Every `item` in `lst` must be equal to `element`. If at any point `item` is not equal to `element`, the function will return False, indicating that not all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.

3. **Case when the loop does not execute**: If `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, the function will not return False, implying that an empty list meets the condition of all its elements (none, in this case) being equal to `element`, but this does not explicitly set any return value. However, given the structure of the provided output states, if the loop does not execute (because `lst` is empty), there's no change in the state regarding the comparison, but in terms of logic, an empty list could be considered as meeting the condition since there are no elements that are not equal to `element`.

Given these considerations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

- If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute, and there's no explicit return value set by the loop, implying a "truthy" condition if we were to interpret the absence of a return as True (all elements, of which there are none, are equal to `element`).
- If `lst` is not empty and all elements are equal to `element`, the loop executes without returning False, again implying a truthy condition.
- The variable `item` will be the last element in `lst` if the loop completes without returning False.

However, the actual question asks for the output state in terms of variable values and relationships after the loop has finished executing, considering the loop might return False at any iteration if an `item` is not equal to `element`.

Thus, considering the loop's structure and the conditions under which it executes or returns False, the output state that captures the essence of the loop's completion (without focusing on the return value, which isn't directly asked but rather on the state of variables) can be understood as follows:

Output State: **`lst` is a list, and if `lst` is not empty, either all elements in `lst` are equal to `element` (in which case the loop completes without returning False), or the loop returns False as soon as it encounters an element not equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute.**
