According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements and the `item` is the third element in the list.
State: **`lst` is a list with at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in the list**
