Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, and returns `True` if `lst` is empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise returns `False`. This includes edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, a list with multiple elements, and elements of any type that can be compared for equality. The function does not modify the input list or element, and its return value indicates whether the list contains only the specified element or is empty.**
