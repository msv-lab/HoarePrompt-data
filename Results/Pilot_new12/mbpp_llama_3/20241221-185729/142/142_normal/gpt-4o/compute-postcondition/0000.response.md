According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state only mentions that `lst` is a list, but it does not ensure that the list is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `lst` must have at least 1 element, and `item` is the first element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the list**
