The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `element`. `lst` is a list and `element` can be of any type that can be compared for equality with the elements in `lst`. After executing the function body, the function returns `True` if the list `lst` is either empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`; otherwise, it returns `False` in all other cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returns `True` if `lst` is empty or all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, otherwise returns `False`.**
