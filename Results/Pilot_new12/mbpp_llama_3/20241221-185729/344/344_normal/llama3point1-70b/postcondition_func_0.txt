The function accepts a sorted list and a comparable value, then returns the index of the first element in the sorted list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, the function returns the total number of elements in the sorted list. The function performs a linear search through the sorted list, checking each element against the given value, and returns the index where the condition is met or the length of the list if the loop completes without finding such an element. The function handles edge cases where the given value is less than the first element in the list (returning 0), greater than or equal to the last element in the list (returning the index of the last element or the length of the list), or equal to an element in the list (returning the index of that element). The function's return value can be any non-negative integer up to the length of the sorted list, including 0, 1, 2, or the total number of elements in the sorted list.
