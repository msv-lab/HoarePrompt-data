Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It iterates over the `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the `value`.
- If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i` of that element, which is the correct insertion point for the `value` to maintain the sorted order.
- If the `value` is greater than all elements in the `sorted_list`, it returns the length of the `sorted_list`, which is the correct insertion point to append the `value` at the end.

This approach ensures that the `value` will be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order of the list.

Some example cases to consider:

- If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `value` is `4`, the function returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point.
- If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `value` is `10`, the function returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point to append the `value` at the end.
- If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `value` is `0`, the function returns `0`, which is the correct insertion point.

After analyzing these cases and understanding the logic of the function, it appears that the function works correctly for all potential cases.
