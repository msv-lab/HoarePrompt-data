Correctness: **True** 

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order within a given sorted list. This function iterates through the sorted list, and as soon as it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it returns the index of that element. If the specified value is greater than all elements in the sorted list, it returns the length of the list, indicating that the value should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain sorted order.

This function correctly handles several key cases:

1. **Value already in the list**: If the value is already present in the list, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to the specified value, which is correct because the function is designed to find the right insertion point to maintain sorted order.

2. **Value greater than all elements in the list**: If the specified value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which corresponds to the end of the list. This is the correct insertion point for maintaining sorted order.

3. **Value less than all elements in the list**: If the specified value is less than all elements in the list, the function iterates through the entire list without finding a value greater than or equal to the specified value and returns the length of the list. However, this is a special case where the function essentially works because the value should indeed be inserted at the beginning of the sorted list. But considering the description, it might imply that it should return 0. In the context of finding the "right" insertion point in a sorted list, though, and considering typical implementations like `bisect.insort_right`, returning the length of the list here actually indicates the value should go at the end, which might seem incorrect for a "right" insertion. However, the logic here actually correctly identifies where to insert to maintain sorted order for values that would be placed at the beginning, as it will return 0 when it encounters the condition (since at the first element, if the value is less than the first element, it returns 0, which is correct).

4. **Duplicate values in the list**: The function handles duplicate values correctly. It will insert the value at the correct position to maintain sorted order, even if there are duplicates.

The function seems to be working as expected based on the problem description, assuming the interpretation that it finds the rightmost insertion point for the value to maintain sorted order is correct. Therefore, without finding any case where the function fails to meet the problem description's requirements, we consider the function to be correct. 

However, it's worth noting that this implementation has a linear time complexity because it potentially scans the entire list. For larger lists, a more efficient approach could be using a binary search algorithm to find the insertion point, which would have a logarithmic time complexity. But in terms of correctness, the given function seems to meet the requirements.
