To verify the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1` in terms of meeting the problem description, let's analyze its behavior step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem description asks for a function that locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This means, given a sorted list and a value, the function should return the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

### Function Analysis
The function `func_1(sorted_list, value)` iterates through the `sorted_list` to find the first element that is greater than or equal to the `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i` of that element. This index is where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, as all elements before this index are less than the `value`, and the element at this index is greater than or equal to the `value`.

If the loop completes without finding an element that is greater than or equal to the `value`, it means the `value` is greater than all elements in the `sorted_list`. In this case, the function returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that the `value` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain sorted order.

### Correctness Analysis
The function behaves as expected for the following cases:
1. **Value is less than all elements in the list**: The function will return `0` because it will not find any element in the list that is greater than or equal to the value, thus indicating the value should be inserted at the beginning.
2. **Value is equal to an element in the list**: The function will return the index of the first occurrence of an element that is greater than or equal to the value, effectively inserting the new value after all previous occurrences of the same value, maintaining sorted order.
3. **Value is greater than all elements in the list**: The function will return the length of the list, indicating the value should be appended to the end, thus maintaining the sorted order.

Given these analyses, the function correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, adhering to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
