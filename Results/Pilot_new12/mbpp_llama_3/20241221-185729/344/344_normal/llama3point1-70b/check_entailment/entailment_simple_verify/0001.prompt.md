You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True** 

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order within a given sorted list. This function iterates through the sorted list, and as soon as it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it returns the index of that element. If the specified value is greater than all elements in the sorted list, it returns the length of the list, indicating that the value should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain sorted order.

This function correctly handles several key cases:

1. **Value already in the list**: If the value is already present in the list, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of a value greater than or equal to the specified value, which is correct because the function is designed to find the right insertion point to maintain sorted order.

2. **Value greater than all elements in the list**: If the specified value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which corresponds to the end of the list. This is the correct insertion point for maintaining sorted order.

3. **Value less than all elements in the list**: If the specified value is less than all elements in the list, the function iterates through the entire list without finding a value greater than or equal to the specified value and returns the length of the list. However, this is a special case where the function essentially works because the value should indeed be inserted at the beginning of the sorted list. But considering the description, it might imply that it should return 0. In the context of finding the "right" insertion point in a sorted list, though, and considering typical implementations like `bisect.insort_right`, returning the length of the list here actually indicates the value should go at the end, which might seem incorrect for a "right" insertion. However, the logic here actually correctly identifies where to insert to maintain sorted order for values that would be placed at the beginning, as it will return 0 when it encounters the condition (since at the first element, if the value is less than the first element, it returns 0, which is correct).

4. **Duplicate values in the list**: The function handles duplicate values correctly. It will insert the value at the correct position to maintain sorted order, even if there are duplicates.

The function seems to be working as expected based on the problem description, assuming the interpretation that it finds the rightmost insertion point for the value to maintain sorted order is correct. Therefore, without finding any case where the function fails to meet the problem description's requirements, we consider the function to be correct. 

However, it's worth noting that this implementation has a linear time complexity because it potentially scans the entire list. For larger lists, a more efficient approach could be using a binary search algorithm to find the insertion point, which would have a logarithmic time complexity. But in terms of correctness, the given function seems to meet the requirements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements in sorted order, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and if the loop executes, `i` would represent the index where the condition is met or the last index if the loop completes without finding such an element, though the function's behavior post-loop completion isn't defined by the loop code itself.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the total number of elements in the sorted_list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
