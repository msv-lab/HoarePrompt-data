You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` seems to correctly locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It iterates over the `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the `value`.
- If it finds such an element, it returns the index `i` of that element, which is the correct insertion point for the `value` to maintain the sorted order.
- If the `value` is greater than all elements in the `sorted_list`, it returns the length of the `sorted_list`, which is the correct insertion point to append the `value` at the end.

This approach ensures that the `value` will be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order of the list.

Some example cases to consider:

- If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `value` is `4`, the function returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point.
- If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `value` is `10`, the function returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point to append the `value` at the end.
- If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` and `value` is `0`, the function returns `0`, which is the correct insertion point.

After analyzing these cases and understanding the logic of the function, it appears that the function works correctly for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements in sorted order, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and if the loop executes, `i` would represent the index where the condition is met or the last index if the loop completes without finding such an element, though the function's behavior post-loop completion isn't defined by the loop code itself.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the total number of elements in the sorted_list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
