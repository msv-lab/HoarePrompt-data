#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements in sorted order, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and if the loop executes, `i` would represent the index where the condition is met or the last index if the loop completes without finding such an element, though the function's behavior post-loop completion isn't defined by the loop code itself.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the total number of elements in the sorted_list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list and a comparable value, then returns the index of the first element in the sorted list that is greater than or equal to the given value. If no such element is found, the function returns the total number of elements in the sorted list. The function performs a linear search through the sorted list, checking each element against the given value, and returns the index where the condition is met or the length of the list if the loop completes without finding such an element. The function handles edge cases where the given value is less than the first element in the list (returning 0), greater than or equal to the last element in the list (returning the index of the last element or the length of the list), or equal to an element in the list (returning the index of that element). The function's return value can be any non-negative integer up to the length of the sorted list, including 0, 1, 2, or the total number of elements in the sorted list.
