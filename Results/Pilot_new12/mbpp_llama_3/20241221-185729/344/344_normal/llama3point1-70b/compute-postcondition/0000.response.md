To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement.

The loop statement is: `for i in range(len(sorted_list)):`

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `sorted_list` must be defined and accessible.
2. `sorted_list` must have at least one element for the loop to execute at least once. If `sorted_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order.
- `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`.

Adjusting the state for the loop to execute:
- `sorted_list` must have at least one element.
- `i` is the index, which starts at 0.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order that must have at least one element, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, `i` is 0**
