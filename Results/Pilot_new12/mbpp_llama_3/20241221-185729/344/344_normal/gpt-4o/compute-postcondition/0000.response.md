To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This function performs a binary search, which is efficient for sorted lists.

Given that `sorted_list` is sorted in a specific order (either ascending or descending), and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, the function will return an index.

Since `bisect.bisect_right` is used, the returned index is the position where `value` should be inserted to the right of any existing entries of `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order.

Output State: **The program returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of `sorted_list`.**
