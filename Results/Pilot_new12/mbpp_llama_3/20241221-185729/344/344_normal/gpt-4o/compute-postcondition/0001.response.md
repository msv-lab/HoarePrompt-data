The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a list of elements that can be compared, and it is sorted in a specific order (either ascending or descending). `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`. After executing the function body, the function returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of `sorted_list`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
