#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements that can be compared, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list, and sorted_list is sorted in a specific order (either ascending or descending).
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of `sorted_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the correct insertion point for a given value in a sorted list to maintain the list's sorted order, handling both ascending and descending orders, and returns the corresponding index as a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the sorted list, effectively allowing the user to insert the value at the correct position while preserving the list's sorted state, covering edge cases such as insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the list, as well as handling duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements.
