You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.

The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function for different scenarios, such as when the value is greater than the last element in the list, when the value is between two elements in the list, and when the value is greater than the last element in the list.

To verify the correctness of the function, let's consider some additional edge cases:

* An empty list: `func_1([], 5)` should return 0, which is correct.
* A single-element list: `func_1([5], 3)` should return 0, and `func_1([5], 7)` should return 1, both of which are correct.
* A duplicate value in the list: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], 2)` should return 3, which is correct.

In all the considered cases, the `func_1` function behaves as expected, returning the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function determines the correct insertion point for a given value in a sorted list to maintain the list's sorted order, handling both ascending and descending orders, and returns the corresponding index as a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the sorted list, effectively allowing the user to insert the value at the correct position while preserving the list's sorted state, covering edge cases such as insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the list, as well as handling duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
