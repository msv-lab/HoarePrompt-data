Correctness: **True**

The code provided uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from Python's standard library, which returns the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list to maintain sorted order. This function is designed to work correctly with both ascending and descending orders and handles edge cases such as inserting at the beginning, end, or middle of the list.

Given the problem description and the code, the `bisect.bisect_right` function is a direct and suitable implementation for finding the insertion point of a value in a sorted list while maintaining the list's sorted state. It correctly handles duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements, as indicated by the output hints.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various scenarios, including inserting values that are greater than, less than, or equal to the existing elements in the sorted list.

The key to the correctness of this implementation lies in the `bisect.bisect_right` function's behavior, which is to return an index where the value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, ensuring that for every potential case, the function will return the correct insertion point.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the code's functionality, and the provided output hints, the code is correct and handles all potential cases as expected.
