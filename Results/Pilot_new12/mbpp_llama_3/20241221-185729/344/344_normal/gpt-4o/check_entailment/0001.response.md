Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.

The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function for different scenarios, such as when the value is greater than the last element in the list, when the value is between two elements in the list, and when the value is greater than the last element in the list.

To verify the correctness of the function, let's consider some additional edge cases:

* An empty list: `func_1([], 5)` should return 0, which is correct.
* A single-element list: `func_1([5], 3)` should return 0, and `func_1([5], 7)` should return 1, both of which are correct.
* A duplicate value in the list: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], 2)` should return 3, which is correct.

In all the considered cases, the `func_1` function behaves as expected, returning the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order. Therefore, the program is correct.
