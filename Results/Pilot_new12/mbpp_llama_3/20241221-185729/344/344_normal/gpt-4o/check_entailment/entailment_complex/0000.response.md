Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function works by finding the insertion point for the `value` in the `sorted_list` while maintaining the sorted order. It handles both ascending and descending orders and returns the corresponding index as a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the `sorted_list`. This function also handles edge cases such as insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the list, as well as handling duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `6` in the sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. Similarly, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `3` in the sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly determines the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
