Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description by locating the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This index is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of `sorted_list`. 

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the program. For example, when the input list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the function returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order. Similarly, when the value is `3`, the function returns `2`, which is also the correct insertion point.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to find the insertion point for a value in a sorted list, and it does so in a way that maintains the sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
