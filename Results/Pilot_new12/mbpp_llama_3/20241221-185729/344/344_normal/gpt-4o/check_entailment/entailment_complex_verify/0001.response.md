Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment makes sense. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to return the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context and confirms that the function handles edge cases such as insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the list, as well as handling duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements.

The original assessment correctly identified that the `func_1` function behaves as expected, returning the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order for different scenarios, including when the value is greater than the last element in the list, when the value is between two elements in the list, and when the value is greater than the last element in the list.

The original assessment also considered additional edge cases, such as an empty list, a single-element list, and a list with duplicate values, and found that the function behaves correctly in these cases.

The annotated version of the code does not provide any new information that would suggest the original assessment is incorrect. Instead, it confirms that the function behaves as expected and provides the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
