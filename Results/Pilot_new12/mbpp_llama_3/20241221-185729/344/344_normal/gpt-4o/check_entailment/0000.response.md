Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function uses the `bisect` module's `bisect_right` function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the specified value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.

The unit tests provided in the code also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, when the input list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the function correctly returns `4`, indicating that the value `6` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain the sorted order.

In addition, the function handles edge cases, such as when the value is less than the smallest element in the list or greater than the largest element in the list. The `bisect_right` function is designed to handle these cases correctly.

Given that the function uses a well-tested and widely-used library function (`bisect.bisect_right`) and that the provided unit tests confirm its correctness, it is reasonable to conclude that the function works as expected for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
