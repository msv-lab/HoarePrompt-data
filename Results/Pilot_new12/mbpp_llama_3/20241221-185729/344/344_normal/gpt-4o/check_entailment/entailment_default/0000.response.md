Correctness: **True**.

The provided code uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module in Python, which is specifically designed to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list to maintain the sorted order. This function handles both ascending and descending orders by default.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to the right of any existing equal elements, which aligns with the problem description's requirement to handle duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, covering edge cases such as insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the list. The provided unit tests also support the code's correctness, demonstrating its ability to return the correct insertion index for various scenarios.

Given the use of the `bisect.bisect_right` function, which is a built-in and well-tested part of the Python standard library, and considering the unit tests and output hints provided, the code appears to correctly implement the described functionality for all potential cases, assuming valid input as per the guidelines.
