The function determines the correct insertion point for a given value in a sorted list to maintain the list's sorted order, handling both ascending and descending orders, and returns the corresponding index as a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the sorted list, effectively allowing the user to insert the value at the correct position while preserving the list's sorted state, covering edge cases such as insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the list, as well as handling duplicate values by inserting the new value to the right of existing equal elements.
