Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains any duplicate elements, and `False` otherwise.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the unique elements encountered so far.
2. The function iterates over each element `num` in the input list `arr`.
3. For each element, it checks if `num` is already in the `seen` set. If it is, it means that `num` is a duplicate element, and the function immediately returns `True`.
4. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it adds `num` to the `seen` set and continues to the next element.
5. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any duplicate elements, it returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain any duplicate elements.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases:

* If the input list is empty, the function will return `False`, which is correct because an empty list does not contain any duplicate elements.
* If the input list contains only unique elements, the function will return `False`, which is correct because there are no duplicate elements.
* If the input list contains at least one duplicate element, the function will return `True`, which is correct because there is at least one duplicate element.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and it does so in a efficient and concise manner.
