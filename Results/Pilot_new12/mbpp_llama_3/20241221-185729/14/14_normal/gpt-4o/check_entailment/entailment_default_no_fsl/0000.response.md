Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. The function `func_1` iterates through the array, adding each number to a set. If a number is already in the set, it means that number is a duplicate, and the function immediately returns `True`. If the function iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The program handles edge cases such as an empty list, in which case it returns `False`. This is because an empty list does not contain any duplicate integers. The function also only considers the presence of duplicate integers and does not modify the original list `arr`.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases, and the output hints agree with the code, the program is correct.
