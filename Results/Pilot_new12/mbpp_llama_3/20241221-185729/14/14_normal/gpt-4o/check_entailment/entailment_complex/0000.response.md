Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of unique elements encountered so far.
2. It then iterates over each element `num` in the input array `arr`.
3. For each element, it checks if `num` is already present in the `seen` set. If it is, that means a duplicate has been found, and the function immediately returns `True`.
4. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it is added to the set to keep track of unique elements encountered so far.
5. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating that no duplicates were found in the input array.

The program handles edge cases such as an empty list correctly, as it returns `False` in such cases. Additionally, the function only considers the presence of duplicate integers and does not modify the original list `arr`.

The provided assertions also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False`: No duplicates are present, so the function returns `False`.
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True`: A duplicate is present, so the function returns `True`.
* `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True`: Duplicates are present, so the function returns `True`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and its correctness is demonstrated through the provided assertions and explanations.
