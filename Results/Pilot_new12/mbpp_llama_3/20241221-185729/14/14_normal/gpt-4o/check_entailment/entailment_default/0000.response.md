Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are duplicate integers in the list. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the numbers it has encountered, and if it finds a number that is already in the set, it immediately returns `True`. If it processes all numbers in the list without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list, in which case it returns `False`. Additionally, the function only considers the presence of duplicate integers and does not modify the original list `arr`.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code, as they cover various scenarios, including lists with and without duplicates.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases, and the output hints and unit tests agree with the code, the correctness of the code is **True**.
