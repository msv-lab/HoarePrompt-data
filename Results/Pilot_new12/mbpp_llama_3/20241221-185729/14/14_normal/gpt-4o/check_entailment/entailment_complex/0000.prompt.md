You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing unique integers from `arr` up to the point where either all numbers have been processed or a duplicate is found, and if a duplicate is found, the function returns `True`. If `arr` is empty, `seen` remains an empty set.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that no duplicate was found in the list `arr`, and the set `seen` contains unique integers from `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are duplicate integers in the list. If a duplicate is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after processing all numbers in the list, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, in which case it returns `False`. Additionally, the function only considers the presence of duplicate integers and does not modify the original list `arr`. The function's return value can be used to determine the presence or absence of duplicates in the input list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
