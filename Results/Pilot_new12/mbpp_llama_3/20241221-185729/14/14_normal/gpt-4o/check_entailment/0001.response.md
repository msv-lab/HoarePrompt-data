Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly checks if there are any duplicate elements in a given array of integers. Here's a breakdown of why it works as expected:

- The function initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the unique numbers it encounters in the array.
- It then iterates over each number `num` in the array.
- For each number, it checks if `num` is already in the `seen` set. If it is, that means `num` has been encountered before, indicating a duplicate. In this case, the function immediately returns `True`.
- If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it adds `num` to the set and continues to the next number in the array.
- If the function iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates (i.e., without returning `True`), it returns `False`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements in the array.

This approach is efficient because checking membership in a set is a constant time operation, on average, in Python, making the overall time complexity of the function O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) validate the function's behavior for arrays with no duplicates, arrays with duplicates, and arrays with multiple duplicates, which helps ensure the function is working correctly for various cases. Given that the function's logic correctly implements the required functionality and the unit tests validate its behavior, it can be concluded that the function works as expected for all potential cases.
