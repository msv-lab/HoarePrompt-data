The code snippet `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. 

Given that `num` is the third integer in the list `arr` and `seen` is a set containing at least the first, second, and third integers in `arr`, adding `num` to `seen` does not change the fact that `seen` contains at least the first, second, and third integers in `arr`, because `num` is already in `seen` as it is the third integer in `arr`. 

However, if we consider the condition "If `num` is in `seen`, the program returns True. Otherwise, the program returns None", since `num` is added to `seen` (but was already there), `num` is definitely in `seen`. Thus, the program should return `True`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `seen` is a set containing at least the first, second, and third integers in `arr`, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`, and the value `True` has been returned**
