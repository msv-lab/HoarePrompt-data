The code adds `num` to the set `seen`. Initially, `seen` contains the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is the second integer in `arr`. 

If `num` is in `seen` after the addition, it means `num` was already in `seen`, so the program returns True. 

However, if `num` is not in `seen` after the addition, `num` was not in `seen`, so the program state remains unchanged.

Given that `seen` initially contains the first integer in `arr`, and `num` is the second integer in `arr`, after adding `num` to `seen`, `seen` now contains at least the first and second integers in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `seen` is a set containing at least the first and second integers in `arr`, `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`.**
