The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the `seen` set. The initial state is: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first integer in the list, and `num` is not in the `seen` set.

Given that `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`, we know that `num` is an integer. After executing the code, `num` is added to the `seen` set. Therefore, the `seen` set now contains the first integer of the list `arr`.

The states of `arr` and the fact that `arr` has at least one integer are not affected by the code. The value of `num` is also not changed by the code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is a set containing the first integer in `arr`, `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`.**
