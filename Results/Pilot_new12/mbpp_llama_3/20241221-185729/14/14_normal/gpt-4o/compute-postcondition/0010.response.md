According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 integers, `seen` contains at least the first and second integers in `arr`, and `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 3 integers, `seen` must contain at least the first, second, and third integers in `arr`, and `num` must be the third integer in the list `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `seen` is a set containing at least the first, second, and third integers in `arr`, `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`**
