To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

1. The loop iterates over each number `num` in the list `arr`.
2. For each `num`, it checks if `num` is already in the set `seen`. If `num` is in `seen`, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate number has been found in `arr`.
3. If `num` is not in `seen`, it adds `num` to the set `seen`.

Given this logic, let's consider the possible outcomes:

- If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `seen` will remain an empty set because no numbers are iterated over to be added to `seen`.
- If `arr` contains unique numbers (no duplicates), the loop will iterate over all numbers in `arr`, adding each to `seen`. After the loop finishes, `seen` will contain all numbers from `arr`.
- If `arr` contains duplicate numbers, the loop will iterate until it encounters a number that is already in `seen`. At this point, it will return `True` without adding the duplicate number to `seen` again. Thus, `seen` will contain all unique numbers from `arr` up to the point where the first duplicate is found.

However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention what happens to the variables if the loop returns early (i.e., when it finds a duplicate). But based on the given output states for the first few iterations, we can infer that the loop's execution and the state of variables are being considered up to the point where the loop either completes normally (if no duplicates are found) or returns early (if a duplicate is found).

Considering all possible scenarios:

- `arr` is a list of integers, which may or may not contain duplicates.
- If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set.
- If `arr` contains at least one integer and no duplicates, `seen` will contain all unique integers from `arr` after the loop completes.
- If `arr` contains at least one duplicate integer, the loop will return `True` as soon as it encounters a duplicate, and `seen` will contain all unique integers up to that point.

Given these considerations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished (or the loop returns early) can be described as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set containing unique integers from `arr` up to the point where either all numbers have been processed or a duplicate is found, and if a duplicate is found, the function returns `True`. If `arr` is empty, `seen` remains an empty set.**
