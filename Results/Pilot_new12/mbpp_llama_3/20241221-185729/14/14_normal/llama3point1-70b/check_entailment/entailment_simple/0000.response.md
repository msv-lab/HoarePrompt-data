Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to determine whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. 

The provided function, `func_1(arr)`, uses the difference in length between the original list (`arr`) and a set created from the list (`set(arr)`) to determine if there are any duplicate integers. In Python, a set automatically removes duplicate elements, so if the lengths of the original list and the set are not equal, that means there were duplicate integers in the original list, which were removed in the set.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function works as intended:

1. **Set Creation**: The function converts the input list `arr` into a set `set(arr)`. This operation automatically removes any duplicate elements because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values.

2. **Length Comparison**: It then compares the length of the original list `arr` with the length of the set `set(arr)`. If the lengths are not equal (`len(arr)!= len(set(arr))`), it means that the original list had duplicate elements that were removed in the set.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the lengths are not equal, indicating the presence of duplicate integers, and `False` otherwise.

This approach is efficient and accurately solves the problem as described, assuming the input is a list of integers and will not cause any errors in the program, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description.
