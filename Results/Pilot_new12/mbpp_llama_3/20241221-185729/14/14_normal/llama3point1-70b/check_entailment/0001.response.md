Correctness: **True**

The given function, `func_1(arr)`, checks whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. It uses a set to remove duplicates from the array and then compares the length of the original array with the length of the set. If the lengths are not equal, it means there were duplicate elements in the array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why this function is correct:

1. **Handling duplicates**: If the array contains any duplicates, the set will automatically remove them because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate elements.
2. **Length comparison**: By comparing the length of the original array with the length of the set, the function can determine if any duplicates were present. If the lengths are not equal, it means there were duplicates.
3. **Handling edge cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly:
	* An empty array will return `False` because `len([]) == len(set([]))`.
	* An array with a single element will return `False` because `len([a]) == len(set([a]))`.
	* An array with all unique elements will return `False` because `len([a, b, c]) == len(set([a, b, c]))`.
	* An array with duplicate elements will return `True` because `len([a, a, b])!= len(set([a, a, b]))`.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases, and accurately determines whether a given array contains any duplicate element, it is considered correct.
