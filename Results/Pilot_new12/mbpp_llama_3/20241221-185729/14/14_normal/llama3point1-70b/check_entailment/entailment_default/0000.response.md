Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths are not equal, it means that there are duplicate elements in the list, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach works correctly for every potential case, including edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists containing non-integer or non-hashable elements (which would not affect the function's behavior since the set operation would implicitly handle such elements by either including them if hashable or raising an error if not).

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `False` because there are no duplicate elements. If the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `True` because there is a duplicate element (`2`).

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior, including its handling of edge cases. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or an empty list. 

Overall, the code is correct and works as expected for every potential case.
