Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element by comparing the length of the original list `arr` with the length of a set created from the list. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Handling Duplicate Elements**: The program correctly identifies if the list contains duplicate integers. If the lengths of the list and the set are not equal, it means there were duplicate elements in the list which were removed in the set, so the function returns `True`. If the lengths are equal, it means all elements in the list are unique, and the function returns `False`.

2. **Edge Cases**: Although the problem statement assumes valid input, the program inherently handles some edge cases due to its implementation:
   - **Empty List**: For an empty list, `len(arr)` and `len(set(arr))` will both be 0, so the function will correctly return `False` because there are no duplicate integers in an empty list.
   - **List with a Single Element**: Similarly, for a list with a single element, both lengths will be 1, and the function will return `False`, indicating no duplicates.

3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Since the problem statement specifies that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to consider scenarios where the input is not a list or contains non-integer or non-hashable elements.

Overall, the program is designed to check for duplicate integers in a list by leveraging the properties of sets in Python, which automatically remove duplicates, making it an efficient solution that directly addresses the problem description's requirements.
