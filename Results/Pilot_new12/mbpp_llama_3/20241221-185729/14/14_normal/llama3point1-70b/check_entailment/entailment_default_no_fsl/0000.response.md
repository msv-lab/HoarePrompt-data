Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. Here's why:

1. The function uses the property that a set in Python cannot contain duplicate elements. When a list is converted to a set, all duplicate elements are automatically removed.
2. The function compares the length of the original list (`len(arr)`) with the length of the set created from the list (`len(set(arr))`).
3. If the lengths are not equal, it means there were duplicate elements in the list, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty list: `len([]) == len(set([]))`, so the function returns `False`.
* A list with a single element: `len([1]) == len(set([1]))`, so the function returns `False`.
* A list containing non-integer or non-hashable elements: Although the problem description specifies integers, the function will still work correctly for other hashable types. For non-hashable types (e.g., lists, dictionaries), the `set` operation will raise a `TypeError`, but this is not a correctness issue since we assume the input will be valid.

In summary, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior, and there are no cases where it fails to meet the problem description.
