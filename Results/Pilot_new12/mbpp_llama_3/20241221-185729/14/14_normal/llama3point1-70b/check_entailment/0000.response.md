Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks for duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the original array to the length of the array converted to a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements are automatically removed when the array is converted to a set.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because:

1. If the array contains no duplicates, the lengths of the array and the set will be equal, and the function will return `False`.
2. If the array contains one or more duplicates, the length of the set will be less than the length of the array, and the function will return `True`.

For example:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False` because there are no duplicates.
- `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])` returns `True` because there is a duplicate (2).

The function handles empty arrays correctly as well, since an empty array and an empty set both have a length of 0, and it also handles arrays with a single element correctly, since a set created from an array with a single element will also have a single element.

It's also worth noting that this function works correctly for arrays containing negative numbers and zero, because sets can contain these values. 

Overall, `func_1` correctly checks for duplicate elements in an array, and I couldn't find any potential case where it doesn't work as expected according to the problem description.
