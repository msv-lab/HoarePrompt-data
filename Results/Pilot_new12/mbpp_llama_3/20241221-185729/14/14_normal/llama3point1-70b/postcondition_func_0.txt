The function accepts a list of integers as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains duplicate integers. It returns True if the list contains at least one duplicate integer (i.e., the length of the list is not equal to the length of a set created from the list), and False otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as an empty list (which would return False since there are no elements to be duplicates), a list with a single element (also returning False for the same reason), and lists containing non-integer or non-hashable elements (which would not affect the function's behavior since the set operation would implicitly handle such elements by either including them if hashable or raising an error if not). The function does not modify the input list.
