#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and target is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference, however, based on the standard interpretation of such problems, it is assumed that arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is unused, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `min_diff` remains `float('inf')`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`, or `float('inf')` if `arr` has less than 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an unused parameter `target`, sorts the list in ascending order, and then returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. If the list has less than 2 elements, it returns `float('inf')`. The function does not modify the original list, instead, it creates a sorted copy of it. It handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by returning `float('inf')`. The unused parameter `target` has no effect on the function's behavior. The function's primary action is to calculate the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list of integers.
