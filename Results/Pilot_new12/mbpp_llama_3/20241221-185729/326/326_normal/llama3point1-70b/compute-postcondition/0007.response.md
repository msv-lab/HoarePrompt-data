To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the indices of the `arr` list, excluding the last index.

The current state is: 
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
- `target` is not used.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`.
- `min_diff` is equal to `diff` if the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr` is less than the initial `min_diff`, otherwise `min_diff` remains `float('inf')`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will definitely execute again if `arr` has at least 2 elements (which it does, according to the current state).

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. 

Also, since `i` is now 1, `diff` will be the absolute difference between the elements at indices 1 and 2 of `arr`, not the first two elements.

`min_diff` will remain the same as it was after the previous iteration, unless the new `diff` is smaller, in which case it will be updated to the new `diff`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`, and `min_diff` is the minimum of its previous value and the new `diff`**
