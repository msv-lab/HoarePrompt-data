The value of `min_diff` is updated to be equal to the current value of `diff`. The current value of `diff` is less than the initial value of `min_diff`, which was `float('inf')`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is not used, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`**
