The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. The value of `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, and `min_diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**
