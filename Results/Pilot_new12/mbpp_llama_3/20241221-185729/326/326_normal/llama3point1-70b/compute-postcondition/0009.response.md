The value of `min_diff` is updated to be equal to the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. Therefore, `min_diff` becomes equal to the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 1, `min_diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`.**
