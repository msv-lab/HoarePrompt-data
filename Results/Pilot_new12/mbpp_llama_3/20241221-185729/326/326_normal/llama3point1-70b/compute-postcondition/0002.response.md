According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference, and `min_diff` is `float('inf')`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is now 0.
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is not used, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0**
