Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is not used, initially `min_diff` was `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, initially `diff` was the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`, and the current value of `diff` is less than the initial value of `min_diff`**
