The code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state mentioned that `arr` is a list of integers and `target` is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference. After executing the code, the list `arr` is sorted, but there's no change in the fact that `target` is not used in this context.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference**
