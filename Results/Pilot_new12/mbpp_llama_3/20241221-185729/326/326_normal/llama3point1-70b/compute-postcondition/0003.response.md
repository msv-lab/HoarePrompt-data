The code calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the next element in the sorted list `arr`. 

`diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `diff` is the absolute difference between the first element and the second element of `arr`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is not used, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `diff` is `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is not used, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 0, `diff` is `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`**
