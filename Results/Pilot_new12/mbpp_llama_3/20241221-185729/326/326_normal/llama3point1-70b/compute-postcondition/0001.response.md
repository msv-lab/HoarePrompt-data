The code initializes the `min_diff` variable to positive infinity. The initial state mentions that `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `target` is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference. 

After executing the code, `min_diff` is assigned the value of positive infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference, `min_diff` is `float('inf')`**
