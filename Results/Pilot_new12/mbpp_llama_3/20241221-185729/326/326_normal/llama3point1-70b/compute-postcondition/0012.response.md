To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, and `i` is 2.

The code snippet is: `diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`

Given that `i` is 2, `arr[i]` refers to the third element in the list `arr`, and `arr[i + 1]` refers to the fourth element in the list.

Since `arr` is a sorted list, the difference between consecutive elements can vary. However, we can express the value of `diff` as the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr`.

So, `diff` is assigned the value of `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.

The states of `arr`, `target`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, except that a new variable `diff` is introduced.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 2, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr`, which can be expressed as `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**
