Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 0, `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`, and `min_diff` is equal to `diff` if the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr` is less than the initial `min_diff`, otherwise `min_diff` remains `float('inf')`***
