Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` is less than the previous minimum difference, then `min_diff` is updated to this new difference. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged, but since there's no else part, the values of `arr`, `target`, `i`, and `diff` remain the same as initially described.***
