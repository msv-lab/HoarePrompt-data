The code updates the value of `diff` to be the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`. Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` refers to the second element of `arr` and `arr[i + 1]` refers to the third element of `arr`. 

Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 1, the new value of `diff` is the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 1, `min_diff` is the minimum of its previous value and the new `diff`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is not used, `i` is 1, `min_diff` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`.**
