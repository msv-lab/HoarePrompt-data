Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an unused parameter `target`, sorts the list in ascending order, and then returns the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. If the list has less than 2 elements, it returns `float('inf')`. The function does not modify the original list, instead, it creates a sorted copy of it. It handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by returning `float('inf')`. The unused parameter `target` has no effect on the function's behavior. The function's primary action is to calculate the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list of integers.**
