Based on the provided information, the original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** due to the presence of an unused `target` parameter and potential issues with handling edge cases. However, the output hints provided indicate that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description despite the unused `target` parameter.

The function correctly sorts the list, calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements, and handles edge cases by returning `float('inf')` when the list has less than 2 elements. The unused `target` parameter does not affect the function's behavior, which aligns with the problem description of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Given the output hints and the program's behavior, it appears that the original assessment focused on the presence of the `target` parameter and potential edge cases, which are not directly relevant to the problem description. The program does meet the requirements specified in the problem description, as it correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

The key point here is that the problem description asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, and the provided code accomplishes this by sorting the array and comparing adjacent elements, which is a correct approach. The presence of the `target` parameter, although unnecessary, does not hinder the function's ability to solve the problem as described.

Therefore, considering the output hints and the program's behavior in relation to the problem description, I refine the assessment to conclude that the program is indeed correct for the specified task.

Final: **True**
