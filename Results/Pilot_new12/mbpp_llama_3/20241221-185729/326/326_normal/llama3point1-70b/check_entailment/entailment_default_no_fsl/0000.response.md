Correctness: **False**

The code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. The problem description asks for the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, but the code only checks the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. 

For example, if the input array is [1, 10, 2], the minimum difference between any two elements is 1 (between 1 and 2), but the code will return 8 (the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array [1, 2, 10]) is 1-2 which is not the minimum between any two elements but it happens that it is 2-10=8 and 1-2 = 1 and it returns 1, however for the array [5, 10, 4] the minimum difference will be 1 (between 4 and 5) and the code will return 1 because it compares 4-5 which are consecutive but if the list was [1, 10, 9] the output will be 1 because it compares 9-10 which is 1.

However a correct counter example is that the function is declared to take two parameters arr and target, but target is never used in the function. So the function can't work correctly if the problem requires using the target value to find the minimum difference. 

In addition, the code does not check the difference between non-consecutive elements. For example, if the input array is [1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25], the code will return 1 (the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array [1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25]) is 1, but a correct implementation of the problem should also check the difference between non-consecutive elements and return the minimum difference. 

However this is not the case for this example, because 18-19=1 which is the minimum between the consecutive elements in the sorted array [1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25]. 

A correct counterexample is if the list had elements [10, 20, 25] and [11, 20, 25], for both of the lists the output should be 1 however for the list [10, 20, 25] the output will be 5 which is incorrect. So a correct implementation should find all the possible pairs and find the minimum of their absolute differences, not just the minimum of the consecutive elements in the sorted array.
