Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python function is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the function has a parameter `target` which is not used within the function. This parameter is unnecessary and may cause confusion. 

Moreover, the function only compares adjacent elements in the sorted array. While this approach is correct because the minimum difference will always be between two adjacent elements in a sorted array, the presence of the `target` parameter is not only unnecessary but it also indicates that the function might be intended for a different purpose, such as finding the minimum difference between elements that are close to the `target` value. 

A more accurate implementation of the function based on the given problem description would be:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

Another potential issue with the original function is that it does not handle the case where the input array is empty or contains only one element. In such cases, the function will either raise an exception or return `inf`, which might not be the desired behavior. 

To handle these edge cases, the function could be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or any other value that makes sense for the specific use case
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
