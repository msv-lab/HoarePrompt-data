Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem statement asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function sorts the array first, which is a necessary step to ensure that the minimum difference is found between consecutive elements. It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements and updating the minimum difference if a smaller one is found.

The function correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by returning `float('inf')`. The unused parameter `target` does not affect the function's behavior, as stated in the annotations.

The key point here is that the problem description does not explicitly state that the minimum difference must be between any two elements, not necessarily consecutive ones. However, based on the standard interpretation of such problems and the provided annotations, it is assumed that the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements by first sorting the array, which makes all elements eligible for comparison as consecutive ones. 

In essence, the minimum difference between any two elements in an array will always be between two consecutive elements when the array is sorted. Therefore, the function correctly implements the problem description by finding this minimum difference.

It's worth noting, however, that if the problem description explicitly required finding the minimum difference between any two elements without the implicit step of sorting to ensure consecutive element comparisons, the interpretation might differ. But based on the information provided and standard problem-solving approaches, the function does what the problem description asks for.
