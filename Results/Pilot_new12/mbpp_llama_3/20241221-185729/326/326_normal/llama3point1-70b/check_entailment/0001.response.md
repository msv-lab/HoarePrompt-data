Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem asks to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, but the provided function, `func_1`, takes two parameters: `arr` and `target`. However, `target` is not used within the function.

A case where the program does not work as expected is when an empty array is passed to the function. The function will throw an error because it tries to access the length of the array without checking if it's empty.

Another case is when the function is called with a single-element array. The function should return `float('inf')` or a similar indication that the array does not contain at least two elements to calculate a difference, but it will return `float('inf')` without any special handling or warning, which might be misleading.

Lastly, the `target` parameter in the function definition is not used. This could imply that the function's intention is to find the minimum difference between two elements where one of them is the target, which would be a different problem than the one described.

To fix the function and make it correct according to the problem description, it should be modified to handle these edge cases and possibly renamed to something more descriptive like `min_difference`:

```python
def min_difference(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None  # or any other value to indicate the array must have at least 2 elements
    
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
