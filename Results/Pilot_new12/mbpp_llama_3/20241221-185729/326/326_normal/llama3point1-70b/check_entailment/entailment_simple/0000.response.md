Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a Python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` sorts the input array `arr` in ascending order. This is necessary to find the minimum difference between any two elements, as the minimum difference will always be between two adjacent elements in a sorted array.

2. The function initializes `min_diff` to `float('inf')`, which is a large positive value. This ensures that any difference between two elements will be smaller than the initial value of `min_diff`.

3. The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements. If the calculated difference is smaller than the current value of `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` to the new difference.

4. After iterating over the entire array, `min_diff` will hold the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. If the array has less than 2 elements, `min_diff` will remain `float('inf')`, which is a valid result because there are not enough elements to calculate a difference.

The only potential issue with the program is that it ignores the `target` parameter, but according to the problem description, `target` is not used in the context of finding the minimum difference. Therefore, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description, making it correct.
