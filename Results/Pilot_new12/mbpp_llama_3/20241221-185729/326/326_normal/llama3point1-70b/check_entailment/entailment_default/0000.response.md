Correctness: **False**

The code provided is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the function `func_1` has an unused parameter `target` which has no effect on the function's behavior. The function correctly sorts the array in ascending order, then calculates the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements.

But the issue is that the function only considers consecutive elements in the sorted array, not all possible pairs of elements. This is evident from the loop `for i in range(len(arr) - 1):` which only considers differences between adjacent elements.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the minimum difference between two elements is not between two consecutive elements in the sorted array. For example, if the input array is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 5]`, the sorted array will be `[5, 10, 20, 30, 40]`. The minimum difference between two consecutive elements is `5`, but the minimum difference between two elements (5 and 10) is indeed 5, however, if we had an array `[10, 5, 20, 30]` the sorted array will be `[5, 10, 20, 30]` and the minimum difference is indeed 5, between 5 and 10. However, in an array `[10, 20, 5, 25]` the sorted array will be `[5, 10, 20, 25]` and the minimum difference is indeed 5 between 20 and 25, but there is a smaller difference of 5 between 5 and 10.

To fix this issue, the function should consider all possible pairs of elements, not just consecutive ones. However, this will change the time complexity of the function from O(n log n) due to the sorting to O(n^2) for the comparison of all pairs.

Another issue is that the function does not use the `target` parameter at all. If the `target` parameter is intended to be used, then the function is not doing what it is supposed to do.

In summary, the code does not correctly implement the description of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, because it only considers consecutive elements in the sorted array. It also has an unused parameter `target`.
