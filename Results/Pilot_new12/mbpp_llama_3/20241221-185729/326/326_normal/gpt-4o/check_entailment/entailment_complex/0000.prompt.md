You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the number of elements in arr.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: arr is a list of integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the number of elements in arr, and n is larger than or equal to 2
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, `i` is `n-2`, `diff` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and its size `n`, and returns either 0 if `n` is less than 2, or the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the list `arr` in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements, which it then returns. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0, 1, or greater than or equal to 2, and it correctly calculates the minimum difference for lists with duplicate elements or lists with a single pair of elements. After the function executes, the state of the program is that the original list `arr` has been sorted in-place, and the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list (or 0 if `n` is less than 2) has been returned as the result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
