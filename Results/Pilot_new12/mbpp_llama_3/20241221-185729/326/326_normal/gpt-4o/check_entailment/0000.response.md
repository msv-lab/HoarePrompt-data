Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's why:

- The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. This is a valid edge case because with less than two elements, there are no pairs to compare.
- The function then sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted` function. This is necessary to find the minimum difference between any two elements, as the closest elements will be next to each other in the sorted array.
- The function initializes `min_diff` to infinity, which ensures that the first difference calculated will be smaller and update `min_diff`.
- The function then iterates over the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements and updating `min_diff` if a smaller difference is found.
- Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided examples seem to work correctly. For example, given the array `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)` with `n = 6`, the function correctly returns `1` as the minimum difference (between 18 and 19). Similarly, for the array `(4, 3, 2, 6)` with `n = 4`, the function returns `1` as the minimum difference (between 2 and 3 or 3 and 4). For the array `(30, 5, 20, 9)` with `n = 4`, the function returns `4` as the minimum difference (between 5 and 9).
