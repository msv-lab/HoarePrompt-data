Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, meets the requirements described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array by first sorting the array and then iterating through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements.

The function handles edge cases where the number of elements `n` is less than 2 by returning 0, as specified in the problem description. It also correctly handles cases where the input list `arr` contains duplicate elements or a single pair of elements.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality, demonstrating the function's correctness in various scenarios. The provided unit tests further confirm the function's correctness by verifying its output for different input cases.

Overall, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality and produces the expected output for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
