Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. After analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement this functionality.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. The function first checks if the input array `arr` has less than 2 elements (`n < 2`). In this case, it returns 0, which is a reasonable default value since the minimum difference between two elements cannot be calculated with a single element.

2. The function then sorts the input array `arr` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to easily compare adjacent elements to find the minimum difference.

3. The function initializes `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This variable will store the minimum difference found between any two elements.

4. The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements (`arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`). If this difference is less than the current `min_diff`, the function updates `min_diff` with the new value.

5. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which now holds the minimum difference between any two elements in the input array.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. After reviewing the code and considering potential edge cases, it appears that the function works as expected for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
