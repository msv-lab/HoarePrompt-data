Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description asks for a function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
2. The function `func_1` first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. This is a valid edge case because if there are less than 2 elements, there are no pairs to compare.
3. If `n` is 2 or more, the function sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It then initializes a variable `min_diff` to positive infinity and iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of consecutive elements.
5. If the calculated difference is less than the current `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` with the new value.
6. After iterating through the entire array, `min_diff` holds the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is equivalent to the minimum difference between any two elements in the original array (since the order of elements doesn't affect the minimum difference).

The function handles all cases correctly, including:

* Arrays with less than 2 elements (returns 0)
* Arrays with duplicate elements (the minimum difference will be 0)
* Arrays with non-integer elements (the problem description assumes the input will be valid, so this case is not considered)

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also verify the correctness of the function for various input cases.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and meets all requirements.
