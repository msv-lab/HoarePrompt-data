You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1
assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1
assert func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4) == 4

def func_1(arr, n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. After analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement this functionality.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. The function first checks if the input array `arr` has less than 2 elements (`n < 2`). In this case, it returns 0, which is a reasonable default value since the minimum difference between two elements cannot be calculated with a single element.

2. The function then sorts the input array `arr` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to easily compare adjacent elements to find the minimum difference.

3. The function initializes `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This variable will store the minimum difference found between any two elements.

4. The function then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements (`arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`). If this difference is less than the current `min_diff`, the function updates `min_diff` with the new value.

5. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which now holds the minimum difference between any two elements in the input array.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. After reviewing the code and considering potential edge cases, it appears that the function works as expected for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and its size `n`, and returns either 0 if `n` is less than 2, or the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the list `arr` in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements, which it then returns. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0, 1, or greater than or equal to 2, and it correctly calculates the minimum difference for lists with duplicate elements or lists with a single pair of elements. After the function executes, the state of the program is that the original list `arr` has been sorted in-place, and the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list (or 0 if `n` is less than 2) has been returned as the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
