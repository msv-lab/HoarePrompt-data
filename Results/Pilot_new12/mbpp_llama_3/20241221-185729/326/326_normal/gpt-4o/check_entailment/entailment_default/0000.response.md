Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements. If the number of elements `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. This approach correctly handles lists with duplicate elements or lists with a single pair of elements. 

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6) == 1` and `assert func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4) == 1`, demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases.

The output hints agree with the code, explaining that the function returns either 0 if `n` is less than 2 or the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The hints also mention that the function handles edge cases where `n` is 0, 1, or greater than or equal to 2, which further supports the code's correctness. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential valid cases.
