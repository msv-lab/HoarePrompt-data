The code sets `min_diff` to be equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, this means `min_diff` is now also `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`**
