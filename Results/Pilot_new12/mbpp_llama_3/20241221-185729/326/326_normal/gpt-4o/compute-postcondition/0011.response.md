The value of `diff` is updated to be equal to `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `diff` becomes `arr[2] - arr[1]`. However, given that `diff` was already equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, its new value remains the same. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` is either its previous value or updated to be equal to `diff`**
