The value of `diff` is assigned the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `arr`. Since `i` is 2, `diff` is assigned the difference between the 3rd element and the 2nd element in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order, so the difference between any two consecutive elements is non-negative, but since we don't know the exact values of the elements in `arr`, we can't determine the exact value of `diff`. However, we can say that `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
