Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. If `diff` is less than the original value of `min_diff` (positive infinity), then `min_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`.***
