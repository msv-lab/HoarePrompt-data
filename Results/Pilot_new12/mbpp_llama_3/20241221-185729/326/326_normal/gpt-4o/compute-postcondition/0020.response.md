The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer where `n` equals the number of elements in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on two possible cases: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: The function returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `arr` and its size `n`, and return either 0 or the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and its size `n`, returns either 0 or the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list.**
