Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 3, `i` is 1. If `diff` (which is `arr[2] - arr[1]`) is less than the previous `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` retains its previous value.***
