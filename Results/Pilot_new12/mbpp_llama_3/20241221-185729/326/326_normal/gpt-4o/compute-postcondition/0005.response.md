According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because the loop iterates `n-1` times. Given that `n` is already larger than or equal to 2 and `arr` has `n` elements, the initial state already supports the loop's execution condition. However, to ensure clarity on the state at the start of the loop, we should acknowledge that `i` will start at 0, as that's how `range(n-1)` behaves.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
