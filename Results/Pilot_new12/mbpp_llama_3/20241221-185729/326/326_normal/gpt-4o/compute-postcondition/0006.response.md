To determine the output state, let's break down the code's impact on the variables given the initial state.

1. `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
2. `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2.
3. `min_diff` is positive infinity.
4. `i` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
```

Given `i` is 0, `arr[i + 1]` refers to the second element in `arr` (since indexing starts at 0), and `arr[i]` refers to the first element in `arr`. 

Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the difference `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` will be a non-negative integer, because you're subtracting a smaller or equal number from a larger or equal number.

The value of `diff` is now the difference between the first two elements of `arr`. The states of `arr`, `n`, `min_diff`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state, considering the new value of `diff` and the unchanged values of the other variables, is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.
- `i` is 0.
- `diff` is the difference between the first two elements of `arr`, which is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
