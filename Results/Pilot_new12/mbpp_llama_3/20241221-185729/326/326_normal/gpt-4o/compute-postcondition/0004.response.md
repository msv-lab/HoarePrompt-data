The code initializes a variable `min_diff` to positive infinity. The values of `arr` and `n` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr`, where `n` is larger than or equal to 2, and `min_diff` is positive infinity**
