`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`arr` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `n` is still a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 4, `i` is still 2, and `diff` is still `arr[3] - arr[2]`.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, and `min_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
