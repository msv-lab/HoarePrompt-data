`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`, which was greater than `diff`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is less than the previous value of `min_diff` but now equal to the current value of `min_diff`.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**
