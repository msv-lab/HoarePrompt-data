According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be at least 3. Since `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements. 

Additionally, since `i` is now 2, we are looking at the difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[1]` in the previous iteration, so in the next iteration, we will be looking at the difference between `arr[3]` and `arr[2]`. This implies that `arr` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 4, `i` is 2**
