Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and its size `n`, and returns either 0 if `n` is less than 2, or the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the list `arr` in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements, which it then returns. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0, 1, or greater than or equal to 2, and it correctly calculates the minimum difference for lists with duplicate elements or lists with a single pair of elements. After the function executes, the state of the program is that the original list `arr` has been sorted in-place, and the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list (or 0 if `n` is less than 2) has been returned as the result.**
