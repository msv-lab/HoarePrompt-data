Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 4, `i` is 2. If `diff` (which is `arr[3] - arr[2]`) is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is set to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.***
