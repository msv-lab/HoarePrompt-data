The given Python code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr`, with `n` being larger than or equal to 2.

Given that `arr` is sorted, its elements are now in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it represents the number of elements in `arr`, which does not change with sorting.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr`, where `n` is larger than or equal to 2**
