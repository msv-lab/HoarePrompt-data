Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `arr` and is at least 2, initially `min_diff` was positive infinity, but given the current condition, the current value of `min_diff` is greater than `diff`, `i` is 0, initially `diff` was calculated as `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and the current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`.**
