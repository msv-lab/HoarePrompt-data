#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists` or negative infinity if `list_of_lists` is empty, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist with the maximum sum from `list_of_lists`, or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function also handles negative numbers and zero-sum sublists, returning the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie. The input list remains unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric values or non-list inputs, assuming that the input is well-formed. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy of it.
