The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, where `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `max_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `max_list` remains the same as before this iteration**
