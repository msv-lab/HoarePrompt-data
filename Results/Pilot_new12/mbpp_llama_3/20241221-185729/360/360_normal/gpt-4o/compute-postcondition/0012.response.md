Postcondition: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.**
