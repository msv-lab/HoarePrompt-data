The code `max_list = sublist` updates the value of `max_list` to be equal to `sublist`. The previous values of `list_of_lists`, `sublist`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `max_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`**
