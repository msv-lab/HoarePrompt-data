The code initializes an empty list `max_list`. This operation does not change the values of `list_of_lists` and `max_sum`. The state of `list_of_lists` remains a list of lists containing numbers, and the state of `max_sum` remains negative infinity. The new variable `max_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list**
