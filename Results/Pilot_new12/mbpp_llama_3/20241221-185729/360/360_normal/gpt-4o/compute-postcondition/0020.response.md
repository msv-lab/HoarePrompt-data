The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum from `list_of_lists`, or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of lists of numbers and return the sublist with the maximum sum, handling the case where the input list is empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists of numbers and returns the sublist with the maximum sum, or an empty list if the input list is empty.**
