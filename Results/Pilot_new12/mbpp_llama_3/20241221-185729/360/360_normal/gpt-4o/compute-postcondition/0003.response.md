The code calculates the sum of the current `sublist` (which is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`) and assigns it to `current_sum`. 

`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, so `sublist` is not empty and `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so `max_sum` remains negative infinity, `max_list` remains an empty list, and `sublist` remains the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`.**
