The value of `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is now equal to the sum of `sublist`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, but since `max_sum` and `current_sum` comparison is not performed in the given code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of `sublist`, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.**
