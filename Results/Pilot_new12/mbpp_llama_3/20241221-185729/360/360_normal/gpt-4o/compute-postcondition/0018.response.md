To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the output states provided for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of the current sublist, and checks if this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`. If it is, `max_sum` is updated to this new sum, and `max_list` is updated to the current sublist.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `list_of_lists` must have at least as many sublists as the number of times the loop has executed.
2. `sublist` is the current sublist being processed in the iteration.
3. `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current `sublist`.
4. If `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`, then `max_sum` and `max_list` are updated to `current_sum` and the current `sublist`, respectively. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.

Given this information, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `list_of_lists` remains the same as its initial state, as the loop does not modify it.
- `sublist` will be the last sublist that was processed in the loop.
- `current_sum` will be the sum of the last sublist processed, but this variable's value is not retained after the loop finishes.
- `max_sum` will be the maximum sum found among all sublists in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_sum` will remain negative infinity because the loop does not execute, and thus no sums are compared or updated.
- `max_list` will be the sublist with the maximum sum found. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` will remain an empty list because the loop does not execute.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios, including the case where `list_of_lists` might be empty:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists` or negative infinity if `list_of_lists` is empty, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.**
