To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists.
   - `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - `current_sum` is unknown and will be calculated based on the new `sublist`.
   - `max_sum` and `max_list` remain the same as in the previous iteration unless updated in the new iteration.

2. **Given Code**: 
   - `current_sum = sum(sublist)`

This line of code calculates the sum of all elements in `sublist` and assigns this sum to `current_sum`.

3. **Impact on the Program**:
   - The value of `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of the elements in `sublist`.
   - The values of `list_of_lists`, `sublist`, `max_sum`, and `max_list` are not changed by this line of code.

4. **Output State**:
   - `list_of_lists` is still a list of lists with at least 2 sublists.
   - `sublist` is still the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - `current_sum` is now equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, i.e., `current_sum = sum(sublist)`.
   - `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged as they were not updated in this iteration.

Therefore, considering the changes and the initial conditions that still apply:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, and `max_sum` and `max_list` remain the same as before this iteration.**
