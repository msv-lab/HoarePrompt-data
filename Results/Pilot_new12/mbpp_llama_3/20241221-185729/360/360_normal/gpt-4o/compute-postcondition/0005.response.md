The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`, and `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, the value of `max_sum` is now equal to the sum of all elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `sublist`, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`**
