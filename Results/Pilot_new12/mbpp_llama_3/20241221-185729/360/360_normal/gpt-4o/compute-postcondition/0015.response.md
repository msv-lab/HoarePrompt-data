The code updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` is the sum of `sublist`, which is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to the sum of `sublist`, `max_list` remains unchanged**
