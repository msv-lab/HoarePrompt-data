According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of all elements in `sublist`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 sublists and the `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is unknown (it will be calculated based on the new `sublist`), `max_sum` and `max_list` remain the same as in the previous iteration unless updated in the new iteration**
