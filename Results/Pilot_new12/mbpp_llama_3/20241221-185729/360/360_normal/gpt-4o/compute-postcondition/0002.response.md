According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is negative infinity, and `max_list` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist and `sublist` must be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
