The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function also handles negative numbers and zero-sum sublists, returning the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie. The input list remains unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric values or non-list inputs, assuming that the input is well-formed. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy of it.
