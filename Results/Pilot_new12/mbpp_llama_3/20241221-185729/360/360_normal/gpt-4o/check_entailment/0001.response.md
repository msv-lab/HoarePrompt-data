Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it successfully returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

Here is a breakdown of how the code works: 

- It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
- It then iterates through each sublist in the list of lists. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum`).
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `max_list` with the current sum and the sublist respectively.
- After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum.

The program handles all potential cases, including:
- When there is only one sublist, it returns that sublist.
- When all sublists have the same sum, it returns the first one it encounters.
- When the list of lists is empty, it returns an empty list (although this case is not explicitly handled, it will not throw an error).

In summary, the code successfully implements the problem description for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is True.
