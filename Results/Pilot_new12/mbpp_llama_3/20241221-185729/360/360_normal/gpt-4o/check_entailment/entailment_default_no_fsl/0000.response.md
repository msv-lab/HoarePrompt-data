Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it iterates over each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of the elements in the current sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. If a sublist with a higher sum is found, it updates the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist. 

The code handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, including:

- It returns the sublist with the maximum sum.
- It handles negative numbers and zero-sum sublists.
- It returns the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie.
- It does not modify the input list.
- It assumes that the input is a list of lists of numbers, which is a valid assumption given the problem statement.

The code does not include any error checking or handling, but according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the code. Therefore, based on the problem description and the source code, it appears that the code correctly implements the required functionality.
