You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist in a list of lists with the highest sum of elements. Here's why:

1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that the first sublist evaluated will have a higher sum.
2. The function then iterates over each sublist in the list of lists, calculating the sum of its elements (`current_sum = sum(sublist)`).
3. If the current sublist's sum is greater than the current max sum (`current_sum > max_sum`), the function updates `max_sum` to the current sum and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
4. After evaluating all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which holds the sublist with the highest sum.

This solution handles all potential cases, including:

* A list of lists with a single sublist.
* A list of lists where one sublist has a significantly higher sum than the others.
* A list of lists with multiple sublists having the same maximum sum (in which case the function returns the first such sublist it encounters).

Since the function correctly handles all these scenarios, and there are no obvious edge cases that it doesn't cover, it is correct. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function also handles negative numbers and zero-sum sublists, returning the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie. The input list remains unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric values or non-list inputs, assuming that the input is well-formed. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy of it.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
