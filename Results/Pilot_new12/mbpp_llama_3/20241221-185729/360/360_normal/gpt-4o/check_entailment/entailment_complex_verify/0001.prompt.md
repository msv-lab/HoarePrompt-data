You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it successfully returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

Here is a breakdown of how the code works: 

- It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
- It then iterates through each sublist in the list of lists. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum`).
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `max_list` with the current sum and the sublist respectively.
- After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum.

The program handles all potential cases, including:
- When there is only one sublist, it returns that sublist.
- When all sublists have the same sum, it returns the first one it encounters.
- When the list of lists is empty, it returns an empty list (although this case is not explicitly handled, it will not throw an error).

In summary, the code successfully implements the problem description for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is True.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists` or negative infinity if `list_of_lists` is empty, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist with the maximum sum from `list_of_lists`, or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function also handles negative numbers and zero-sum sublists, returning the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie. The input list remains unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric values or non-list inputs, assuming that the input is well-formed. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy of it.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
