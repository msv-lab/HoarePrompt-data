Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. It iterates over each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of the elements in the current sublist, and checks if it is greater than the current maximum sum. If it is, the program updates the maximum sum and stores the current sublist as the one with the maximum sum. After iterating over all sublists, the program returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* An empty input list: The program returns an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
* A list with one or more sublists: The program correctly finds the sublist with the maximum sum and returns it.
* Sublists with negative numbers or zero-sum: The program handles these cases correctly, returning the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie.
* Ties: The program returns the first sublist with the maximum sum, which is the expected behavior.

The program's assumptions about the input being valid and well-formed are also explicitly stated in the problem description, so it is not required to handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-numeric values.

Overall, the program's logic and implementation correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description, making it a correct solution.
