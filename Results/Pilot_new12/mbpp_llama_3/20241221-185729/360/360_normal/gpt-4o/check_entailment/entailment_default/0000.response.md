Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct. It iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list, which aligns with the problem description. The function also handles negative numbers and zero-sum sublists correctly, returning the first sublist with the maximum sum in case of a tie. The provided unit tests also pass, which further supports the correctness of the code. The output hints agree with the code, and the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric values or non-list inputs, but as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Overall, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description.
