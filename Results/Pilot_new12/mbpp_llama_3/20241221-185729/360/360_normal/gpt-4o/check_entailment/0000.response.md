Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist in a list of lists with the highest sum of elements. Here's why:

1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that the first sublist evaluated will have a higher sum.
2. The function then iterates over each sublist in the list of lists, calculating the sum of its elements (`current_sum = sum(sublist)`).
3. If the current sublist's sum is greater than the current max sum (`current_sum > max_sum`), the function updates `max_sum` to the current sum and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
4. After evaluating all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which holds the sublist with the highest sum.

This solution handles all potential cases, including:

* A list of lists with a single sublist.
* A list of lists where one sublist has a significantly higher sum than the others.
* A list of lists with multiple sublists having the same maximum sum (in which case the function returns the first such sublist it encounters).

Since the function correctly handles all these scenarios, and there are no obvious edge cases that it doesn't cover, it is correct. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.
