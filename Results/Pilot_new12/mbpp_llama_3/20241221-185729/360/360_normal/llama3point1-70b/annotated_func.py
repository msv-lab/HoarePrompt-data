#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of numbers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns a sublist from this list that has the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the input list or its sublists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If the sublists contain non-numeric values, the function will also raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum. The function assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least one numeric value.
