Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Functionality**: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input.
2. **Return Statement**: Inside the function, it uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`. This returns the sublist from `lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements.
3. **Handling Multiple Maximum Sums**: If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the `max` function will return one of them, which aligns with the problem description.
4. **Input Assumptions**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list of lists containing at least one numeric value each), the function will always operate as expected without encountering `ValueError` or `TypeError` exceptions.
5. **No Modification of Input**: The function does not modify the input list or its sublists; it simply returns a reference to one of the existing sublists, which meets the problem's requirements.

Since the program behaves as described in the problem statement for all potential valid inputs, and given the assumption that inputs will always be valid, the program is considered correct according to the provided problem description.
