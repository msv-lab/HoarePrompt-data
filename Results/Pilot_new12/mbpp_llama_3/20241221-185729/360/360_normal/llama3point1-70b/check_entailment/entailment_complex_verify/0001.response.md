Based on the provided code and problem description, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment, providing more details about the function's behavior.

The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the highest sum of elements. The `max` function is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which means it will return the list with the maximum sum.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function:

- Returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements
- Accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns a sublist from this list that has the maximum sum of its elements
- If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them
- The function does not modify the input list or its sublists

These points align with the problem description and the original assessment.

The original assessment correctly identifies the potential cases and their expected outcomes, such as handling empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with multiple elements, lists with negative numbers, and lists with duplicate maximum sums.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid and the function is designed to raise a `ValueError` for an empty input list and a `TypeError` for non-numeric values in the sublists, the program meets the problem description for all potential valid cases.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and based on the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
