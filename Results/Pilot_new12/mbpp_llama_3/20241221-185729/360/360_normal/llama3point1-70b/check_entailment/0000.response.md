Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `max` function with `key=sum` to find the list in the list of lists with the highest sum of elements. This approach works correctly for all cases, including empty lists and lists containing a single sublist.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

* The `max` function returns the first maximum element it encounters in case of multiple maximum values. However, this is not an issue here because we are only interested in getting any list with the highest sum, not all lists with the highest sum.
* The `key=sum` argument specifies that the `sum` function should be used to calculate the key for each list. This means that the `max` function will compare the sums of the elements in each list, which is exactly what we want.
* The function will work correctly even if the input list is empty, in which case it will raise a `ValueError` because `max` cannot be applied to an empty sequence.
* The function will also work correctly if there are multiple lists with the same highest sum, in which case it will return the first one it encounters.

Overall, the code is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
