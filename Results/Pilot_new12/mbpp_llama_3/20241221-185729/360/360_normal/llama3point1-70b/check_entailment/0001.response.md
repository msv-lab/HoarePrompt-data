Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the highest sum of elements. The `max` function is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which means it will return the list with the maximum sum.

This program works correctly for all potential cases because:

- It handles empty lists: If the input list is empty, `max` will raise a `ValueError`, which is the expected behavior in this case.
- It handles lists with a single element: If the input list contains a single list, `max` will return that list, which has the highest sum by default.
- It handles lists with multiple elements: If the input list contains multiple lists, `max` will return the list with the highest sum.
- It handles lists with negative numbers: The `sum` function works correctly with negative numbers, so the program will return the list with the highest sum even if the lists contain negative numbers.
- It handles lists with duplicate maximum sums: If there are multiple lists with the same highest sum, `max` will return the first one it encounters, which meets the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
