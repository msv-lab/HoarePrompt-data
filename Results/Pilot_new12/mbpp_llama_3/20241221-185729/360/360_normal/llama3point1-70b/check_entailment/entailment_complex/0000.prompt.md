You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of numbers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns a sublist from this list that has the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the input list or its sublists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If the sublists contain non-numeric values, the function will also raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum. The function assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least one numeric value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
