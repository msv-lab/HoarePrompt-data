Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements. 

The `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum` is used to find the sublist with the maximum sum. The `sum` function calculates the sum of each sublist, and `max` returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the function will return `[7, 8, 9]` because it has the maximum sum of elements.

This program will work correctly for any valid input, assuming that the input is a non-empty list of non-empty lists of numbers. It does not handle cases where the input is empty or not a list, but as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will always be valid. 

The program will also handle cases where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, in which case it will return the first one it encounters. However, the problem description does not specify which sublist to return in such cases, so this behavior is acceptable.
