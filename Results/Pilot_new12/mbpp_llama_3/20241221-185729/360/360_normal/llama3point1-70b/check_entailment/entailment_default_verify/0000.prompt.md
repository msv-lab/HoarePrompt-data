You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `max` function with `key=sum` to find the list in the list of lists with the highest sum of elements. This approach works correctly for all cases, including empty lists and lists containing a single sublist.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

* The `max` function returns the first maximum element it encounters in case of multiple maximum values. However, this is not an issue here because we are only interested in getting any list with the highest sum, not all lists with the highest sum.
* The `key=sum` argument specifies that the `sum` function should be used to calculate the key for each list. This means that the `max` function will compare the sums of the elements in each list, which is exactly what we want.
* The function will work correctly even if the input list is empty, in which case it will raise a `ValueError` because `max` cannot be applied to an empty sequence.
* The function will also work correctly if there are multiple lists with the same highest sum, in which case it will return the first one it encounters.

Overall, the code is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns a sublist from this list that has the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the input list or its sublists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If the sublists contain non-numeric values, the function will also raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum. The function assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least one numeric value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
