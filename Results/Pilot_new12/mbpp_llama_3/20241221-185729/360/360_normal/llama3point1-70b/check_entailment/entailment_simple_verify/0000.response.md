The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, stating that the function `func_1` uses the built-in `max` function with `key=sum` to find the list in the list of lists with the highest sum of elements. This approach is indeed correct for all cases, including multiple lists with the same highest sum and non-empty input lists.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, describing the state of the program before the function call and the return value. It states that the input `lists` is a list of lists of numbers, which aligns with the problem description. The annotation after the function call correctly notes that the program returns a sublist from `lists` with the maximum sum of its elements.

Given the information provided and analyzing the original assessment, the annotated version of the code, and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It identifies the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of elements, which is the objective specified in the problem description.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and I see no reason to change it based on the annotated version provided. The evidence from both the original assessment and the annotated version supports the correctness of the program in relation to the problem description.

Final: **True**
