Correctness: **True**

The provided code does exactly what the problem description says. It uses the built-in `max` function with `key=sum` to find the sublist in the list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

The code handles the case when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum by returning one of them, which is in line with the problem description.

It also does not modify the input list or its sublists, which is another requirement mentioned in the problem description.

The code assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least one numeric value, which is a valid assumption given the problem statement.

The potential cases where the function might not work as expected, such as an empty input list or non-numeric values in the sublists, are accounted for by the `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions that would be raised by the `max` and `sum` functions respectively.

However, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, as mentioned in the problem statement. 

Therefore, the code is correct and should work as expected for every valid input.
