Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function uses the built-in `max` function with `sum` as the key to find the sublist with the maximum sum.

This approach is correct because it directly addresses the problem statement. The `max` function with `key=sum` will iterate over all sublists, calculate the sum of each, and return the sublist with the highest sum. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max` will return one of them, which aligns with the output hints.

The output hints also indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or where sublists contain non-numeric values. However, as per the instructions, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, under the assumption of valid input, the function behaves as expected and correctly returns the sublist with the highest sum.

The code is concise, readable, and effectively solves the problem as described. It does not require any additional error checking or handling under the assumption of valid input, making it a straightforward and correct solution to the problem.
