To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state. The initial state is that `lists` is a list of lists of numbers. The code snippet is `return max(lists, key=sum)`. 

This code snippet returns the sublist from `lists` that has the maximum sum of its elements. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument compares the sublists based on the sum of their elements.

Given this information:

- `lists` is a list of lists of numbers.
- The `max` function returns the sublist with the maximum sum.
- The `key=sum` argument specifies that the sum of the elements in each sublist is used for comparison.

Therefore, the program returns a sublist from `lists` that contains numbers and has the highest sum among all sublists in `lists`.

Output State: **The program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements**
