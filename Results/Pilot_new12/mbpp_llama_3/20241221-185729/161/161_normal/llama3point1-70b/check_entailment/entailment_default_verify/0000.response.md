The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. The output hints further clarify the functionality of the code, indicating that it returns the nth number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is indeed the definition of the Lucas sequence.

Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, it's evident that the code does indeed calculate the n'th Lucas number correctly. The base cases are handled properly, and the loop calculates the subsequent numbers in the sequence as expected.

The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the code aligns perfectly with the definition of the Lucas sequence and the output hints provided. The function correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number for any given non-negative integer n.

The output hints also validate the correctness of the function by describing its behavior for different values of n. The hints state that the function returns 2 when n is 0, 1 when n is 1, and the nth number in the sequence for any other positive integer n greater than 1, which is consistent with the definition of the Lucas sequence.

Therefore, based on the provided code, the output hints, and the problem description, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
