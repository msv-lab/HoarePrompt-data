You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct for all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number using an iterative approach. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:
- It correctly handles the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1, where the Lucas numbers are 2 and 1, respectively.
- For n > 1, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the Lucas numbers up to the n'th number.
- The update logic `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` is correct, as each Lucas number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values.
- The function returns the n'th Lucas number correctly.

The provided program does not have any apparent edge cases or inputs for which it would produce incorrect results. It correctly follows the recursive formula for Lucas numbers, which is:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Since the program accurately implements this formula and handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 2. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. For any other positive integer `n` greater than 1, the function returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function covers all non-negative integer cases for `n` and does not modify the input variable `n`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns a specific integer value determined by the input `n`, without altering the original input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
