Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1. However, the Lucas sequence has a different recurrence relation than the Fibonacci sequence. The Lucas sequence is defined as: L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1.

The provided code implements the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the Lucas sequence. This means that the code does not correctly calculate the n'th Lucas number for all cases.

For example, the 2nd Lucas number is L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3, but the code will return 3 which is actually correct for the Lucas sequence but this is just luck and the code still does not follow the problem description for all cases, it just happens to be correct for some.

To correctly implement the Lucas sequence, the code should use the recurrence relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1, not just use the Fibonacci sequence formula. 

Note that if the problem description was asking to find the n'th Fibonacci number starting with 2 and 1, then the code would be correct. However, the problem description specifically asks for the Lucas sequence, which has a different definition.
