You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the difference being that the first two numbers in the sequence are 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. **Base cases**: The function handles the base cases correctly, where `n == 0` returns 2 and `n == 1` returns 1, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Recursive case**: For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). Then, it iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two calculated Lucas numbers.

3. **Return value**: After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned by the function.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including the base cases and the recursive case, and returns the expected result, it is considered correct.

To verify the correctness, you can test the function with different inputs, such as:

* `func_1(0)` should return 2
* `func_1(1)` should return 1
* `func_1(2)` should return 3 (since 2 + 1 = 3)
* `func_1(3)` should return 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4)

All these test cases should pass, indicating that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 2. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. For any other positive integer `n` greater than 1, the function returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function covers all non-negative integer cases for `n` and does not modify the input variable `n`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns a specific integer value determined by the input `n`, without altering the original input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
