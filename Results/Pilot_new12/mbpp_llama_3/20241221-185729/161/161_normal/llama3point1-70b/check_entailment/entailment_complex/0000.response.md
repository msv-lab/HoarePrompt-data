Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function to find the n'th Lucas number. 

The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and for n greater than 1, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 

The program correctly handles this by:

- Returning 2 when n is 0, which is the first number in the Lucas sequence.
- Returning 1 when n is 1, which is the second number in the Lucas sequence.
- Using a loop to calculate the nth Lucas number for n greater than 1, by iteratively updating the last two numbers in the sequence.

Since the program correctly calculates the nth Lucas number for all non-negative integer values of n, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
