Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the difference being that the first two numbers in the sequence are 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. **Base cases**: The function handles the base cases correctly, where `n == 0` returns 2 and `n == 1` returns 1, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Recursive case**: For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). Then, it iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two calculated Lucas numbers.

3. **Return value**: After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned by the function.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including the base cases and the recursive case, and returns the expected result, it is considered correct.

To verify the correctness, you can test the function with different inputs, such as:

* `func_1(0)` should return 2
* `func_1(1)` should return 1
* `func_1(2)` should return 3 (since 2 + 1 = 3)
* `func_1(3)` should return 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4)

All these test cases should pass, indicating that the function is correct.
