Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct for all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number using an iterative approach. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:
- It correctly handles the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1, where the Lucas numbers are 2 and 1, respectively.
- For n > 1, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the Lucas numbers up to the n'th number.
- The update logic `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` is correct, as each Lucas number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values.
- The function returns the n'th Lucas number correctly.

The provided program does not have any apparent edge cases or inputs for which it would produce incorrect results. It correctly follows the recursive formula for Lucas numbers, which is:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

Since the program accurately implements this formula and handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.
