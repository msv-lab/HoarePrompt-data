Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. However, the problem description specifically asks for the nth Lucas number, not the nth Fibonacci-like number starting with 2 and 1.

The Lucas sequence is defined as: L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1. The given program implements this sequence correctly for n >= 0, but the sequence generated is actually the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the standard Lucas sequence. 

A correct implementation of the Lucas sequence would be similar, but with no offset in the calculation of the nth number, and it should be noted that the provided program does indeed calculate the correct nth number for the sequence it implements, it just does not implement the standard Lucas sequence. 

To make the program calculate the nth Lucas number correctly according to the standard definition, no change is needed in the given code, but the problem description should be adjusted to reflect that the sequence starts with 2 and 1. However, based on the given problem description, the code does not calculate the nth Lucas number as typically defined in mathematics.
