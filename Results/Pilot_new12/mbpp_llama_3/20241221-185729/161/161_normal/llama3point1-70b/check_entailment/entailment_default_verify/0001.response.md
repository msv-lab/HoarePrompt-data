The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number, and the provided code, `func_1(n)`, correctly calculates this using an iterative approach. The base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` are handled correctly with return values of 2 and 1, respectively, which are the starting values of the Lucas sequence.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all non-negative integer inputs `n`, returning the correct value based on the definition of Lucas numbers. The hints state that for `n > 1`, the function returns the nth number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is a definition of the Lucas sequence.

Moreover, the provided code correctly follows the formula for Lucas numbers:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The implementation is iterative and efficiently calculates the n'th Lucas number without unnecessary recursive function calls, and it does so without modifying the input variable `n`.

The assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-negative integer) is reasonable, given the problem statement does not specify handling invalid inputs. Under this assumption, the program is indeed correct as it meets the problem description and the output hints confirm its expected behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided information, including the problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints, the program is correct in its implementation of finding the n'th Lucas number.

Final: **True**
