Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number.
2. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
3. The provided program implements this correctly:
   - For `n == 0`, it returns 2, which is the 0th Lucas number.
   - For `n == 1`, it returns 1, which is the 1st Lucas number.
   - For `n > 1`, it initializes `a` and `b` to 2 and 1, respectively, and then iteratively calculates the next Lucas number by updating `a` and `b` in each iteration.
4. The program correctly handles all non-negative integer values of `n` and returns the corresponding Lucas number.

Since the program correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation for all non-negative integer inputs, it meets the problem description requirements.
