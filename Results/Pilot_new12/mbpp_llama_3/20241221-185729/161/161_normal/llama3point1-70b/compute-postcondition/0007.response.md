According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer and not equal to 1, it implies that `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute, `n` being greater than 1 is sufficient because the loop starts from 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
