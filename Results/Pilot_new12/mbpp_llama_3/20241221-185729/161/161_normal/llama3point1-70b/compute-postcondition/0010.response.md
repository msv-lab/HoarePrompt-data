The values of `a` and `b` are updated. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 3. The new value of `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4. The state of `n` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
