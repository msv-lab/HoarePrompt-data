To determine the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the given code. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, and `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 2 and 1, so it proceeds as 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, and so on.

Given the code `return b`, we are returning the nth number in this specific Fibonacci sequence.

Output State: **The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.**
