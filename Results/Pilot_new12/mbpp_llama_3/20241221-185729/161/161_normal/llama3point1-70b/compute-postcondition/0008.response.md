The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b` by simultaneously assigning `b` to `a` and `a + b` to `b`. 

Given the initial state, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. After executing the code, `a` becomes 1 (the original value of `b`) and `b` becomes 3 (which is `a + b` or 2 + 1).

The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
