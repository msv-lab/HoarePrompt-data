Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 2. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. For any other positive integer `n` greater than 1, the function returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function covers all non-negative integer cases for `n` and does not modify the input variable `n`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns a specific integer value determined by the input `n`, without altering the original input.**
