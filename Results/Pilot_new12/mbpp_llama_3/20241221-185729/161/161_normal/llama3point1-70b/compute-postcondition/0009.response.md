To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for _ in range(2, n + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop body. The loop's execution depends solely on the value of `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is 3. Since the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n`, and given that `n` is greater than 1, the loop has started and is currently at the first iteration (where `_` would be 2, but its value is not directly relevant to the state description).

For the loop to execute again, the current value of `_` (which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as starting at 2 and incrementing) must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1 and the loop starts at 2, the next iteration would occur when `_` is 3, implying that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

The values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by the loop condition, so they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time would be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
