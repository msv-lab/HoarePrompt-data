The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, we can calculate the new values of `a` and `b`. 

- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 4.
- The new value of `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 3 + 4 = 7.

The state of `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**
