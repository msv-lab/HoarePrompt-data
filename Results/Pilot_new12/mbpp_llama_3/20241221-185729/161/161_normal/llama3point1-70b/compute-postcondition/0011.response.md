According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If the loop counter is less than `n + 1` and greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. The loop counter starts at 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 4. The loop counter must increase by 1 for the loop to execute again. Since it executed when the counter was 2, and now it needs to execute when the counter is 3 for the loop to execute one more time, and since `a` and `b` do not affect the loop execution, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again when the counter is 3 and then 4.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
