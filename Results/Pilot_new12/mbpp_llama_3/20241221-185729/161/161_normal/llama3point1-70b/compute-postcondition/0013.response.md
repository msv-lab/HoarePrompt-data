To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
This is a Fibonacci sequence generation loop, where `a` and `b` are the last two numbers in the sequence.

From the initial state, we know that `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is 2, and `b` is 1.

Looking at the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can see a pattern:
- After 1 iteration, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3, which corresponds to the second and third numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3,...).
- After 2 iterations, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4, which does not directly follow the standard Fibonacci sequence but indicates the values after swapping and adding in the loop.
- After 3 iterations, `a` is 4 and `b` is 7, again following the modified Fibonacci pattern due to the initial values of `a` and `b`.

However, considering the standard Fibonacci sequence and the initial values provided, we must correct our understanding based on the loop's operation:
- Initially, `a` = 2 and `b` = 1.
- The loop starts from 2 (since `range(2, n + 1)`), implying the sequence generation begins from the third term in a Fibonacci-like sequence, given the initial `a` and `b`.

Let's re-evaluate the loop's effect:
- The first iteration (for `_ = 2`), `a, b = b, a + b` results in `a, b = 1, 3`.
- The second iteration (for `_ = 3`), `a, b = b, a + b` results in `a, b = 3, 4`.
- The third iteration (for `_ = 4`), `a, b = b, a + b` results in `a, b = 4, 7`.

Given this pattern and understanding that the loop generates a Fibonacci-like sequence starting from the initial values of `a` and `b`, and considering the loop executes from 2 to `n` (inclusive), we can infer the final state.

The loop will execute `n - 1` times (since it starts from 2 and goes up to `n`), modifying `a` and `b` at each step to hold the last two numbers in this sequence.

Thus, after all iterations, `a` and `b` will hold the `(n-1)`th and `n`th numbers in this modified Fibonacci sequence, given the initial `a = 2` and `b = 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.**
