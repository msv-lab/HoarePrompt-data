The values of `a` and `b` are updated. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. After the update, `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 1, and `b` becomes the old value of `a` plus the old value of `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3. The value of `n` is not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
