The value of `b` is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence that starts with 2 and 1. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, we know that `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `b` is at least the 4th Fibonacci number in this sequence.

In this sequence, the first few Fibonacci numbers would be: 2, 1, 3 (which is 2 + 1), 4 (which is 1 + 3), and so on.

Given that `a` is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number and `b` is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number, `b` is the sum of `a` and the nth Fibonacci number. However, the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the value of `n`, but `b` will always be the next number in the sequence after `a`.

Output State: **The program returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.**
