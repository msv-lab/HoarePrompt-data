According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is 3. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, but its value is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop has already executed once, the value of `_` must be 3. For the loop to execute again, the value of `_` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
