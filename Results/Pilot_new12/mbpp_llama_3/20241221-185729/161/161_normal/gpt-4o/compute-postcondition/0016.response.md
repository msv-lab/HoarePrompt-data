Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following conditions: 
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the function calculates and returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in the same sequence.
After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows: 
- The input parameter `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the function.
- The function returns a specific integer value based on the conditions stated above, which can be used by the caller for further processing or output.
The function covers all potential edge cases for non-negative integer inputs, including the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and the recursive case for `n > 1` through iteration, ensuring that the Fibonacci sequence is correctly calculated according to the defined sequence starting with 2 and 1.**
