The code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. 

After executing the code, `a` becomes equal to the initial value of `b`, which is 4. 
The new value of `b` is the sum of the initial `a` and the initial `b`, which is 3 + 4 = 7.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**
