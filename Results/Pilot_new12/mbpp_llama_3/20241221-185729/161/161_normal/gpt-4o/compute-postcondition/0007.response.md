According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer and not equal to 1, it satisfies this condition. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used in the loop body, so we don't need to assign a specific value to it. However, we should note that the loop will start from 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
