Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the n'th Lucas number as described in the problem description. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. However, the program provided is actually calculating the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the n'th Lucas number.

A correct implementation of the n'th Lucas number should start with the base cases `L(0) = 2` and `L(1) = 1`, and then use the recursive formula `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)` for `n > 1`. The provided program does not follow this formula correctly.

To correctly implement the n'th Lucas number, the program should be modified as follows:

```python
def lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This modified program correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. The original program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and therefore has a correctness of **False**.
