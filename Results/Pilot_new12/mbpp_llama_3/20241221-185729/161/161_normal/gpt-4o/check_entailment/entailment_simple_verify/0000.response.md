To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code, including the annotated version, let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number. Lucas numbers are similar to Fibonacci numbers but start with 2 and 1.

2. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the function `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies that the function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` properly, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two Lucas numbers. For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to calculate the next Lucas number by adding the previous two, mirroring the standard method for generating Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.

3. **Annotated Version**: The annotated version provides insight into the state of the program at different points. Specifically, after the loop finishes executing, it states that `a` is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number and `b` is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, for `n > 1`. However, upon closer inspection, this description slightly misrepresents what `a` and `b` hold after the loop. Given the context, `a` and `b` actually represent the (n-1)th and nth Lucas numbers, respectively, at the end of the loop, considering the Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1.

Given this analysis, the confusion in the annotated version's description of `a` and `b` does not align perfectly with the standard definition of Lucas numbers or the typical Fibonacci sequence. The key insight, however, is recognizing that the function calculates Lucas numbers based on the iterative addition of the two preceding numbers, which is correct for both Fibonacci and Lucas sequences, with the only difference being the starting values.

**Reasoning for Conclusion**:

- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the Lucas numbers for any given non-negative integer `n`.
- The base cases (`n = 0` and `n = 1`) are handled correctly, returning the first two Lucas numbers.
- For `n > 1`, the iterative approach correctly generates the Lucas numbers based on the addition of the two preceding ones.
- The slight discrepancy in the annotated version's description of `a` and `b` after the loop does not affect the overall correctness of the function in calculating Lucas numbers.

**Final Assessment**:

Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation of the n'th Lucas number. The original assessment's conclusion that the function is correct is supported by the code's proper handling of base cases and its iterative approach to generating Lucas numbers for `n > 1`.

Final: **True**
