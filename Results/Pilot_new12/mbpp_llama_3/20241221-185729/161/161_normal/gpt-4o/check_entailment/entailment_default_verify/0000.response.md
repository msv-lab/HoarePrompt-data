The original assessment claims that the provided function `func_1` is correct and implements a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different set of starting values, where the first two Lucas numbers are 2 and 1.

The function `func_1` correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence. For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next Lucas number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence.

However, upon closer examination of the provided output hints, it appears that the function actually calculates the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 2 and 1. But the standard definition of the Lucas sequence and Fibonacci sequence differs in the starting indices and values.

Given the information from the output hints, the function `func_1` seems to correctly calculate the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the n'th Lucas number as stated in the problem description. 

Thus, based on the problem description asking for the n'th Lucas number, and the output hints indicating that the function calculates the (n+2)th Fibonacci number, the original assessment is not accurate.

Final: **False**
