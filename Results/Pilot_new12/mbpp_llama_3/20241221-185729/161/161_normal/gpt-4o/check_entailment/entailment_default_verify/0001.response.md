The original assessment is mostly accurate and makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does implement a function to find the n'th Lucas number, and it correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`. For `n > 1`, the code uses an iterative approach to calculate the `n`-th Lucas number, which is correct.

The output hints also support the original assessment, as they accurately describe the conditions under which the function returns specific values. The hints also note that the function calculates the `(n+2)`th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is equivalent to the `n`-th Lucas number. This is consistent with the problem description and the provided code.

One minor point to note is that the original assessment mentions that the function does not include any error checking for non-integer or negative inputs. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will be a valid non-negative integer. Therefore, this is not a concern in this case.

Based on the output hints, the program, and the reasoning, I agree with the original assessment. The program appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number, and the output hints support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
