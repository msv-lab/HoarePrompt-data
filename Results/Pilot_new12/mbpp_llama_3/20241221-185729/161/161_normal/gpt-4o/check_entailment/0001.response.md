Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the difference being that it starts with 2 and 1, rather than 0 and 1. 

In the given code, the base cases are handled correctly for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, where the function returns 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence. 

For `n > 1`, the code uses an iterative approach with a loop to calculate the `n`-th Lucas number. It maintains two variables `a` and `b` to store the last two numbers in the sequence and updates them in each iteration. 

After checking several potential cases, the function seems to produce the correct results for the given inputs, and there's no apparent missing logic or edge case that the code is not handling. Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code and problem description, it appears to be correct. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking for non-integer or negative inputs, which might be a consideration depending on how the function is intended to be used in practice. But based strictly on the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to be correct.
