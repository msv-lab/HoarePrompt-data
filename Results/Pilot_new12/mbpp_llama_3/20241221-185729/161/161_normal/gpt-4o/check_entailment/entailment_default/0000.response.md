Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should find the n'th Lucas number. However, the code actually calculates the (n+1)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is not equivalent to the Lucas sequence. 

In the Lucas sequence, the first two numbers are 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The code correctly implements this sequence, but it does so for the (n+1)th number, not the n'th number. This is evident from the loop range, which starts at 2 and goes up to n+1, effectively calculating the (n+1)th number in the sequence.

For example, when n is 0, the function correctly returns 2, which is the first Lucas number. However, when n is 1, the function returns 1, which is the second Lucas number, and when n is 2, the function returns 3, which is the third Lucas number. This suggests that the function is actually calculating the (n+1)th Lucas number, not the n'th Lucas number.

To fix this, the loop range should be adjusted to start at 2 and go up to n, effectively calculating the n'th number in the sequence. However, as the code is currently written, it does not correctly implement the problem description, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
