Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number, but the provided function actually calculates the (n+1)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the Lucas number.

The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 2 and 1. The sequence begins like this: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76,... 

However, the provided function returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is not the same as the Lucas number.

For example, the 5th Lucas number is 11, but the function `func_1(5)` returns the 7th Fibonacci number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is 18. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
