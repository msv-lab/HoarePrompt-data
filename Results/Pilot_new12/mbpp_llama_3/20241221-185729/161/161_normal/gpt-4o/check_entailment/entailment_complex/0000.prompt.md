You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number (where the sequence starts with 2 and 1), and `b` is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number (in the same sequence).
            return b
            #The program returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following conditions: 
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the function calculates and returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in the same sequence.
After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows: 
- The input parameter `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the function.
- The function returns a specific integer value based on the conditions stated above, which can be used by the caller for further processing or output.
The function covers all potential edge cases for non-negative integer inputs, including the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and the recursive case for `n > 1` through iteration, ensuring that the Fibonacci sequence is correctly calculated according to the defined sequence starting with 2 and 1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
