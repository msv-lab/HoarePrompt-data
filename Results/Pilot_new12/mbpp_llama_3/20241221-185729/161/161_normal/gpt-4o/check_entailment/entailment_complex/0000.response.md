Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it calculates the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, not the n'th Lucas number.

The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1. To calculate the n'th Lucas number, we need to adjust the Fibonacci sequence calculation to account for the correct starting values and indexing.

In this case, the function returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is not the same as the n'th Lucas number.

For example, the correct values for the Lucas sequence are:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 3 (2 + 1)
- L(3) = 4 (3 + 1)
- L(4) = 7 (4 + 3)
- L(5) = 11 (7 + 4)
- L(6) = 18 (11 + 7)
- L(7) = 29 (18 + 11)
- L(8) = 47 (29 + 18)
- L(9) = 76 (47 + 29)

The function provided does not calculate the n'th Lucas number correctly for all values of n. It calculates the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is not the same as the n'th Lucas number.

To fix this, the function should be adjusted to return the (n+1)th Fibonacci number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1, or recalculate the sequence to correctly calculate the n'th Lucas number. 

The correct function should be:
```python
def lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
```
