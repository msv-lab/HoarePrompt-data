You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different set of starting values. 

The function correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next Lucas number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence, which is the standard method for generating Lucas numbers.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7`, suggest that the function works correctly for various inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles the generation of Lucas numbers for any non-negative integer `n`. 

The function also seems to be efficient as it uses a simple iterative approach with a time complexity of O(n), which is the best that can be achieved for this problem since we need to calculate each Lucas number up to the n'th number. 

Therefore, the provided function `func_1` appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number (where the sequence starts with 2 and 1), and `b` is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number (in the same sequence).
            return b
            #The program returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following conditions: 
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the function calculates and returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in the same sequence.
After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows: 
- The input parameter `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the function.
- The function returns a specific integer value based on the conditions stated above, which can be used by the caller for further processing or output.
The function covers all potential edge cases for non-negative integer inputs, including the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and the recursive case for `n > 1` through iteration, ensuring that the Fibonacci sequence is correctly calculated according to the defined sequence starting with 2 and 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
