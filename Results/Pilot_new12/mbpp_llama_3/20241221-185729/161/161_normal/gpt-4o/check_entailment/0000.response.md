Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different set of starting values. 

The function correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next Lucas number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence, which is the standard method for generating Lucas numbers.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7`, suggest that the function works correctly for various inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles the generation of Lucas numbers for any non-negative integer `n`. 

The function also seems to be efficient as it uses a simple iterative approach with a time complexity of O(n), which is the best that can be achieved for this problem since we need to calculate each Lucas number up to the n'th number. 

Therefore, the provided function `func_1` appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number.
