The original assessment claims that the provided function `func_1` is a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. However, upon analyzing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the function actually calculates the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1 for n > 1, not the n'th Lucas number.

According to the problem description, a function to find the n'th Lucas number should return the n'th number in the Lucas sequence, which starts with 2 and 1. However, the provided function returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number for n > 1, which is not the same as the n'th Lucas number.

The annotated version of the code clearly states that after the for loop, `b` is the (n+2)th Fibonacci number, which is then returned by the function. This means that the function is not correctly implementing the Lucas sequence.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is not accurate.

Final: **False**
