You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to be a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the difference being that it starts with 2 and 1, rather than 0 and 1. 

In the given code, the base cases are handled correctly for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, where the function returns 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence. 

For `n > 1`, the code uses an iterative approach with a loop to calculate the `n`-th Lucas number. It maintains two variables `a` and `b` to store the last two numbers in the sequence and updates them in each iteration. 

After checking several potential cases, the function seems to produce the correct results for the given inputs, and there's no apparent missing logic or edge case that the code is not handling. Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided code and problem description, it appears to be correct. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking for non-integer or negative inputs, which might be a consideration depending on how the function is intended to be used in practice. But based strictly on the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following conditions: 
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 2.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the function calculates and returns the (n+2)th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is the sum of the (n+1)th and the nth Fibonacci numbers in the same sequence.
After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows: 
- The input parameter `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the function.
- The function returns a specific integer value based on the conditions stated above, which can be used by the caller for further processing or output.
The function covers all potential edge cases for non-negative integer inputs, including the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, and the recursive case for `n > 1` through iteration, ensuring that the Fibonacci sequence is correctly calculated according to the defined sequence starting with 2 and 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
