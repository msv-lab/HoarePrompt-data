Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the correctness of the program can be evaluated as follows:

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it provides a valid reasoning for this conclusion. The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment by describing the states of the program at different points and ensuring that the function behaves as expected.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the function `func_1` does not actually calculate the `n`-th Lucas number as intended. According to the problem description and the original assessment, the Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, but the function actually calculates the `(n+2)`-th Lucas number when `n` is greater than 1, not the `n`-th Lucas number.

The annotated version of the code correctly notes that when `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the function calculates and returns the `(n+2)`-th Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1. This discrepancy between the intended behavior (calculating the `n`-th Lucas number) and the actual behavior (calculating the `(n+2)`-th Lucas number) means that the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate. The correct assessment should be that the program does not meet the problem description.

Final: **False**
