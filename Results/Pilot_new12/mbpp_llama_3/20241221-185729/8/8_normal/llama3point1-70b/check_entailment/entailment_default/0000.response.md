Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The function uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last occurrences of the character, respectively. If the character appears more than once in the string, it removes the first and last occurrences by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the characters at those positions), and after the last occurrence. If the character appears only once in the string, it removes the single occurrence using the `replace` method with a count of 1. If the character does not appear in the string, it returns the original string.

The output hints agree with the code and describe the functionality accurately. The function handles edge cases where the character is not found in the string or appears only once, and it correctly handles the case where the character appears multiple times in the string.

The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, or the single occurrence if the character appears only once, and returns the original string if the character is not found. The function does not have any apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, and the output hints support its correctness.
