Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to correctly implement the function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

Here is why I think the code is correct:

- It correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the character using the `find` and `rfind` methods.
- If both occurrences are found, it handles the cases where the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once) and where they are different separately.
- If the character is not found in the string, it simply returns the original string.
- The program does not modify the original string, but returns a new string with the first and last occurrences of the character removed.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The code handles edge cases, such as when the character appears only once or not at all, and when the character appears multiple times. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
