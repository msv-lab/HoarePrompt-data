Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: If the character appears more than once in the string, the program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences using `find()` and `rfind()` methods. It then returns a new string that concatenates the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at these positions), and after the last occurrence. This effectively removes the first and last occurrences of the character.

2. **Handling Single Occurrence**: If the character appears only once in the string, both `find()` and `rfind()` will return the same index. In this case, the program uses the `replace()` method with a count of 1 to remove the single occurrence of the character. This aligns with the problem description, which requires removing the first and last occurrences, even if they are the same.

3. **Handling Non-Existing Character**: Although the problem statement assumes the character exists at least twice in the string, the program also correctly handles the case where the character does not exist in the string. In such a scenario, both `find()` and `rfind()` will return -1, and the program will return the original string, as specified in the problem description for the edge case where the character is not found.

The given program strictly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, it is correct.
