You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character that exists at least twice in s.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns a string where the first occurrence of `char` has been removed, resulting in a modified version of `s`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, `char` is a character that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns string `s` that contains at least one character `char` which appears at least twice, with `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` indices associated with `char` in `s`, where either or both of these indices can be -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `char` as input, and returns a modified string based on the occurrence of `char` in `s`. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s` and returns the resulting string. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it removes the single occurrence of `char` from `s` and returns the resulting string. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns the original string `s`. The function handles edge cases where `char` is not found in `s` or appears only once, and it correctly handles the case where `char` appears multiple times in `s`. After executing the function, the resulting string will have the first and last occurrences of `char` removed if `char` appears more than once, or the single occurrence of `char` removed if `char` appears only once, or will be the original string `s` if `char` is not found in `s`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
