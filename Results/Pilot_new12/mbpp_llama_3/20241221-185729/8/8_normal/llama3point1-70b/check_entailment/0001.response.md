Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function appears to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

Here's why it works correctly:

- The function `func_1(s, char)` takes two parameters: `s` (the input string) and `char` (the character to be removed).

- It uses the `find()` method to get the index of the first occurrence of `char` and the `rfind()` method to get the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

- If `char` is found in `s` (i.e., both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not -1), it checks if the first and last occurrence are the same. If they are, it removes only one occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.

- If the first and last occurrence are different, it constructs a new string that excludes both the first and the last occurrence of `char` using slicing.

- If `char` is not found in `s`, it simply returns the original string `s`.

All potential cases seem to be handled:

- If the character appears more than once, the first and last occurrences are correctly removed.
- If the character appears only once, only one occurrence is removed, which is the correct interpretation of removing both the first and last occurrence when they are the same.
- If the character does not appear in the string, the original string is returned unchanged.

Since all these cases are correctly handled and no potential case where the program does not work as described can be identified, the program is considered correct.
