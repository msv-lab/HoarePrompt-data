Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The function handles multiple edge cases, including when the character appears more than once, only once, or not at all in the string.

1. **Multiple Occurrences:** When the character appears more than once, the function correctly identifies the first and last occurrences using `find()` and `rfind()` methods, respectively. It then constructs a new string that excludes these occurrences by concatenating substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character at these positions), and after the last occurrence.

2. **Single Occurrence:** If the character appears only once, `find()` and `rfind()` will return the same index. The function handles this case by using the `replace()` method with a count of 1, effectively removing the single occurrence of the character.

3. **No Occurrences:** If the character does not appear in the string, both `find()` and `rfind()` return -1. The function checks for this condition and returns the original string unchanged.

Given the problem description and the code implementation, the function correctly handles all specified cases without any identified gaps in logic or missing edge cases for the accepted input types (a string and a character). The output hints provided match the expected behavior of the function based on its implementation, indicating that the function behaves as described for various scenarios of character occurrence in the string. 

Therefore, based on the analysis and assuming valid inputs (a non-empty string and a single character), the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
