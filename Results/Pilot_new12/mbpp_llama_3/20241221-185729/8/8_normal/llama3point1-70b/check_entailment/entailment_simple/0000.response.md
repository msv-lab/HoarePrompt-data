Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s, char)` meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the character `char` in the string `s` using the `find()` and `rfind()` methods, respectively.
2. It checks if both occurrences are found, and if not, it returns the original string `s`. This is correct because if the character is not found at least twice, there's nothing to remove.
3. If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it removes only the first occurrence using the `replace()` method with a count of 1. This is correct because there's only one occurrence to remove.
4. If the first and last occurrences are different, it uses string slicing to remove both occurrences and returns the resulting string. This is correct because it removes the first and last occurrences of the character.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the character appears at least twice in the string.
* When the character appears only once in the string.
* When the character is not found in the string (although this case is not explicitly tested, the program will still return the original string).

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
