The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `char` as input, and returns a modified string based on the occurrence of `char` in `s`. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s` and returns the resulting string. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it removes the single occurrence of `char` from `s` and returns the resulting string. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns the original string `s`. The function handles edge cases where `char` is not found in `s` or appears only once, and it correctly handles the case where `char` appears multiple times in `s`. After executing the function, the resulting string will have the first and last occurrences of `char` removed if `char` appears more than once, or the single occurrence of `char` removed if `char` appears only once, or will be the original string `s` if `char` is not found in `s`.
