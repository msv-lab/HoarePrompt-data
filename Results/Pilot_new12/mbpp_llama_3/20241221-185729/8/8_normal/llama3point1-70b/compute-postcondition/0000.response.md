The code `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` to the variable `first_occurrence`. Since `char` exists at least twice in `s`, the `find` method will return the index of the first occurrence of `char`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`, and `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`, and `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.**
