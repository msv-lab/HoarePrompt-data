The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. `s` is a string, and `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`. 

The function has three possible return cases:
1. It returns a string where the first occurrence of `char` has been removed from `s`.
2. It returns a string where both the first and last occurrences of `char` have been removed from `s`.
3. It returns the original string `s` with `char` appearing at least twice.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `char`, and return a modified string based on the occurrence of `char` in `s`, which can be either `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed, `s` with both the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, or the original string `s`.
