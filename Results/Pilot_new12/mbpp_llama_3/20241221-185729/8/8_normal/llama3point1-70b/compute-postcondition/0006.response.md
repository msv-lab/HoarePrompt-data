To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state. The initial state provides that `s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` (not -1), and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` (not -1), with `first_occurrence` not equal to `last_occurrence`, indicating `char` appears more than once.

The code snippet is:
```
return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
```
This line of code returns a modified version of string `s`. Here's how it works:

1. `s[:first_occurrence]` returns all characters in `s` before the first occurrence of `char`.
2. `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]` returns all characters in `s` between the first and last occurrences of `char`, excluding the first occurrence (since we start from `first_occurrence + 1`) and the last occurrence (since we end at `last_occurrence`, not `last_occurrence + 1`).
3. `s[last_occurrence + 1:]` returns all characters in `s` after the last occurrence of `char`.

By concatenating these three parts, the code effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`.

Given the initial state, `char` has more than one occurrence in `s`, and both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not -1 and not equal to each other. This means `char` is successfully found and removed from its first and last positions in `s`.

Output State: **The program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, `char` is a character that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.**
