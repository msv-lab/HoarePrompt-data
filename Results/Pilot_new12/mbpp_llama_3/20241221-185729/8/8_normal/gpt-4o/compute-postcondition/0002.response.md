Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, the current value of `ch` exists at least twice in `s` or it does not exist at all in `s`. `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, the current value of `first_index` is either -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`) or it has a value corresponding to the first occurrence of `ch`. `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, the current value of `last_index` is either -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`) or it has a value corresponding to the last occurrence of `ch`. Additionally, either `ch` does not exist in `s` (resulting in `first_index` or `last_index` being -1) or `ch` exists only once in `s` (resulting in `first_index` being equal to `last_index`).**
