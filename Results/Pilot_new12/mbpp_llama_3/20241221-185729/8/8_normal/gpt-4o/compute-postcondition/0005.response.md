To determine the output state, let's break down the given return statement and the initial state.

The return statement is `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string.
- `ch` is a single character string that exists at least twice in `s`.
- `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
- `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
- `first_index` is not -1, `last_index` is not -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`.

The return statement essentially removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` because:
- `s[:first_index]` gets all characters before the first occurrence of `ch`.
- `s[first_index + 1:last_index]` gets all characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch`, excluding the first occurrence (by starting at `first_index + 1`) but including everything up to the last occurrence (since `last_index` is exclusive in slicing).
- `s[last_index + 1:]` gets all characters after the last occurrence of `ch`.

Thus, the program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.

Output State: **The program returns a string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of character `ch` removed.**
