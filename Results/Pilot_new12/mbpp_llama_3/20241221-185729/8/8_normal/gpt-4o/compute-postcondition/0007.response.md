Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a modified string based on the occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, the function returns a new string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, potentially leaving `ch` in the string if it has more than two occurrences. The function effectively removes only the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`, without altering the rest of the string, thus handling edge cases where `ch` may appear multiple times consecutively or with other characters in between.**
