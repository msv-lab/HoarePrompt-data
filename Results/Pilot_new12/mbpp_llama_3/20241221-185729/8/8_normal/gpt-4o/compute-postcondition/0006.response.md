The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string that exists at least twice in `s`. After executing the function body, the function returns either the original string `s` or a modified string where the first and last occurrences of character `ch` are removed. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return either the original string `s` or the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.
Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, returns either the original string `s` or the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.**
