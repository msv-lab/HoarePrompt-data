The code `first_index = s.find(ch)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` to the variable `first_index`. Since `ch` exists at least twice in `s`, the `find` method will return the index of the first occurrence of `ch`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
