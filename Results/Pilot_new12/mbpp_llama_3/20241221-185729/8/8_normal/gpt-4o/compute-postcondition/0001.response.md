The code assigns the value of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` to `last_index`. The `rfind` method returns the highest index of the substring `ch` in `s`. 

The state of `s` is still a string, the state of `ch` is still a single character string that exists at least twice in `s`, and the state of `first_index` is still the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`**
