To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides details about a string `s`, a single character string `ch`, and two indices: `first_index` and `last_index`, which are related to the occurrences of `ch` in `s`. The code simply returns the string `s`.

Given that:
- `s` is a string.
- `ch` is a single character string that either exists at least twice in `s` or does not exist at all in `s`.
- `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is -1 if `ch` is not found, or a value corresponding to the first occurrence of `ch`.
- `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is -1 if `ch` is not found, or a value corresponding to the last occurrence of `ch`.
- Either `ch` does not exist in `s`, or if it exists, it does so only once (resulting in `first_index` equaling `last_index`), but given the initial statement about `ch` existing at least twice or not at all, the scenario of `ch` existing only once seems to be a contradictory condition and may be a point of confusion. However, it's clear that if `ch` exists, it's either multiple times or not at all based on the primary condition.

The return statement `return s` implies that the program will output the string `s` as it is, without any modifications. 

Therefore, the output state will be the string `s`, with the understanding that `s` contains or does not contain the character `ch` as described, but the return statement itself does not depend on the presence or absence of `ch` in `s`.

Output State: **The program returns the string `s`, which may or may not contain the character `ch`, and if `ch` exists in `s`, it does so either multiple times or the information about its singles existence is overridden by the condition of multiple or no existence.**
