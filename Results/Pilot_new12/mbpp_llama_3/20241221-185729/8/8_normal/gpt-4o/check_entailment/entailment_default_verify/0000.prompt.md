You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string. 

After analyzing the code, it appears to handle all potential edge cases correctly:
- If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string.
- If the character appears only once in the string, it returns the string without that character.
- If the character appears multiple times in the string, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the character.

The function uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last indices of the specified character, respectively. It then checks if these indices are valid (not -1) and if they refer to the same position in the string. If the indices are valid and different, it constructs a new string by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding these occurrences), and after the last occurrence of the character. 

All provided assertions suggest that the function behaves as expected. Without finding any specific case where the function does not work according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a modified string based on the occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, the function returns a new string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, potentially leaving `ch` in the string if it has more than two occurrences. The function effectively removes only the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`, without altering the rest of the string, thus handling edge cases where `ch` may appear multiple times consecutively or with other characters in between.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
