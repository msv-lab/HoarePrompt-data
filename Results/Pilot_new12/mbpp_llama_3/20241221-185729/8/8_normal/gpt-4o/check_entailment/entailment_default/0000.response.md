Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string, while keeping any middle occurrences of the character intact. The code handles edge cases where the character appears less than twice in the string by returning the original string. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the code, as they cover different scenarios and the code passes all of them. 

For example, when the input is 'hello' and 'l', the function correctly returns 'heo'. When the input is 'abcda' and 'a', the function correctly returns 'bcd'. When the input is 'PHP' and 'P', the function correctly returns 'H'. 

The function correctly checks if the character appears less than twice in the string by verifying if the first_index and last_index are equal (which means the character appears only once) or if either of them is -1 (which means the character does not appear in the string at all). In such cases, it returns the original string. 

If the character appears at least twice, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences by slicing the string and concatenating the parts before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences, and after the last occurrence. 

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem description.
