Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for cases where the character `ch` appears only twice in the string `s` and these two occurrences are next to each other. 

In the problem description, it is stated that the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, in the program, when `ch` appears only twice and these two occurrences are next to each other (i.e., `first_index + 1 == last_index`), the function returns a string that has all occurrences of `ch` removed, not just the first and last.

For example, if `s = 'abbc'` and `ch = 'b'`, the function should return `'abc'`, but the program returns `'ac'`.

To fix this, the program should be modified to handle this edge case correctly. 

Here's a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```
This function should be modified to:
```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1:
        return s
    if first_index == last_index:
        return s.replace(ch, '', 1)
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```
However, it is still not perfect because it does not handle the case when `ch` appears more than twice and the first and last occurrences are next to each other.

This version does not actually exist in the given program and this is the reason the given program is not correct according to the problem description.
