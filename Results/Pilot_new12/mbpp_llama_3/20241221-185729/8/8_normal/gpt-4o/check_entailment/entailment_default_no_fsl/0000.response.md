Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of removing the first and last occurrences of a given character `ch` from a string `s`. 

Here's why:

1. **Handles cases with less than two occurrences:** If the character `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. This is because it checks for `first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index`, and if any of these conditions are true, it returns `s` as is.

2. **Removes first and last occurrences correctly:** When `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences of `ch`. It finds the first occurrence of `ch` using `s.find(ch)` and the last occurrence using `s.rfind(ch)`. Then, it concatenates the substrings before the first occurrence, after the first occurrence but before the last occurrence, and after the last occurrence to form the new string.

3. **Preserves the rest of the string:** It maintains the original order and content of the rest of the characters in `s`, including any occurrences of `ch` that are not the first or the last.

4. **Handles edge cases:** The function correctly handles cases where `ch` appears consecutively or is separated by other characters. The use of `find` and `rfind` ensures that it correctly identifies the first and last occurrences regardless of the positions of `ch` within `s`.

Since the function behaves as specified in the problem description for all potential cases, and it handles edge cases correctly without needing additional error handling for invalid inputs (since we assume valid inputs), the code is correct.
