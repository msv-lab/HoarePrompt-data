Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string. 

After analyzing the code, it appears to handle all potential edge cases correctly:
- If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string.
- If the character appears only once in the string, it returns the string without that character.
- If the character appears multiple times in the string, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the character.

The function uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last indices of the specified character, respectively. It then checks if these indices are valid (not -1) and if they refer to the same position in the string. If the indices are valid and different, it constructs a new string by concatenating the substrings before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding these occurrences), and after the last occurrence of the character. 

All provided assertions suggest that the function behaves as expected. Without finding any specific case where the function does not work according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct.
