Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The `find` and `rfind` methods are used to find the indices of the first and last occurrences of the given character `ch` in the string `s`. 

2. If `ch` does not exist in `s`, or exists only once, the program returns the original string `s`. This is because the `find` and `rfind` methods return `-1` if the character is not found, and in the case of a single occurrence, `first_index` equals `last_index`.

3. If `ch` exists at least twice in `s`, the program removes the first and last occurrences by slicing the string `s`. The slicing operation `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` effectively removes the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

The program handles all cases correctly and does not rely on any invalid assumptions. It checks for the existence of `ch` in `s` and handles single and multiple occurrences correctly. The assertions provided also validate the correctness of the function for different input cases. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, making it correct.
