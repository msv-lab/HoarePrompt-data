Correctness: **True**

The given Python function correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

Here is a breakdown of how it works:
1. It uses the `find()` method to get the index of the first occurrence of the character.
2. It uses the `rfind()` method to get the index of the last occurrence of the character.
3. If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`), or if the first and last occurrence of the character are the same (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), the function returns the original string.
4. If the character is found and has multiple occurrences, the function returns a new string that consists of the parts of the original string before the first occurrence of the character, between the first and last occurrence (excluding the character at the first index), and after the last occurrence of the character.

This logic correctly handles all possible cases, including:
- The character is not found in the string.
- The character appears only once in the string.
- The character appears multiple times in the string.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
