You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string, and ch is a single character string that exists at least twice in s.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string `s`, which may or may not contain the character `ch`, and if `ch` exists in `s`, it does so either multiple times or the information about its singles existence is overridden by the condition of multiple or no existence.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. `first_index` is not -1, `last_index` is not -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of character `ch` removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a modified string based on the occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, the function returns a new string that is `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, potentially leaving `ch` in the string if it has more than two occurrences. The function effectively removes only the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`, without altering the rest of the string, thus handling edge cases where `ch` may appear multiple times consecutively or with other characters in between.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
