The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

The code handles edge cases such as:
- When the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string.
- When the character appears only once in the string, it returns the string without that character.
- When the character appears multiple times in the string, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the character.

The output hints provided further support this assessment, confirming that the function behaves as expected. The hints describe the function's behavior when the character appears less than twice and when it appears at least twice, which aligns with the code's implementation.

Moreover, the code does not assume any invalid inputs and does not attempt to handle cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., `ch` is not a single character or `s` is not a string), as per the problem description's constraints.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the program's correctness assessment should remain unchanged.

Final: **True**
