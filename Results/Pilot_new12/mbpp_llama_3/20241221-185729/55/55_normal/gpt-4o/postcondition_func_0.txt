The function accepts a string parameter `snake_str` and returns a new string where each word, previously separated by underscores in `snake_str`, now starts with a capital letter. The rest of the characters in each word remain unchanged, including lowercase letters, digits, and other characters. The function handles strings with one or more underscores, as well as strings with no underscores, in which case the entire string is capitalized. It also handles empty strings, returning an empty string. The function does not perform any error checking on the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a string, and it does not modify the original input string. The function's output will always be a string, regardless of the input.
