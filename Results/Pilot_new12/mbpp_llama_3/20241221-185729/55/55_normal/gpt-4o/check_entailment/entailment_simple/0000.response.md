Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it converts each word to title case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized), whereas camel case requires the first word to be in lowercase and the subsequent words to be in title case. 

In the provided unit tests, the expected outputs are not in camel case, but rather in Pascal case, which is why they match the program's output. However, if we were to test the function with the expected camel case output, it would fail.

For example, if we call `func_1('python_program')`, the function would return `'PythonProgram'`, but the expected output in camel case should be `'pythonProgram'`. 

To fix this, the function should capitalize each word except the first one. Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components[1:])
```
