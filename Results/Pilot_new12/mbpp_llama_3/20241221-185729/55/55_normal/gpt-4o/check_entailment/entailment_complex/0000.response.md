Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a conversion from snake case to camel case, where the first word should be in lowercase and the subsequent words should start with a capital letter. However, the provided function converts all words to title case (i.e., the first letter of each word is capitalized), which is not equivalent to camel case.

For example, given the input string "hello_world", the function returns "HelloWorld", whereas the correct camel case conversion would be "helloWorld". 

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to only capitalize the first letter of each word, except for the first word, which should remain in lowercase. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components[1:])
```

This revised function correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings, following the problem description.
