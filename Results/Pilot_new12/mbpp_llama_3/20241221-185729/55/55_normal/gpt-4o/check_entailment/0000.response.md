Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string starts with an underscore or has consecutive underscores, the program will not handle it correctly. 

In the case of consecutive underscores, the program will treat the empty strings between them as separate components and capitalize the next component after each of these empty strings, resulting in an incorrect output.

For instance, the input 'hello__world' will be converted to 'HelloWorld' instead of 'HelloWorld' (which might be the expected output) or 'Hello World' (which is the correct output if we consider two or more consecutive underscores as a single separator). But depending on the definition of the conversion it might be different. However, the more serious issue here is the case when the input string starts with an underscore.

If the input string starts with an underscore, for example '_hello', the program will split it into ['', 'hello'] and then join 'Hello' to the rest of the string, resulting in 'Hello' instead of the expected 'hello' (in camel case, the first letter of the first word is usually not capitalized).

Here's an example of how this issue could be handled:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    # Remove empty strings from the list of components
    components = [x for x in components if x]
    if not components:
        return ''
    # Capitalize all components except the first one
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))

```
