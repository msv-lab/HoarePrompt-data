Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically lowercase, and the subsequent words are uppercase. However, the provided function always capitalizes every word. 

For example, the function will convert 'python_program' to 'PythonProgram' instead of the correct camel case 'pythonProgram'. 

The correct implementation should make the first word lowercase and capitalize the subsequent words. The corrected function could look something like this:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
