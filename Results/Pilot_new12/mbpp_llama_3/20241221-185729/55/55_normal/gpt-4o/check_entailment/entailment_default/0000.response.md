Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the code is that it capitalizes the entire string when there are no underscores, instead of just capitalizing the first letter. According to the problem description, the function should convert a snake case string to camel case string. In camel case, the first word is not capitalized, but the subsequent words are. However, the code capitalizes the first word as well.

For example, if we input 'hello_world', the function should return 'helloWorld', but the current function will return 'HelloWorld'. 

Also, we can notice that in the unit tests provided, there are no examples where the input string does not contain underscores, so we cannot confirm if the function handles this case correctly. However, according to the description, the function should capitalize the entire string when there are no underscores, which is not what we expect in a camel case string. 

In order to fix this issue, the code should be modified to handle the case when there are no underscores, and when the string is not empty, it should not capitalize the first word. 

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
