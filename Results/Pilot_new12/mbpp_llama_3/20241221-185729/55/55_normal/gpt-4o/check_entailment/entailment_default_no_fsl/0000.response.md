Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. A camel case string typically has the first word in lowercase and subsequent words capitalized. However, the provided code capitalizes the first word as well. 

For example, the function `func_1('python_program')` returns `'PythonProgram'`, but it should return `'pythonProgram'` according to the camel case convention. 

The correct implementation should lower the case of the first word and then capitalize the rest of the words:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```
