The code `components = snake_str.split('_')` splits the string `snake_str` into a list of substrings separated by the underscore character. 

Given the initial state, `snake_str` is a string containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where an underscore is followed by an uppercase or lowercase letter. 

After executing the code, `components` is assigned the value of the list of substrings from `snake_str`. The first component will be the substring before the first underscore (or the entire string if there are no underscores), and subsequent components will be the substrings between the underscores and after the last underscore.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where an underscore is followed by an uppercase or lowercase letter; `components` is a list of substrings from `snake_str`, split at each underscore character**.
