Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The main issue is that it capitalizes the first word of the snake case string, which is not the expected behavior in camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically in lower case.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the function will return "HelloWorld", but the expected output is "helloWorld".

To fix this, the function should only capitalize the words after the first word. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
