You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The main issue is that it capitalizes the first word of the snake case string, which is not the expected behavior in camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically in lower case.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the function will return "HelloWorld", but the expected output is "helloWorld".

To fix this, the function should only capitalize the words after the first word. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str` and returns a string where the first letter of each word from the list of substrings split by '_' from the original string is capitalized, resulting in a camel case string. It handles strings with one or more words separated by underscores and capitalizes the first letter of each word, except that the annotations and the code imply the first word's first letter is also capitalized, unlike traditional camel case. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty, contains only underscores, or contains consecutive underscores, but based on the code, it will return an empty string, a string of capitalized empty strings, or a string with consecutive capitalized empty strings respectively. It also assumes that the input is a string and does not contain any error checking or handling for non-string inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
