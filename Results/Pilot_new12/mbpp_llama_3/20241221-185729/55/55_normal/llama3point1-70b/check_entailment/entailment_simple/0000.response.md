Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the conversion from snake case to camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically not capitalized, whereas the program capitalizes the first word as well.

For example, given the input string "hello_world", the program will return "HelloWorld", whereas the expected output for camel case is "helloWorld".

The correct implementation should capitalize each word except for the first one. The program's line where it capitalizes each word should be modified to exclude the first word from capitalization. 

Here's how you could implement this:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
    return camel_case_str
```

In this corrected version, the first word (`words[0]`) is added to the result without modification, and the rest of the words (`words[1:]`) are capitalized. This way, the first word remains in lowercase, and the rest are in title case, following the conventional camel case formatting.
