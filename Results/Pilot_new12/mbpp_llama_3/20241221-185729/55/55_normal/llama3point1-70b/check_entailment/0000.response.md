Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In camel case, the first word should be in lowercase, and the subsequent words should have their first letter capitalized. However, the given function capitalizes the first word as well. 

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the function will return "HelloWorld", but the correct camel case string should be "helloWorld". 

To correct this, the function should be modified to handle the first word separately, like so:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
