Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not follow the traditional camel case conversion rules. In camel case, the first word's first letter should be in lowercase, not capitalized. The current implementation capitalizes the first letter of every word, including the first one. 

For example, if the input is `hello_world`, the function will return `HelloWorld`, whereas the correct camel case conversion should be `helloWorld`. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

To fix this, the code should be modified to only capitalize the first letter of each word, except for the first word. Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    if not words:  # Handle empty string
        return ''
    camel_case_str = words[0].lower() + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
