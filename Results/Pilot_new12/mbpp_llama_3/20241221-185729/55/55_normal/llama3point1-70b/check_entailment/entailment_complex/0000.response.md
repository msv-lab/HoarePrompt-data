Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it capitalizes the first letter of every word, including the first word. However, in traditional camel case, the first word is not capitalized, only the subsequent words are capitalized.

For example, if the input string is "hello_world", the program will return "HelloWorld", whereas the correct camel case string should be "helloWorld". 

The program should be modified to not capitalize the first word, only the subsequent words, to meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
    return camel_case_str
```
