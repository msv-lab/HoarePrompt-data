You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #The program returns a string where the first letter of each word from the list of substrings split by '_' from the original string `snake_case_str` is capitalized
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str` and returns a string where the first letter of each word from the list of substrings split by '_' from the original string is capitalized, resulting in a camel case string. It handles strings with one or more words separated by underscores and capitalizes the first letter of each word, except that the annotations and the code imply the first word's first letter is also capitalized, unlike traditional camel case. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty, contains only underscores, or contains consecutive underscores, but based on the code, it will return an empty string, a string of capitalized empty strings, or a string with consecutive capitalized empty strings respectively. It also assumes that the input is a string and does not contain any error checking or handling for non-string inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
