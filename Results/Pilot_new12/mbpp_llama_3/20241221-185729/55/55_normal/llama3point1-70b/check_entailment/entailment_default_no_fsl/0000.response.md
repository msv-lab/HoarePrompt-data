Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the code capitalizes the first letter of the first word, which is not the standard convention for camel case. In camel case, the first word should be in lowercase, and only the first letter of each subsequent word should be capitalized.

For example, if the input string is "hello_world", the function should return "helloWorld", but the given code will return "HelloWorld". This is a clear deviation from the expected output, and therefore, the program is not correct.

Additionally, the code does not handle edge cases such as empty strings, strings with only underscores, or strings with consecutive underscores, as mentioned in the output hints. While the code may not crash or produce an error for these cases, it does not produce the expected output, which further supports the conclusion that the program is incorrect. 

To fix this, the code should be modified to handle the first word separately, keeping it in lowercase, and then capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent word. This can be achieved with a simple modification to the code. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code might look:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
