The code splits the string `snake_case_str` into a list of words using the underscore `_` as a delimiter. 

`words` is assigned the value of `snake_case_str` split by `_`. 

The state of the other variable `snake_case_str` is not affected.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by '_'**
