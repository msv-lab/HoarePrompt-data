To determine the output state, let's break down the given code. The initial state provides that `snake_case_str` is a string and `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by '_'. The code then creates `camel_case_str` by capitalizing each word in `words` and joining them together.

Given that `words` is created by splitting `snake_case_str` by '_', each word in `words` is a substring of `snake_case_str` separated by underscores. The `capitalize()` method capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes all other characters in the word lowercase. The `''.join(...)` then concatenates these capitalized words into a single string without any separators, effectively converting the original snake_case string into camelCase.

The impact on the program is the creation of a new variable, `camel_case_str`, which holds the camelCase equivalent of `snake_case_str`. The states of `snake_case_str` and `words` are not changed by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `snake_case_str` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by '_', and `camel_case_str` is the camelCase version of `snake_case_str`, which is `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)`.
Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings from `snake_case_str` split by '_', `camel_case_str` is `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)**
