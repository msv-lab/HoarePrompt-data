#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. If the tuples are of unequal lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring the remaining elements of the longer tuple. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for cases where the input tuples contain non-integer values or are not tuples at all. The state of the program after the function concludes will be that the original tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, remain unchanged, and a new tuple containing the bitwise AND results is returned, potentially truncated to the length of the shorter input tuple. The function's output will only contain integers, as a result of the bitwise AND operation, and will be `()` if both input tuples are empty.
