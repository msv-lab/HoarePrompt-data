Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided program only performs a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two tuples. This is not the expected behavior based on the problem description.

A correct implementation would involve comparing each pair of elements from the two tuples and returning a tuple where each element is either the difference or ratio (depending on the interpretation of "elementwise") between the corresponding elements, or an indication of which element is larger.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

If the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), and we expect the function to return a tuple indicating which elements are larger in the first tuple and which are larger in the second tuple (for example, (1, 1, 1, 1) if the first tuple's elements are all larger), the provided program would return (0, 0, 2, 1) which does not match the expected output. 

It seems the provided unit tests are also incorrect or incomplete as they do not cover enough edge cases. 

However, another possible interpretation of the problem is that it is asking for a comparison between the two tuples, element-wise, and the program is performing a bitwise AND operation which is not equivalent to comparison. 

In any case, there is not enough information in the problem description to uniquely determine the expected behavior of the function. But based on the most likely interpretation, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

To fix the code and make it work as expected, we would need a clear definition of what "elementwise and tuples" means in this context. If it means to return a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding element in the first tuple is larger, and 0 otherwise, we could implement it as follows:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(int(a > b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
