You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. If the tuples are of unequal lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring the remaining elements of the longer tuple. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for cases where the input tuples contain non-integer values or are not tuples at all. The state of the program after the function concludes will be that the original tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, remain unchanged, and a new tuple containing the bitwise AND results is returned, potentially truncated to the length of the shorter input tuple. The function's output will only contain integers, as a result of the bitwise AND operation, and will be `()` if both input tuples are empty.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
