Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have analyzed the program's behavior. 

The problem description asks to extract the elementwise difference between two tuples. However, the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples, as stated in the original assessment. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that the function returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Therefore, I agree with the original assessment that the program does not meet the problem description. The program performs a bitwise AND operation instead of calculating the elementwise difference between the two tuples.

The correct implementation to extract the elementwise difference between two tuples should use subtraction instead of bitwise AND. For example:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

This implementation would return the correct elementwise difference between the two tuples, as required by the problem description.

Since the provided code does not meet the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
