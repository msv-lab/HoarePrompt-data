Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`, whereas the problem description asks for extracting the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. 

There is no clear definition of what "extracting the elementwise and tuples" means, but based on common interpretations, it could mean comparing the corresponding elements of the two tuples and returning a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements are equal, 0 if the corresponding elements are not equal, or perhaps returning a tuple where each element is the comparison result (e.g., greater, less, equal).

However, the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation, which is not the same as comparing or extracting elements. For example, given the input `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the program returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the result of the bitwise AND operation, not the extraction or comparison of the elements.

To fulfill the problem description, a correct program would need to be provided with a clear definition of what "extracting the elementwise and tuples" means. For instance, if it means returning a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements are equal and 0 otherwise, the correct program would be:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(1 if a == b else 0 for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

Or if it means returning a tuple where each element is the comparison result (e.g., greater, less, equal), the correct program would be:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple('greater' if a > b else 'less' if a < b else 'equal' for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
