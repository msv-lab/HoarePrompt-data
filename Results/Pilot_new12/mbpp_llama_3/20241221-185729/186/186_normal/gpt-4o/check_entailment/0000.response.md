Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` does not extract the elementwise difference between two tuples as described in the problem. Instead, it performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples.

For example, if we call `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the function returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the result of the bitwise AND operation on each pair of elements. However, the elementwise difference between the two tuples should be `(10-5, 4-2, 6-3, 9-3) = (5, 2, 3, 6)`. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
