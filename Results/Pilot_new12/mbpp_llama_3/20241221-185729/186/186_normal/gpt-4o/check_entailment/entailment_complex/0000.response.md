Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. The problem description asks for a function that extracts the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

The problem description and the code do not match because "extracting element-wise and tuples" is not clearly defined. However, based on typical operations used on tuples, the problem description likely asks for a function that performs an element-wise logical AND operation, not a bitwise AND operation.

The code provided does not handle this case, instead performing a bitwise AND operation between the integers, which is not what the problem description asks for. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

If the problem description meant to ask for a bitwise AND operation, then it should have been specified as such. However, given the typical use of "and" in the context of tuples, it is more likely that a logical AND operation is intended. 

To fix this, the code should be modified to perform an element-wise logical AND operation. For example, it should return a tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

Here's an example of what the corrected code could look like:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a and b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

This corrected code performs an element-wise logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. However, this is still an assumption, and the problem description should be clarified to ensure the correct operation is being performed.
