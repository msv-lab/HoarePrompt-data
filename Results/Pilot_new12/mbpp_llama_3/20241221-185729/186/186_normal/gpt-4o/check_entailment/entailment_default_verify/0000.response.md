Based on the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment makes sense. The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise difference between two tuples, but the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation instead.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts two tuples and returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements. This further supports the original assessment that the program does not meet the problem description.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function should return the elementwise difference between the two tuples, but instead, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation. For example, the function call `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should return `(5, 2, 3, 6)`, which is the elementwise difference between the two tuples, but instead, it returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the result of the bitwise AND operation.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program's correctness is **False**.

Reasoning: The program does not meet the problem description, and the output hints confirm this. The program performs a bitwise AND operation instead of extracting the elementwise difference between the two tuples.

Final: **False**
