Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided code only performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. 

The function `func_1` does not "extract" tuples as the problem description suggests. Instead, it performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples and returns a new tuple with the results. If the goal is to extract elementwise and tuples, the code does not meet this requirement.

For example, if the input tuples are `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, the function will return `(0, 0, 2)` which is the result of the bitwise AND operation, not the extracted tuples. 

To meet the problem description, the code should be modified to extract the tuples elementwise, but the exact implementation would depend on the specific requirements of what "extracting tuples" entails, which is not clearly defined in the problem description. 

However, if we consider the problem description as asking for a function to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two tuples, the code would be correct, but since the problem description specifically mentions "extract the elementwise and tuples" which does not match the provided code's functionality, the correctness is **False**.
