Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have analyzed the program's behavior and reasoning.

The original assessment correctly points out that the given function `func_1` does not extract the elementwise difference between two tuples as described in the problem. Instead, it performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples. This is evident from the line `return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))`, which uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to combine the elements of the two tuples.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that "The program returns a tuple containing the results of bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`." This annotation supports the original assessment, as it clearly indicates that the program is performing a bitwise AND operation rather than calculating the elementwise difference.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the problem description.

Final: **False**.
