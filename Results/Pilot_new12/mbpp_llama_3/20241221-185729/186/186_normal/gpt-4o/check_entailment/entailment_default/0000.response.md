Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples, which does not match the problem description.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. This is confirmed by the unit tests provided, which show the expected results of the bitwise AND operation.

However, the problem description does not mention anything about performing a bitwise AND operation. Instead, it asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, which is a different operation.

For example, if the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the function should return a tuple containing the corresponding elements of the two tuples, not the result of a bitwise AND operation. The expected output should be ((10, 5), (4, 2), (6, 3), (9, 3)), not (0, 0, 2, 1).

Therefore, the code does not match the problem description, and the Correctness is **False**.
