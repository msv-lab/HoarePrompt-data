#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. It assumes that both tuples are of the same length and that their elements support bitwise AND operation. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. The original tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, remain unchanged. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the bitwise AND operation between elements of the tuples.
