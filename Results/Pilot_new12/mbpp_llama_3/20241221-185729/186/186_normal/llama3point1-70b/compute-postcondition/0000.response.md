To calculate the output state, let's consider what the given Python code snippet does. The code uses a generator expression within the built-in `tuple()` function to create a new tuple. This new tuple is formed by performing a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The `zip(tup1, tup2)` function is used to iterate over `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel.

Given that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples, the code will return a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2**
