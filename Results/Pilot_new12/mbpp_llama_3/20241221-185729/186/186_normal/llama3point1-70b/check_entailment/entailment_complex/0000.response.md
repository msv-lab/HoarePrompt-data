Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided program only performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the two tuples. 

There is no indication in the problem description that the operation to be performed on the tuples is a bitwise AND, nor does the term "elementwise" specifically imply this operation. Elementwise operations can refer to any operation performed on corresponding elements of two or more data structures, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. 

The program only performs the bitwise AND operation, which does not cover all possible elementwise operations, and thus does not fully meet the problem description. 

To meet the problem description, the program should be able to handle various elementwise operations, not just bitwise AND. For example, the program could be modified to accept an additional parameter specifying the operation to perform on the tuples. 

Here's a simple example of how the function could be modified to support different elementwise operations:

```python
import operator

def func_1(tup1, tup2, op=operator.and_):
    operations = {
        'and': operator.and_,
        'or': operator.or_,
        'xor': operator.xor,
        'add': operator.add,
        'sub': operator.sub,
        'mul': operator.mul,
        # Add more operations as needed
    }
    
    if op not in operations:
        raise ValueError("Invalid operation")
    
    return tuple(operations[op](x, y) for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This modified function can handle different elementwise operations by specifying the operation as a parameter. However, the original program does not provide this flexibility and only performs a bitwise AND operation, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
