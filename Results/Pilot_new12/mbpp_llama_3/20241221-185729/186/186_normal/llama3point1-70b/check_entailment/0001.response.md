Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to extract the element-wise AND operation between two tuples, but it does not handle tuples of different lengths correctly. If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, potentially ignoring some elements from the longer tuple. 

Additionally, the program uses the bitwise AND operator `&`, which may not be the correct operation for all data types. If the tuples contain non-integer values (e.g., strings or floats), this operation may not produce the expected results.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the tuples are of different lengths. For example:

```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5)

result = func_1(tup1, tup2)
print(result)  # Output: (0, 0)
```

In this case, the `zip` function ignores the third element of `tup1`, which is `3`. The correct result should be either an error message or a result that takes into account all elements from both tuples.

To fix this issue, the function should add error checking to ensure both tuples are of the same length and handle cases where the lengths differ. It should also consider the data types of the elements in the tuples and perform the correct operation accordingly. 

For example, the function could be modified to raise an error if the tuples are of different lengths:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("Tuples must be of the same length")
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
