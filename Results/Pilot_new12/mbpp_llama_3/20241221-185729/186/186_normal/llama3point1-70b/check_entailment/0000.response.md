Correctness: **False**.

The given program attempts to extract the element-wise minimum using the bitwise AND operator (&). However, the bitwise AND operator is not the correct operator to use for this task. The correct operator would be a comparison operator or a function like `min()`.

For example, if `tup1 = (5, 10, 15)` and `tup2 = (3, 12, 14)`, the program would return `(1, 10, 14)` which is not the expected result. The expected result should be `(3, 10, 14)`.

A correct version of the program would be:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(min(x, y) for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2))
```
This corrected program uses the `min()` function to find the minimum value between corresponding elements in the two tuples.
