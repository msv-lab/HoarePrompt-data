Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input and returns a new tuple containing the element-wise bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression is used to compute the bitwise AND of corresponding elements.

The output hints describe the behavior of the function in detail, including the assumptions about the input tuples and the potential issues that may arise if the tuples are of different lengths or if the elements do not support the bitwise AND operation.

After reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function correctly computes the element-wise bitwise AND of corresponding elements from the two input tuples and returns the result as a new tuple.

The code assumes that both tuples are of the same length, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, which is also consistent with the behavior described in the output hints.

Overall, based on the code and the output hints, it appears that the function is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
