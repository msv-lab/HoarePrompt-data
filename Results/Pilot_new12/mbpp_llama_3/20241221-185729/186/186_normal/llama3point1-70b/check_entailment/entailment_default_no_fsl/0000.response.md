Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to extract the element-wise bitwise AND operation from two tuples. The function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` takes two tuples as input, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

The code correctly implements this functionality by using the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel, performing the bitwise AND operation on each pair of elements. The result is then returned as a new tuple.

The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, handling cases where the tuples are of the same length and where they are of different lengths. The function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

In all potential cases, the code operates under the assumption that the input tuples contain elements that support the bitwise AND operation, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. 

Since the program description does not explicitly mention handling potential exceptions, it's also valid to assume that the input will be such that no exceptions occur during execution. Therefore, the code correctly implements the desired functionality as described in the problem statement for all potential valid inputs.
