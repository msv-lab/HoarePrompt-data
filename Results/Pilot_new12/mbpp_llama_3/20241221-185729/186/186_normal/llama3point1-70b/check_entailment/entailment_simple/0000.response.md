Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The problem description asks to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. In the context of tuples and bitwise operations, "and" typically refers to the bitwise AND operation.

2. The provided program performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the two input tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, using the `zip` function to pair these elements together.

3. The result of this operation is returned as a tuple, which aligns with the expectation of extracting element-wise and (bitwise AND) results from the input tuples.

4. Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., both inputs are tuples of the same length, and their elements are integers or other types supporting the bitwise AND operation), the program will correctly compute the bitwise AND of corresponding elements.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and under the assumption of valid input, the program behaves as expected and is considered correct.
