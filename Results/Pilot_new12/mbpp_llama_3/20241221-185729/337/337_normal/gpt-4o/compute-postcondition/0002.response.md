Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the sum of unique integers in the list. It removes duplicate integers and calculates the sum of the remaining unique integers. The function handles lists of varying lengths and contents, including empty lists and lists with all duplicate elements. In the case of an empty list, the function will return 0, as the sum of an empty set is 0. The input list itself is not modified by the function, and the original list remains unchanged after the function call. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will always be a list of integers. If the input list contains non-integer elements, the function may raise a TypeError.**
