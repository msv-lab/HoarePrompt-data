Correctness: **False**

The given Python function `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem description, which asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function uses `set(lst)` to remove duplicates and then sums up the unique elements. However, this approach does not distinguish between elements that appear only once in the list and those that appear multiple times.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should count the occurrences of each element and only include elements that appear exactly once in the sum. The current implementation sums up all unique elements, regardless of their original frequency.

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, the function should return `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`, because only these elements appear once in the list. However, the current implementation would return `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`, which is incorrect.

Here is a correct implementation of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```

This function creates a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element, and then sums up only the elements that appear exactly once.
