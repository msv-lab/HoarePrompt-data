To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The original assessment claims that the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement this, as it simply returns the sum of unique elements in the list, not the sum of non-repeated elements.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it's clear that the function `func_1` indeed calculates the sum of unique elements in the list, not the sum of elements that appear exactly once (non-repeated elements). This understanding aligns with the original assessment.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the function `func_1` will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is the sum of unique elements, not `2`, which would be the sum of non-repeated elements.

Given this analysis, the original assessment's conclusion that the program does not meet the problem description's requirements seems accurate. The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion by detailing the function's behavior, which matches the original assessment's critique.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Final: **False**
