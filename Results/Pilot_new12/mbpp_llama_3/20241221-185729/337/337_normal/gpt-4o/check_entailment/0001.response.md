Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function does not meet the problem description's requirements. The function is supposed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the current implementation simply returns the sum of the unique elements in the list, which is not the same as the sum of non-repeated elements.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, but the correct result should be `1 + 3 = 4`, because `2` is repeated in the list.

The issue with the current implementation is that it does not distinguish between elements that appear only once in the list and elements that appear multiple times. To fix this, the function should count the occurrences of each element and only include elements that appear exactly once in the sum.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in counts.items() if count == 1)
```
