You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is supposed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the current implementation simply returns the sum of the unique elements in the list, which is not necessarily the same thing.

A case where this function does not work correctly is when the list contains multiple occurrences of the same element that needs to be excluded from the sum because it's repeated, but it should only be counted once if it was unique. For example, if the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the function will return the sum of unique elements, which is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. However, according to the problem description, the correct output should be the sum of non-repeated elements, which in this case would be `2`, because only `2` appears once in the list.

To correctly implement the function, it should count the occurrences of each element, and then sum up only those elements that appear exactly once. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```

This version of the function first counts the occurrences of each element using a dictionary, and then sums up only the elements that appear exactly once.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the sum of unique integers in the list. It removes duplicate integers and calculates the sum of the remaining unique integers. The function handles lists of varying lengths and contents, including empty lists and lists with all duplicate elements. In the case of an empty list, the function will return 0, as the sum of an empty set is 0. The input list itself is not modified by the function, and the original list remains unchanged after the function call. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will always be a list of integers. If the input list contains non-integer elements, the function may raise a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
