The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1` does not meet the problem description because it returns the sum of unique elements in the list, not the sum of non-repeated elements. This assessment is accurate.

The problem description specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Non-repeated elements are those that appear exactly once in the list. However, the provided function `func_1` uses `set(lst)` to remove duplicates and then sums up the remaining elements. This approach sums all unique elements, not just those that appear once in the original list.

For example, given the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the function `func_1` will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `2`, because `2` is the only element that appears exactly once in the list.

The output hints provided also support the original assessment. They state that the function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicate integers, and calculates the sum of the remaining unique integers. While this describes what the function does, it does not align with the problem description's requirement to sum only non-repeated elements.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program does not meet the specified requirements.

Final: **False**
