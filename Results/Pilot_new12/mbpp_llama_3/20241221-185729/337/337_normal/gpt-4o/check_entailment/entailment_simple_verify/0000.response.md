The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1` does not correctly find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Instead, it returns the sum of the unique elements in the list. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description.

The problem description requires the sum of elements that appear only once in the list, which means if an element appears more than once, it should not be included in the sum, regardless of whether it's a unique element or not. However, the current implementation of `func_1` uses the `set` function to get unique elements, which does not distinguish between elements that appear once and those that appear multiple times but are still unique.

The annotated version of the code confirms this interpretation. It states that the program returns the sum of unique integers in the list, which aligns with the reasoning behind the original assessment. There is no indication in the annotated version that the function checks for the count of each element to determine if it's repeated or not; it simply considers uniqueness.

Given this, the original assessment correctly identifies that the function does not meet the problem's requirements. It provides a correct explanation for why the function is flawed and even offers a corrected version that accurately sums the non-repeated elements by first counting their occurrences.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Final: **False**.
