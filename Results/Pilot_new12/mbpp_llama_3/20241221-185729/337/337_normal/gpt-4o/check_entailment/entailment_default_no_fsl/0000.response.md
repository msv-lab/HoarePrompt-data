Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it calculates the sum of unique elements in the list, not the sum of non-repeated elements. A non-repeated element is an element that appears only once in the list, whereas a unique element is an element that appears at least once in the list. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], the sum of non-repeated elements should be 1, but the code will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 because it calculates the sum of unique elements. 

A correct implementation would be to count the occurrences of each element in the list and only include elements with a count of 1 in the sum. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in counts.items() if count == 1)
```
