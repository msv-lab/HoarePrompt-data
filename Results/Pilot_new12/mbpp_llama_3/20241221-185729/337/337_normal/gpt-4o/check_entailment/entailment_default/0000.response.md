Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not correctly implement the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, but the code calculates the sum of unique elements. 

A non-repeated element is an element that appears only once in the list. The code, on the other hand, uses a set to remove duplicates and then sums up the remaining unique elements. This means that if an element appears multiple times in the list, it will still be included in the sum, which is not in line with the problem description.

Here's an example to illustrate this: consider the list [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]. The sum of non-repeated elements should be 2, because 2 is the only element that appears only once in the list. However, the code will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, because it sums up the unique elements.

To correctly implement the function, we would need to identify the elements that appear only once in the list and sum them up. Here's an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in counts.items() if count == 1)
```

This function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list, and then sums up the numbers that appear only once.
