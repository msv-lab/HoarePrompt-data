Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it returns the sum of all unique elements in the list, not the sum of non-repeated elements. The problem description specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, which means that elements that appear more than once in the list should not be included in the sum, even if they are unique. 

In the provided program, the function uses a set to remove duplicates and then sums up all the unique elements. This approach does not distinguish between elements that appear once and elements that appear multiple times in the original list. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], the function will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the correct sum of non-repeated elements should be 1, because 1 is the only element that appears only once in the list. 

To correctly solve the problem, the function should count the occurrences of each element and only include elements that appear exactly once in the sum. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in count_dict.items() if value == 1)
```
