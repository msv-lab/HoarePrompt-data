Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is supposed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the current implementation simply returns the sum of the unique elements in the list, which is not necessarily the same thing.

A case where this function does not work correctly is when the list contains multiple occurrences of the same element that needs to be excluded from the sum because it's repeated, but it should only be counted once if it was unique. For example, if the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the function will return the sum of unique elements, which is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. However, according to the problem description, the correct output should be the sum of non-repeated elements, which in this case would be `2`, because only `2` appears once in the list.

To correctly implement the function, it should count the occurrences of each element, and then sum up only those elements that appear exactly once. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```

This version of the function first counts the occurrences of each element using a dictionary, and then sums up only the elements that appear exactly once.
