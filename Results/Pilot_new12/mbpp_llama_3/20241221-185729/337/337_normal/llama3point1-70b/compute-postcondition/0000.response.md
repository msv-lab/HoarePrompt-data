To solve this task, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state. The initial state is that `lst` is a list of integers. The code snippet is designed to return the sum of all integers in `lst` that appear only once.

Here's how it works:
- The expression `lst.count(i)` counts the number of occurrences of each integer `i` in `lst`.
- The condition `if lst.count(i) == 1` filters the integers to only include those that appear once in `lst`.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these unique integers.

Therefore, the impact of the code on the program is to calculate and return the sum of all integers that are unique in the list `lst`.

Given that `lst` is a list of integers, the return value will be the sum of all unique integers in this list. This sum can be any integer value depending on the contents of `lst`, but it specifically represents the total of all integers that appear only once in `lst`.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`.**
