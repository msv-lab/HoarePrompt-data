The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It handles edge cases where the list may be empty, contain duplicate integers, or contain only unique integers. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the original list and only considers the unique integers for the sum, ignoring any duplicates. The final state of the program after execution is that the original list remains unchanged, and the sum of unique integers is returned as the result.
