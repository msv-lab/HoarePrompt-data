To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided information, let's analyze the problem description, the program itself, and the annotated version of the program.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of elements that appear only once in the list. This is achieved using a generator expression within the `sum` function, which iterates over each element `i` in `lst` and includes it in the sum only if `lst.count(i)` equals 1, indicating that `i` appears exactly once in the list.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on several reasons:
- It correctly identifies and sums non-repeated elements.
- It ignores repeated elements.
- It handles various cases, including lists with mixed repeated and non-repeated elements, lists where all elements are unique, and empty lists.

The annotated version of the code is consulted to provide further insight into the program's behavior. The annotation before the function call indicates that `lst` is a list of integers, which aligns with the problem's expectations. The annotation after the `return` statement confirms that the program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`, which directly corresponds to the problem description's requirement.

Based on this analysis, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, and the annotations support this conclusion by clarifying the state of the program and its expected output.

Therefore, considering the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, it seems that the program correctly meets the problem description's requirements.

Final: **True**
