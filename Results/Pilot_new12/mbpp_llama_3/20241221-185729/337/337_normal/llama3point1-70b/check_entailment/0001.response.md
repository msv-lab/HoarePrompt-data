Correctness: **True**

The given Python function correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. Here's why it works:

- The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
- For each element, it checks if the count of that element in the list is 1 using `lst.count(i) == 1`. If this condition is true, it means the element is non-repeated.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these non-repeated elements.

This approach handles every potential case:
- It correctly identifies and sums non-repeated elements.
- It ignores repeated elements, as they do not meet the `lst.count(i) == 1` condition.
- It works for lists containing a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements.
- It works for lists where all elements are unique (i.e., every element is non-repeated).
- It works for empty lists, returning 0 as expected since there are no elements to sum.

Given that this function works as expected for all conceivable inputs and cases, it is considered correct according to the problem description.
