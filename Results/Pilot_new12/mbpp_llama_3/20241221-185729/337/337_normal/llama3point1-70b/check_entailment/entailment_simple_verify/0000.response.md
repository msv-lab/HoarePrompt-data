The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list and considers the function to be correct. This assessment is based on the function's ability to handle different scenarios such as empty lists, lists with all unique elements, lists with repeated elements, and lists with duplicate elements and a single unique element.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by indicating that the function returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`. This aligns with the problem description of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

Upon reviewing the code and the annotations, it is clear that the function is designed to iterate over the list and include an element in the sum only if its count in the list is 1. This logic correctly identifies non-repeated elements and sums them up.

The original assessment is accurate because it thoroughly evaluates the function's behavior in various cases and concludes that the function meets the problem description. The annotated version of the code reinforces this conclusion by providing a clear description of the function's return value.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
