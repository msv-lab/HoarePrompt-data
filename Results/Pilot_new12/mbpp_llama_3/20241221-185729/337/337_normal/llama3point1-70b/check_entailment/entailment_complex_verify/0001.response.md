To evaluate the correctness of the program, we need to carefully consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the provided annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a Python function that calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The original assessment concludes that the provided function is correct. This assessment is based on a logical breakdown of the function's operation, which correctly identifies and sums non-repeated elements in a list.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It describes the state of the program before the function call, where `lst` is a list of integers, and explains that the function returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. The annotations also mention that the function handles edge cases where the list may be empty, contain duplicate integers, or contain only unique integers, and that it does not modify the original list.

Given this information, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect. The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, indicating that the function operates as intended.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the annotations, the program correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct is supported by the annotations and the logical analysis of the function's behavior.

Final: **True**
