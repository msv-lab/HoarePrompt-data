Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and includes an element in the sum only if its count in the list is 1, which effectively sums up all unique elements (those that appear only once). The function handles various edge cases as mentioned in the output hints: 

- If the list is empty, `sum` of an empty iterable, which is what the generator expression returns in such a case, is 0, aligning with the expected behavior.
- It correctly sums unique integers in lists containing duplicate integers or only unique integers.
- Since it's a pure function (it does not modify the input list), the original list remains unchanged after execution.

The function is designed under the assumption of valid input, which aligns with the problem's premise. Therefore, without considering edge cases such as non-list inputs or invalid data types within the list (since these scenarios are not defined within the problem description), the function behaves as specified for all valid inputs. 

The code's logic is straightforward and correctly implements the required functionality based on the description provided, making it correct for the intended use case.
