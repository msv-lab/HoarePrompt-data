Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code is a Python function named `func_1` that calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list and add up only those numbers that appear once in the list, as determined by `lst.count(i) == 1`. 

The output hints describe the function's behavior accurately and cover several edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with duplicate integers, and a list with only unique integers. 

For every potential case, including the edge cases mentioned, the code will work as expected:
- If the list is empty, `sum` will return 0, which is correct for the sum of non-repeated elements in an empty list.
- If the list contains duplicates, `lst.count(i) == 1` will filter out those duplicates, ensuring only the first occurrence of each number (the ones that are essentially "unique" to the list in the context of repetition) is considered for the sum. However, it's crucial to note that `lst.count(i)` might not be the most efficient way to check for uniqueness, especially for large lists, due to its linear time complexity. Yet, from a correctness perspective regarding the problem description, it does the job.
- If the list contains only unique integers, `lst.count(i) == 1` will evaluate to True for every integer, and thus all integers will be summed up, which is the correct behavior.

The function does not modify the original list, adhering to the description that it "does not modify the original list." It treats the list as an input to calculate the sum of unique elements and returns this sum without altering the list.

Given these observations, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description for every potential case mentioned, including edge cases, assuming valid input as per the guidelines provided.
