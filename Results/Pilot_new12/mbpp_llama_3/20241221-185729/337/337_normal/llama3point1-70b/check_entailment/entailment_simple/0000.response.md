Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of all non-repeated elements in the given list `lst`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

* The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
* For each element `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in the list `lst` is equal to 1 using the `count` method. This condition ensures that only non-repeated elements are considered.
* If an element `i` is non-repeated (i.e., its count is 1), it is included in the sum calculated by the `sum` function.
* The function returns the sum of all non-repeated elements in the list.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
