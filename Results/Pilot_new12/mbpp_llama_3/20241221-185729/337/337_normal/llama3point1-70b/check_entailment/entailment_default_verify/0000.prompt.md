You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and includes an element in the sum only if its count in the list is 1.

This function works correctly for all potential cases. For instance, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the function will return `3` because only `3` appears once in the list.

Here's a breakdown of how the function handles different scenarios:

- **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, the function will return `0` (the sum of an empty generator expression), which is the expected result because there are no elements to sum.
- **List with all unique elements**: If all elements in the list are unique, the function will return the sum of all elements in the list, which is the expected result.
- **List with repeated elements**: If there are repeated elements in the list, the function will only include each element in the sum if it appears once. This correctly handles cases where some elements are repeated and others are not.
- **List with duplicate elements and a single unique element**: The function correctly identifies and sums the unique element(s) while ignoring the repeated elements.

Since the function handles all these cases as expected and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It handles edge cases where the list may be empty, contain duplicate integers, or contain only unique integers. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the original list and only considers the unique integers for the sum, ignoring any duplicates. The final state of the program after execution is that the original list remains unchanged, and the sum of unique integers is returned as the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
