Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and includes an element in the sum only if its count in the list is 1.

This function works correctly for all potential cases. For instance, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the function will return `3` because only `3` appears once in the list.

Here's a breakdown of how the function handles different scenarios:

- **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, the function will return `0` (the sum of an empty generator expression), which is the expected result because there are no elements to sum.
- **List with all unique elements**: If all elements in the list are unique, the function will return the sum of all elements in the list, which is the expected result.
- **List with repeated elements**: If there are repeated elements in the list, the function will only include each element in the sum if it appears once. This correctly handles cases where some elements are repeated and others are not.
- **List with duplicate elements and a single unique element**: The function correctly identifies and sums the unique element(s) while ignoring the repeated elements.

Since the function handles all these cases as expected and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct.
