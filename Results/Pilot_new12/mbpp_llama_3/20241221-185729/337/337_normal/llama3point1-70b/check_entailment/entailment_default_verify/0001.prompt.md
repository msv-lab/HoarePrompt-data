You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. Here's why it works:

- The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
- For each element, it checks if the count of that element in the list is 1 using `lst.count(i) == 1`. If this condition is true, it means the element is non-repeated.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these non-repeated elements.

This approach handles every potential case:
- It correctly identifies and sums non-repeated elements.
- It ignores repeated elements, as they do not meet the `lst.count(i) == 1` condition.
- It works for lists containing a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements.
- It works for lists where all elements are unique (i.e., every element is non-repeated).
- It works for empty lists, returning 0 as expected since there are no elements to sum.

Given that this function works as expected for all conceivable inputs and cases, it is considered correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It handles edge cases where the list may be empty, contain duplicate integers, or contain only unique integers. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the original list and only considers the unique integers for the sum, ignoring any duplicates. The final state of the program after execution is that the original list remains unchanged, and the sum of unique integers is returned as the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
