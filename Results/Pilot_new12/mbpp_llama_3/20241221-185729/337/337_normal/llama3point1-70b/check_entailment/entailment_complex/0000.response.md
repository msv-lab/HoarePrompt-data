Correctness: **True**

The program provided meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of all non-repeated elements in the given list `lst`. 

Here is why the program is correct:

- It iterates over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
- For each element, it checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1 using the `count()` method. This effectively identifies unique (non-repeated) elements.
- It sums up all such unique elements using a generator expression within the built-in `sum()` function.
- The function handles edge cases implicitly because the `sum()` function returns 0 if the list is empty (since there are no elements to sum), and it ignores duplicates by design since only elements with a count of 1 are included in the sum.
- The function does not modify the original list, as it does not include any operations that would change the list (such as append, insert, remove, etc.), and it only reads from the list using the `count()` method and iteration.
- Finally, it returns the sum of unique integers as the result, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Therefore, for every potential case, the program will behave as expected according to the problem description, making it correct.
