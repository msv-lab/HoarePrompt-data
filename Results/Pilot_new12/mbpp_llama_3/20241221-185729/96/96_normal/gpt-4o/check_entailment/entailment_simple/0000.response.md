Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Handling Empty Tuple**: The function first checks if the tuple is empty using the condition `if (not tup)`. If the tuple is empty, it immediately returns `True`, which aligns with the problem description since there are no elements with different types in an empty tuple.

2. **Determining the Type of the First Element**: It then determines the type of the first element in the tuple using `first_type = type(tup[0])`. This serves as a reference type to compare with the types of the remaining elements in the tuple.

3. **Iterating Through the Tuple and Comparing Types**: The function iterates through each element in the tuple. For each element, it checks if the type of the current element is different from `first_type` using `if type(element)!= first_type`. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all elements have the same type.

4. **Returning True for Tuples with the Same Type Elements**: If the loop completes without finding any elements with a different type, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple are of the same type.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the provided function correctly implements the logic to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, as described in the problem description. It handles the edge case of an empty tuple and correctly identifies tuples with uniform types and those with mixed types.
