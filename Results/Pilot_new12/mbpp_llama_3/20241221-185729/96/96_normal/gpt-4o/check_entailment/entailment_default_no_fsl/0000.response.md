Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements a function to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not. The function, `func_1`, takes a tuple `tup` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements are of the same type.

Here is a breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Handling Empty Tuple**: The function correctly returns `True` when the tuple is empty, as there are no elements to compare. This is in line with the problem description and makes logical sense since there are no elements of different types in an empty tuple.

2. **Same Type Elements**: When all elements in the tuple are of the same type, the function correctly identifies this and returns `True`.

3. **Different Type Elements**: If the tuple contains elements of different types, the function correctly returns `False` as soon as it encounters an element of a different type. This is efficient because it stops checking as soon as it finds a mismatch, rather than checking all elements.

4. **Type Comparison**: The function uses the `type()` function to compare the types of elements, which is the standard way in Python to determine the type of a variable. This ensures that the comparison is accurate.

5. **Edge Cases and General Cases**: The provided unit tests and output hints cover various scenarios, including tuples with the same type of elements, tuples with different types of elements, and an empty tuple. The function behaves as expected in all these cases.

Since the code correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem and demonstrated by the provided unit tests and output hints, and given the assumption that the input will always be a valid tuple (never causing errors such as a non-tuple input), the code's correctness is confirmed.
