Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns True. Then it stores the type of the first element in the tuple and iterates over the rest of the elements. If it encounters an element of a different type, it immediately returns False. If it iterates over all elements without finding any of a different type, it returns True.

The code handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple and tuples with elements of different types. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about its functionality.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the code. For example, `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns True because all elements are integers, `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns False because the tuple contains both integers and a string, and `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns True because all elements are integers.

Given the provided code, output hints, and unit tests, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
