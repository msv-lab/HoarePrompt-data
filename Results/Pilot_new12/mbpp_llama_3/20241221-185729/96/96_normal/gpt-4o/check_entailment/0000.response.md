Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a function named `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, and `False` otherwise. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function first checks if the input tuple is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to compare, and the condition of having the same data type is trivially satisfied for an empty tuple.

2. If the tuple is not empty, the function determines the data type of the first element and assigns it to the variable `first_type`.

3. The function then iterates over the rest of the elements in the tuple. For each element, it checks if the data type of the element is the same as `first_type`. If it encounters an element with a different data type, it immediately returns `False`.

4. If the function iterates over the entire tuple without finding any elements with a different data type, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers, and `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the tuple contains both integers and a string.

Overall, the function correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, and it handles edge cases such as an empty tuple. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `True`.
