You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the tuple and compares its type with the type of the first element. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements without finding any with a different type, it returns `True`.

This program works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Empty tuple**: The program correctly handles the case where the tuple is empty, returning `True` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Tuple with elements of the same type**: The program correctly returns `True` for tuples where all elements have the same data type.

3. **Tuple with elements of different types**: The program correctly returns `False` for tuples where elements have different data types.

4. **Tuples with different lengths and combinations of data types**: The program's solution does not depend on the length of the tuple or the specific data types, so it works for all possible combinations.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including empty tuples, tuples with mixed data types, and tuples with the same data type.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, handling all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple parameter `tup` and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `tup` are of the same type. If `tup` is empty, it returns `True`. If all elements in `tup` are of the same type, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` as soon as it encounters an element of a different type. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple and tuples with elements of different types. The final state of the program after execution will be one of two possible return values: `True` if the tuple is empty or all elements are of the same type, and `False` if the tuple is non-empty and contains elements of different types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
