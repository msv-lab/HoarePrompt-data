You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a function named `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, and `False` otherwise. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function first checks if the input tuple is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because there are no elements to compare, and the condition of having the same data type is trivially satisfied for an empty tuple.

2. If the tuple is not empty, the function determines the data type of the first element and assigns it to the variable `first_type`.

3. The function then iterates over the rest of the elements in the tuple. For each element, it checks if the data type of the element is the same as `first_type`. If it encounters an element with a different data type, it immediately returns `False`.

4. If the function iterates over the entire tuple without finding any elements with a different data type, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the tuple have the same data type.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers, and `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the tuple contains both integers and a string.

Overall, the function correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, and it handles edge cases such as an empty tuple. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `True`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple parameter `tup` and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `tup` are of the same type. If `tup` is empty, it returns `True`. If all elements in `tup` are of the same type, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` as soon as it encounters an element of a different type. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple and tuples with elements of different types. The final state of the program after execution will be one of two possible return values: `True` if the tuple is empty or all elements are of the same type, and `False` if the tuple is non-empty and contains elements of different types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
