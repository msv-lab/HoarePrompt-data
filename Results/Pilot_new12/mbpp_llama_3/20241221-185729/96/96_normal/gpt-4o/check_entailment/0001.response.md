Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the tuple and compares its type with the type of the first element. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements without finding any with a different type, it returns `True`.

This program works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Empty tuple**: The program correctly handles the case where the tuple is empty, returning `True` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Tuple with elements of the same type**: The program correctly returns `True` for tuples where all elements have the same data type.

3. **Tuple with elements of different types**: The program correctly returns `False` for tuples where elements have different data types.

4. **Tuples with different lengths and combinations of data types**: The program's solution does not depend on the length of the tuple or the specific data types, so it works for all possible combinations.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including empty tuples, tuples with mixed data types, and tuples with the same data type.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, handling all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
