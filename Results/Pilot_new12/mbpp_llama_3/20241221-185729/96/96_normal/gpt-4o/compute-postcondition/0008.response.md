According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is the first element in `tup`, and the type of `element` is equal to `first_type`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `tup` must have at least 2 elements and the `element` is the second element in the `tup`. 
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least 2 elements, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is the second element in `tup`**
