According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If `tup` has at least 2 elements and the loop has executed once, it means the first element has been processed. For the loop to execute again, `tup` must have at least 3 elements. The `element` variable currently holds the second element of `tup`, so for the next iteration, it should hold the third element. The type check condition remains the same, comparing the type of the current `element` (which will be the third element in the next iteration) with the type of the first element `first_type`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the tuple, if the type of the third element `element` is not the same as the type of the first element `first_type`, the function returns False; otherwise, no changes are made**
