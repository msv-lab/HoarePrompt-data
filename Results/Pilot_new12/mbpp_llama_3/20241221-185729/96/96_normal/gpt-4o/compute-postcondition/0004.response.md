According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tup` is a tuple and `tup` is not empty, and `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, for the loop to be executed, `tup` must have at least 1 element, and `element` is now the first element in `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of `tup[0]`, `element` is the first element in `tup`**
