Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple parameter `tup` and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `tup` are of the same type. If `tup` is empty, it returns `True`. If all elements in `tup` are of the same type, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` as soon as it encounters an element of a different type. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple and tuples with elements of different types. The final state of the program after execution will be one of two possible return values: `True` if the tuple is empty or all elements are of the same type, and `False` if the tuple is non-empty and contains elements of different types.**
