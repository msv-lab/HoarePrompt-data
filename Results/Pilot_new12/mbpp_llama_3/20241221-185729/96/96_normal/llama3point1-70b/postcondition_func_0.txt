The function accepts a tuple as input, checks if all elements within the tuple are of the same data type, and returns a boolean value. If all elements in the tuple are of the same type, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function handles tuples of any size and containing any types of elements, including empty tuples, for which it will return True since there are no elements of different types. The function does not modify the input tuple and does not perform any actions other than the type comparison and the return of the result. It covers all potential cases, including when the tuple contains elements of built-in types (like integers, floats, strings) and user-defined types, treating each type distinctly.
