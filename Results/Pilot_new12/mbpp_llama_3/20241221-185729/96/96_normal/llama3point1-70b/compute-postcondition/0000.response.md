To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

The initial state is that `tup` is a tuple. 

The code `return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1` checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same type.

Here's how it works:
- `type(x) for x in tup` generates the types of all elements in `tup`.
- `set(...)` removes duplicates from these types, leaving only unique types.
- `len(...)` counts the number of unique types.
- `== 1` checks if this count is equal to 1, meaning all elements are of the same type.

Given that `tup` is a tuple, the program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether all elements in `tup` are of the same type.

Output State: **The program returns True if all elements in tuple 'tup' are of the same type, otherwise it returns False**
