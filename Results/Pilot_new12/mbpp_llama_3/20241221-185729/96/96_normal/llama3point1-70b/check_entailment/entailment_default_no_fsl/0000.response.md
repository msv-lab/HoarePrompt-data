Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type and returns a boolean value indicating whether they do or not. 

The function `func_1(tup)` uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple, converts this into a set (which automatically removes any duplicates), and then checks if the length of this set is equal to 1. If it is, that means all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and it works with elements of built-in types as well as user-defined types, treating each type distinctly. Since the program description specifies that the input will always be valid (i.e., a tuple), the function is correctly designed to handle all potential valid inputs without error. 

The output hints agree with this analysis, confirming that the function behaves as expected for various cases, including empty tuples, tuples with homogeneous elements, and tuples with heterogeneous elements. Therefore, based on the given problem description and output hints, the program is correct for every potential case.
