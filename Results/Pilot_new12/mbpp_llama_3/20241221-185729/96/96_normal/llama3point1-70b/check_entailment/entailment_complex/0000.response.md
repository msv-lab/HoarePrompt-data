Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the tuple are of the same type.
2. **Type Comparison**: The function uses a set comprehension `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the types of all elements in the tuple. It then checks if the length of this set is equal to 1, which means all elements have the same type.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases, such as:
	* Empty tuples: Since there are no elements, the set comprehension will return an empty set, and the function will return `True`.
	* Tuples with single element: The set comprehension will return a set with a single element, and the function will return `True`.
	* Tuples with multiple elements of the same type: The set comprehension will return a set with a single element, and the function will return `True`.
	* Tuples with multiple elements of different types: The set comprehension will return a set with multiple elements, and the function will return `False`.
4. **Type Distinction**: The function treats each type distinctly, including built-in types (like integers, floats, strings) and user-defined types.
5. **Input Assumption**: Since we assume the input will be a valid tuple, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a tuple or an empty tuple.

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it correct.
