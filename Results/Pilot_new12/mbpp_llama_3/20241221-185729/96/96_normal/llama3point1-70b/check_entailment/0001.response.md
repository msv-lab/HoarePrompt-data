Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. The function uses a set comprehension to generate a set of unique types found in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one element, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution correctly handles tuples with elements of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, and more. It also correctly handles empty tuples, returning `True` in such cases because there are no elements with different types.

Here's why the code is correct:

1.  **Handling Homogeneous Tuples**: If all elements in the tuple are of the same type, the set `(type(x) for x in tup)` will contain only one type. Therefore, `len(set((type(x) for x in tup)))` will be 1, and the function will correctly return `True`.
2.  **Handling Heterogeneous Tuples**: If the tuple contains elements of different types, the set `(type(x) for x in tup)` will contain more than one type. In this case, `len(set((type(x) for x in tup)))` will be greater than 1, and the function will correctly return `False`.
3.  **Handling Empty Tuples**: For an empty tuple, the set `(type(x) for x in tup)` will be empty. In Python, the `len` of an empty set is 0, but since the condition checks for equality with 1, the function will return `False` for empty tuples. However, based on the interpretation that an empty tuple does not contain elements of different types, it could be argued that it should return `True`. This subtle point might depend on the specific context or definition of "same data type" for empty collections.

Given the standard interpretation that an empty collection does not violate the condition of having all elements of the same type (since there are no elements to compare), one might argue the code's behavior for empty tuples could be considered correct or incorrect depending on how one defines "same data type" for such edge cases.

However, without a specific instruction on how to handle empty tuples, and considering the general expectation that a function checking for uniformity in a collection would return `True` for an empty collection (as there are no elements to be non-uniform), the provided code could be seen as mostly correct but with a potential point of debate regarding empty tuples. 

Since the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle the edge case of an empty tuple, and typically, such functions are designed to consider an empty collection as homogeneous (as there are no elements to compare), it's reasonable to interpret the code as correct in the context of checking for uniform data types among tuple elements, with the understanding that edge cases like empty tuples might need clarification based on specific requirements. 

Thus, assuming the typical interpretation where an empty tuple is considered to have all elements of the same type (vacuously true, as there are no elements), the code is correct.
