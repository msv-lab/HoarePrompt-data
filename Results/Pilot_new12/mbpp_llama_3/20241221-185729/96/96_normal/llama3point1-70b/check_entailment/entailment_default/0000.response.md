Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks if all elements within the tuple are of the same data type. The function uses a set comprehension to create a set of unique types of elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one element, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The code correctly handles tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and containing any types of elements, including built-in types and user-defined types. The function treats each type distinctly and does not modify the input tuple.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior, including the handling of empty tuples, tuples with elements of the same type, and tuples with elements of different types.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and covers all potential cases, the correctness of the code is **True**.
