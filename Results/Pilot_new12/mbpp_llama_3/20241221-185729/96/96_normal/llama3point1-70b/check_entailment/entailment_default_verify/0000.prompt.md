You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by creating a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. In Python, a set only stores unique elements, so if all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one element. The program then checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that all elements have the same type. Otherwise, it returns False.

This program works correctly for all potential cases. For example:

- If the tuple contains only one element, the set will contain only one element, regardless of the type of that element.
- If the tuple contains multiple elements of the same type, the set will contain only one element, which is the type of those elements.
- If the tuple contains elements of different types, the set will contain more than one element, and the function will correctly return False.

Some examples to demonstrate this:

```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3)))  # Returns: True
print(func_1(('a', 'b', 'c')))  # Returns: True
print(func_1((1, 'a', 3)))  # Returns: False
print(func_1((True, False, True)))  # Returns: True
print(func_1((1.0, 2.0, 3.0)))  # Returns: True
print(func_1((1, 2.0, 3)))  # Returns: False
```

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected, correctly identifying whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple as input, checks if all elements within the tuple are of the same data type, and returns a boolean value. If all elements in the tuple are of the same type, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function handles tuples of any size and containing any types of elements, including empty tuples, for which it will return True since there are no elements of different types. The function does not modify the input tuple and does not perform any actions other than the type comparison and the return of the result. It covers all potential cases, including when the tuple contains elements of built-in types (like integers, floats, strings) and user-defined types, treating each type distinctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
