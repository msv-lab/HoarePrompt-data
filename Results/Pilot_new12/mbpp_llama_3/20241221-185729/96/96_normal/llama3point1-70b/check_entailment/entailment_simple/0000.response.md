Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(tup)` checks if all the elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type or not.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple.
2. The `set` function is used to store the unique types found in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one element.
3. The `len` function is used to check the length of the set. If the length is 1, it means all elements have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Tuples with all elements of the same type (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)` or `("a", "b", "c")`).
* Tuples with elements of different types (e.g., `(1, "a", 3.5)`).
* Empty tuples (in which case the function will return `True`, since there are no elements to check).

Overall, the program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not, and it does so in a concise and efficient manner.
