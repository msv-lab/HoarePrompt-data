Correctness: **True**.

The given program checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by creating a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. In Python, a set only stores unique elements, so if all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one element. The program then checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that all elements have the same type. Otherwise, it returns False.

This program works correctly for all potential cases. For example:

- If the tuple contains only one element, the set will contain only one element, regardless of the type of that element.
- If the tuple contains multiple elements of the same type, the set will contain only one element, which is the type of those elements.
- If the tuple contains elements of different types, the set will contain more than one element, and the function will correctly return False.

Some examples to demonstrate this:

```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3)))  # Returns: True
print(func_1(('a', 'b', 'c')))  # Returns: True
print(func_1((1, 'a', 3)))  # Returns: False
print(func_1((True, False, True)))  # Returns: True
print(func_1((1.0, 2.0, 3.0)))  # Returns: True
print(func_1((1, 2.0, 3)))  # Returns: False
```

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected, correctly identifying whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Therefore, the program is correct.
