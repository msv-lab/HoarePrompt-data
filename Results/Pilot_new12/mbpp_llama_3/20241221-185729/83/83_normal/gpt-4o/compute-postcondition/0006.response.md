The value of `max_index` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `max_index` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `max_index` is 2**
