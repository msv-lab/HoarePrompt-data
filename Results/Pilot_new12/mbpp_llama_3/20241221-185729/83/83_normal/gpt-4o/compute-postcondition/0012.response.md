To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides that `n` is the length of `arr`, a list of elements, `i` is `n-1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`. The code simply returns `max_index`.

Given this, we understand that `max_index` holds the position in the list `arr` where the maximum value among all elements in `arr` is found. Since `n` is the length of `arr` and `i` is `n-1`, it implies that the list `arr` has at least one element because `i` (which is `n-1`) is a valid index for `arr`. The value of `max_index` will be an integer ranging from 0 to `n-1` because these are the possible indices for any list of length `n`.

The program returns `max_index`, which is the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`, which is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.**
