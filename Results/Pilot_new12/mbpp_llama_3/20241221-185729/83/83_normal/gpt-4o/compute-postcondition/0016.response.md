Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged as its original content and order are preserved except possibly at indices `max_index` and `curr_size - 1` where `max_index` equals `find_max_index(n - 2)`, `n` remains the same, `curr_size` remains `n - 2`, and if `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, then `arr` is modified at indices `max_index` and `curr_size - 1`; otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged with `max_index` being `curr_size - 1`.**
