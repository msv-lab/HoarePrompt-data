The code initializes a variable `max_index` to 0. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, and `arr` is a list of elements. 

The value of `n` and the elements of `arr` remain unchanged, as the code only introduces a new variable `max_index`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, `arr` is a list of elements, and the function has access to this list for indexing purposes where the index range of `arr` is 0 <= i < n, `max_index` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, `arr` is a list of elements, and the function has access to this list for indexing purposes where the index range of `arr` is 0 <= i < n, `max_index` is 0**
