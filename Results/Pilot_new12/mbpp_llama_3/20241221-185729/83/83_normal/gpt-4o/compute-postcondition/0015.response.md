Functionality: **The function reverses the elements of a list `arr` between indices 0 and `end` (inclusive) by swapping elements from the start and end indices, incrementing the start index, and decrementing the end index until `start` equals or exceeds `end`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the list `arr` is modified in-place, resulting in a list with the elements up to the index `end` reversed. The function assumes `arr` is a list and `end` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `end` < len(`arr`). If the input list is empty or `end` is 0, the function does not modify the list. If `end` equals or exceeds the length of the list, the function still reverses the elements up to the last valid index of the list.**
