The value of `max_index` is updated to `i`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, and `max_index` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, and `max_index` is 3**
