To determine the adjusted state for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of elements.
- The index range of `arr` is `0 <= i < n`.
- `max_index` is 0.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will start from `i = 1` and go up to `i = n-1`.

For the loop to execute:
- Since `i` starts from 1, `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once. This is because if `n` were 1, the range would be `range(1, 1)`, which is empty.
- `i` is the loop variable and will take values from 1 to `n-1`.
- `arr` must have at least two elements for the loop to access `arr[1]` without an `IndexError`.
- `max_index` being 0 does not directly impact the execution of the loop but is part of the state.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 (at the start of the loop), `max_index` is 0**
