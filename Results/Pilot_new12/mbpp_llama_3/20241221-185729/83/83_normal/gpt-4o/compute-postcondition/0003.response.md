The code updates the value of `max_index` to be equal to `i`. Given the initial state, `n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `max_index` is 0. Since `arr` has an element at index `i` that is greater than the element at index `max_index`, this condition implies that the element at index 1 is greater than the element at index 0.

After executing the code, `max_index` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `max_index` is 1**
