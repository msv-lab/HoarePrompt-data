Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should sort a list of elements, but the provided code and annotations indicate that the function `func_1` actually sorts the list in descending order, not in ascending order as expected. 

Although the problem description does not explicitly state whether the sort should be in ascending or descending order, the examples provided in the problem description, such as `func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]`, suggest that the sort should be in ascending order. However, the code and annotations clearly show that the list is sorted in descending order.

Additionally, there are potential issues with edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element, but the problem description and annotations assume that the input list will have at least two elements, and the correctness of the program is evaluated under this assumption.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically for the case where the input list should be sorted in ascending order, and hence the correctness of the code is **False**.
