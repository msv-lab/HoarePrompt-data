Correctness: **False**.

The program provided is attempting to sort a list in descending order using a pancake sort algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation.

1. The function `func_1(arr)` is missing the definition of `arr`. The array to be sorted is not being passed to the function. 

2. The function `find_max_index(n)` uses a globally defined `arr`, which is not defined in the provided code.

3. The function `flip(end)` also uses a globally defined `arr`, which is not defined in the provided code.

4. The `flip` function only flips the array up to the `end` index, but it does not ensure that the `end` index is within the bounds of the array.

5. The algorithm used to sort the array is a pancake sort algorithm, which is not a standard sorting algorithm and may not be efficient for large lists.

A case where the program does not work as expected is when the input array is not defined. For example, calling `func_1([3,1,2])` would result in a NameError because `arr` is not defined.

To fix the code, the `arr` variable should be passed to the `func_1`, `find_max_index`, and `flip` functions, and the `flip` function should be modified to ensure that the `end` index is within the bounds of the array. 

Here is an example of a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index)
            flip(arr, curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(arr, end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```
This corrected version of the code should work as expected, but it is still not a standard or efficient sorting algorithm. A more efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, would be recommended for large lists.
