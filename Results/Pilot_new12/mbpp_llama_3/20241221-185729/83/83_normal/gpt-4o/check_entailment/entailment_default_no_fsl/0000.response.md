Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to sort a list of elements. However, based on the provided code and output hints, it appears that the function `func_1` is designed to sort the list in descending order using a pancake sorting algorithm, which relies on the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions.

After analyzing the code, I found that the `func_1` function does not handle the case when the input list has less than two elements. The annotations indicate that the length `n` is at least 2 after the function execution, but there is no explicit check for this condition. 

Furthermore, the `find_max_index` function does not handle the edge case where the list `arr` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), which could raise an exception or produce incorrect results.

Another issue is that the `func_1` function modifies the original list `arr` but does not explicitly handle the case when the input list is empty or has only one element. In such cases, the function may not behave as expected or may not return the correct result.

The output hints also mention that the function assumes the list has at least two elements and that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and functioning correctly. However, this assumption does not guarantee that the function will work correctly for all potential cases, especially when the input list has less than two elements or when the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are not correctly implemented.

Therefore, I conclude that the code does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
