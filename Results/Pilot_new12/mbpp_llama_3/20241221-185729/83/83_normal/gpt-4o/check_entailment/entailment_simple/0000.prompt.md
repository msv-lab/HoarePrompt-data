You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and the functions find_max_index and flip are defined elsewhere in the program, where find_max_index takes an integer as input and returns an index, and flip takes an index as input and flips the elements in the list up to that index.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list sorted in descending order, `n` is the length of `arr` and is at least 2, `curr_size` equals 2.
    return arr
    #The program returns a list 'arr' that is sorted in descending order and has a length 'n' that is at least 2

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and end is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` equals the original value of `end`, `end` equals or is less than `start`, and the elements of `arr` between the original indices 0 and `end` are reversed.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of a list arr, arr is a list of elements, and the function find_max_index has access to this list for indexing purposes, where the index range of arr is 0 <= i < n.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is `n-1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`, which is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
