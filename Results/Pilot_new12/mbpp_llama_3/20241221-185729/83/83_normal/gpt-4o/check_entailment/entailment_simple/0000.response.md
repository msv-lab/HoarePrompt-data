Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to sort a list of elements in descending order. However, the problem description asks for a function that sorts a list of elements, which typically implies an ascending order sort. 

In the provided code, the `func_1` function uses the `find_max_index` function to find the index of the maximum element in the list and then flips this element to the end of the list. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted in descending order. 

However, the problem description does not specify the order of sorting. If we assume the typical case of ascending order, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Another issue with the code is that it modifies the global `arr` variable in the `flip` function, which is not a good practice. The function should take the list as an argument and return the modified list.

To fix the program and make it follow the problem description, we need to modify it to sort the list in ascending order. This can be done by changing the `find_max_index` function to find the minimum index and flipping the elements accordingly.

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def find_min_index(n):
    min_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:
            min_index = i
    return min_index

def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        min_index = find_min_index(curr_size)
        if min_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(min_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
```

However, it's worth noting that this implementation is not the most efficient way to sort a list. Python has built-in sorting functions like `sorted()` or `list.sort()` that can be used to sort a list in ascending order. 

For example:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```
