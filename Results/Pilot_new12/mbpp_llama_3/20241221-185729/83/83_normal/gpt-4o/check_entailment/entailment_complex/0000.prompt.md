You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and the functions find_max_index and flip are defined elsewhere in the program, where find_max_index takes an integer as input and returns an index, and flip takes an index as input and flips the elements in the list up to that index.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list sorted in descending order, `n` is the length of `arr` and is at least 2, `curr_size` equals 2.
    return arr
    #The program returns a list 'arr' that is sorted in descending order and has a length 'n' that is at least 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The function assumes that the list has at least two elements and the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and functioning correctly. The returned list will have the same length as the input list, and all elements will be in descending order. If the input list has less than two elements, the function may not behave as expected since the annotations indicate that the length `n` is at least 2 after the function execution. Additionally, the functionality of the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions is crucial to the correct operation of `func_1`, but their implementation details are not provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and end is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` equals the original value of `end`, `end` equals or is less than `start`, and the elements of `arr` between the original indices 0 and `end` are reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reverses the elements of a list `arr` between indices 0 and `end` (inclusive) by swapping elements from the start and end indices, incrementing the start index, and decrementing the end index until `start` equals or exceeds `end`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the list `arr` is modified in-place, resulting in a list with the elements up to the index `end` reversed. The function assumes `arr` is a list and `end` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `end` < len(`arr`). If the input list is empty or `end` is 0, the function does not modify the list. If `end` equals or exceeds the length of the list, the function still reverses the elements up to the last valid index of the list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of a list arr, arr is a list of elements, and the function find_max_index has access to this list for indexing purposes, where the index range of arr is 0 <= i < n.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is `n-1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`, which is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max_index` accepts a parameter `n`, which represents the length of a list `arr`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. The returned index is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. If there are multiple maximum elements, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. The function does not handle edge cases where the list `arr` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), in which case it may not work as expected or may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the list `arr` is accessible and correctly indexed, and that `n` accurately represents the length of `arr`. The function performs a single pass through the list to find the maximum element, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n).




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
