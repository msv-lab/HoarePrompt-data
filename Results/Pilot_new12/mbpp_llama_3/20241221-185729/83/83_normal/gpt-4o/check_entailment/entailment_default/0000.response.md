Correctness: **False**

The code is attempting to sort a list of elements in descending order, but it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The main issue with the code is that it does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm.

The `func_1` function tries to sort the list by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list and placing it at the end of the unsorted portion. However, this approach is not correct.

The `find_max_index` function finds the index of the maximum element in the list up to the given index `n`, but it does not guarantee that the maximum element is placed at the end of the unsorted portion.

Additionally, the `flip` function reverses the elements of the list up to the given index `end`, but it does not correctly implement the swapping of elements.

The output hints for the `func_1` function suggest that it returns the list sorted in descending order, but the code does not actually implement this. 

One example where the program does not work as expected is when the input list is [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]. The program will not correctly sort this list in descending order.

The `func_1` function is also missing the definition of `arr`. The `find_max_index` and `flip` functions operate on `arr`, but `arr` is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter to these functions. 

Overall, the code does not meet the problem description and does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
