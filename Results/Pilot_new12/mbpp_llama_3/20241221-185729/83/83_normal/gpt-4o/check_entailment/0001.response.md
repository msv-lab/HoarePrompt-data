Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it has several issues. 

1. The variable `arr` is used in the functions `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index`, but it is not defined as a global variable or passed as an argument to these functions. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to access `arr`.

2. The function `func_1` calls `find_max_index(curr_size)` but `find_max_index` function should take the array as an argument, not the size of the array. Also, it's trying to find the maximum index in the array, but the index passed to `flip` function should be within the range of the array.

3. The function `func_1` is trying to sort the array in descending order by finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the array and flipping it to the end of the unsorted part. However, this approach is incorrect because it's trying to sort the array from right to left, but the functions `flip` and `find_max_index` are not correctly implemented for this purpose.

4. The function `flip` is trying to flip the elements in the array, but it's not correctly implemented. It should flip the elements from the start to the end, but the end index is not correctly calculated.

5. The functions `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index` are not correctly implemented to sort the array. The correct approach to sort the array is to use a sorting algorithm like bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: if we call `func_1([5, 2, 8, 1, 9])`, it will throw a `NameError` because `arr` is not defined. 

To fix these issues, we need to redefine the functions `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index` to correctly sort the array. Here's an example of a correct implementation using selection sort:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        max_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = j
        arr[i], arr[max_index] = arr[max_index], arr[i]
    return arr

arr = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
print(func_1(arr))  # Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]
```
