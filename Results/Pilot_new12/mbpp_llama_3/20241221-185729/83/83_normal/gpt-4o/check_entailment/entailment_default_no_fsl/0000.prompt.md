You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The function assumes that the list has at least two elements and the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and functioning correctly. The returned list will have the same length as the input list, and all elements will be in descending order. If the input list has less than two elements, the function may not behave as expected since the annotations indicate that the length `n` is at least 2 after the function execution. Additionally, the functionality of the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions is crucial to the correct operation of `func_1`, but their implementation details are not provided.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reverses the elements of a list `arr` between indices 0 and `end` (inclusive) by swapping elements from the start and end indices, incrementing the start index, and decrementing the end index until `start` equals or exceeds `end`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the list `arr` is modified in-place, resulting in a list with the elements up to the index `end` reversed. The function assumes `arr` is a list and `end` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `end` < len(`arr`). If the input list is empty or `end` is 0, the function does not modify the list. If `end` equals or exceeds the length of the list, the function still reverses the elements up to the last valid index of the list.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `find_max_index` accepts a parameter `n`, which represents the length of a list `arr`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. The returned index is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. If there are multiple maximum elements, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. The function does not handle edge cases where the list `arr` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), in which case it may not work as expected or may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the list `arr` is accessible and correctly indexed, and that `n` accurately represents the length of `arr`. The function performs a single pass through the list to find the maximum element, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n).



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
