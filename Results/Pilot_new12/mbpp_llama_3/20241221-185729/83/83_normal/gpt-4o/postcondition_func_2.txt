The function `find_max_index` accepts a parameter `n`, which represents the length of a list `arr`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. The returned index is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. If there are multiple maximum elements, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. The function does not handle edge cases where the list `arr` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), in which case it may not work as expected or may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the list `arr` is accessible and correctly indexed, and that `n` accurately represents the length of `arr`. The function performs a single pass through the list to find the maximum element, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n).
