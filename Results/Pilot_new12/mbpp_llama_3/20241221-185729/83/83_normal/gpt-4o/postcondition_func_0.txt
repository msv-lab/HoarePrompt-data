The function `func_1` accepts a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The function assumes that the list has at least two elements and the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and functioning correctly. The returned list will have the same length as the input list, and all elements will be in descending order. If the input list has less than two elements, the function may not behave as expected since the annotations indicate that the length `n` is at least 2 after the function execution. Additionally, the functionality of the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions is crucial to the correct operation of `func_1`, but their implementation details are not provided.
