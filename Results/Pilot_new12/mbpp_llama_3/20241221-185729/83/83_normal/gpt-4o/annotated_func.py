#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and the functions find_max_index and flip are defined elsewhere in the program, where find_max_index takes an integer as input and returns an index, and flip takes an index as input and flips the elements in the list up to that index.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list sorted in descending order, `n` is the length of `arr` and is at least 2, `curr_size` equals 2.
    return arr
    #The program returns a list 'arr' that is sorted in descending order and has a length 'n' that is at least 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of elements `arr` as input and returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The function assumes that the list has at least two elements and the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and functioning correctly. The returned list will have the same length as the input list, and all elements will be in descending order. If the input list has less than two elements, the function may not behave as expected since the annotations indicate that the length `n` is at least 2 after the function execution. Additionally, the functionality of the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions is crucial to the correct operation of `func_1`, but their implementation details are not provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and end is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` equals the original value of `end`, `end` equals or is less than `start`, and the elements of `arr` between the original indices 0 and `end` are reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reverses the elements of a list `arr` between indices 0 and `end` (inclusive) by swapping elements from the start and end indices, incrementing the start index, and decrementing the end index until `start` equals or exceeds `end`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but the list `arr` is modified in-place, resulting in a list with the elements up to the index `end` reversed. The function assumes `arr` is a list and `end` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `end` < len(`arr`). If the input list is empty or `end` is 0, the function does not modify the list. If `end` equals or exceeds the length of the list, the function still reverses the elements up to the last valid index of the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of a list arr, arr is a list of elements, and the function find_max_index has access to this list for indexing purposes, where the index range of arr is 0 <= i < n.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is `n-1`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`, which is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max_index` accepts a parameter `n`, which represents the length of a list `arr`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. The returned index is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. If there are multiple maximum elements, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. The function does not handle edge cases where the list `arr` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), in which case it may not work as expected or may raise an exception. Additionally, the function assumes that the list `arr` is accessible and correctly indexed, and that `n` accurately represents the length of `arr`. The function performs a single pass through the list to find the maximum element, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n).
