According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size` and `n`. If `size` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is equal to 1 (since it started from `n` and decremented by 1 in each iteration), `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `size` must be decremented by 1, so `size` becomes 0, but since the loop condition is `size` greater than 0, the loop will not execute again if `size` is 0. However, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the state before the condition is checked. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time the `size` must be greater than 0 which means `size` is decremented by 1 so `size` becomes `n - 1` (considering the state before the last iteration), and `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n - 1`**
