Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n - 1`. If the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` is not at the last position of `arr[:size]`, then the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` are in reverse order and the last element of `arr` remains unchanged. If the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` is at the last position of `arr[:size]`, then no changes are made to `arr`.***
