The code reverses the elements of the list `arr` up to the index `size - 1`. Since `size` is equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in `arr`, the entire list `arr` is reversed. 

The state of `n` and `size` remains unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The state of `max_index` is also updated because the maximum value in `arr` is now at a different position after reversal. 

If `max_index` was not equal to 0, then it was the original index of the maximum value in `arr` before reversal. After the reversal, the maximum value is now at the index `size - max_index - 1` (which is `n - max_index - 1` since `size` equals `n`), assuming that `max_index` is the index of the maximum value from the beginning of the list. 

If `max_index` was 0, then it remains the index of the maximum value in `arr` because the first element was the maximum value and it becomes the last element after reversal, but `max_index` itself does not change since it is defined as the index of the maximum value before the reversal.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is the reversed list of the original elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, and `max_index` is either updated to `n - max_index - 1` if `max_index` is not 0 or remains 0 if `max_index` was originally 0.

Output State: **`arr` is the reversed list of the original elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, if `max_index` was not 0 then `max_index` becomes `n - max_index - 1`, if `max_index` was 0 then `max_index` is 0.**
