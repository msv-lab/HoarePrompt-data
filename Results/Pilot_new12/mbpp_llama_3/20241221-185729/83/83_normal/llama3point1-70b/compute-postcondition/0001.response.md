According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The loop iterates from `n` down to 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of elements and `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, this does ensure that the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. 
State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, size is `n`**
