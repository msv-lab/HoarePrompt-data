The code `n = len(arr)` assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. The length of a list in Python is the number of elements it contains. 

The initial state mentions that `arr` is a list of elements, which implies it can have any number of elements (including zero). After executing the code, the value of `n` will be equal to the number of elements in `arr`.

The state of `arr` does not change; it remains a list of elements. However, we now have additional information about `arr` through the variable `n`, which represents the count of elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr`**
