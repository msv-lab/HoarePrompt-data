To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables in the initial state. The initial state includes: 
- `arr` is a list of elements.
- `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0.
- `size` is `n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
```
This line of code does the following:
1. `arr[:size]` creates a slice of the list `arr` from the start up to, but not including, the index `size`. Since `size` is equal to `n`, this slice includes all elements of `arr`.
2. `max(arr[:size])` finds the maximum value in this slice of `arr`.
3. `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value in the entire list `arr`.

Given that `size` equals `n`, and `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, `arr[:size]` effectively includes all elements of `arr`. Thus, `max(arr[:size])` finds the maximum value in `arr`, and `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value.

The output state, therefore, includes the initial state variables with the addition of `max_index`, which is set to the index of the maximum value in `arr`. The states of `arr`, `n`, and `size` are not changed by this operation, as it only reads from these variables and does not modify them.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr`.**
