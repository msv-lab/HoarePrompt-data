Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 0, and `max_index` remains undefined due to the initial error condition, and no reversal of elements in `arr` occurs because `max_index` is 0 or the error condition prevents its valid assignment.**
