Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`. If `max_index` was not equal to `size - 1`, then `arr` is the reversed list of the original elements. If `max_index` was not 0, then `max_index` becomes `n - max_index - 1` after the reversal, otherwise `max_index` remains 0. If `max_index` was equal to `size - 1`, then `arr` and `max_index` remain unchanged.***
