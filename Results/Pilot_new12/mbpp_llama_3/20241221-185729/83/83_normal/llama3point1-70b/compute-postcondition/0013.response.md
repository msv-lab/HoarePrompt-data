The given code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the order of the first `size` elements of the list `arr`. 

Given that `size` is equal to `n - 1`, the code reverses the order of the first `n - 1` elements of the list `arr`. 

If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are initially in reverse order. However, after the code is executed, the first `n - 1` elements are reversed. This means that if `max_index + 1` is less than `n - 1`, the first `max_index + 1` elements will be reversed again, making them in the original order. If `max_index + 1` is equal to `n - 1`, the first `n - 1` elements will be reversed, making them in the original order. If `max_index` is 0, the list `arr` remains unchanged initially, but after the code is executed, the first `n - 1` elements are reversed.

So, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n - 1`, the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` are in reverse order, and the last element of `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n - 1`, the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` are in reverse order, and the last element of `arr` remains unchanged.**
