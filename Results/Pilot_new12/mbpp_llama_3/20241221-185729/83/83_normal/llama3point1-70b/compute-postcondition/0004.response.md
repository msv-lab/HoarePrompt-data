Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr`. The current value of `max_index` is not equal to the last index of `arr`, which is `size - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `max_index` is not equal to 0.**
