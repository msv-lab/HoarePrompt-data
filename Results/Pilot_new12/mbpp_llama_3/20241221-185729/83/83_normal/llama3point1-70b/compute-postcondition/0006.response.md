Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, then the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed, and `max_index` is the original index of the maximum value in `arr` before reversal, which is not equal to the last index of `arr` (`size - 1`) and not equal to 0. If `max_index` is 0, then the state of `arr`, `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remains unchanged, with `max_index` being the index of the maximum value in `arr` and also being the first element.**
