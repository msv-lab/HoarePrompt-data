The given code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the order of the elements in the slice `arr[:max_index + 1]`. 

Since `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]` and `size` is equal to `n - 1`, the reversal affects the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr`. 

After the reversal, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are in reverse order, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged. 

The value of `n` remains the same because the number of elements in `arr` has not changed. 

The value of `size` also remains the same, `n - 1`, as it is not affected by the reversal operation.

However, `max_index` might change because the maximum element in `arr[:size]` could be in a different position after the reversal.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with the first `max_index + 1` elements in reverse order, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n - 1`**
