Since `size` is 0, `arr[:size]` will be an empty list. The `max` function will throw an error when trying to find the maximum value of an empty list. However, in this case, we're looking at the code's intent and the state of variables after execution.

In Python, attempting to find the maximum value of an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`. But to calculate the outcome, let's assume we're looking at what happens before the error is raised. 

Given that `arr[:size]` is empty because `size` is 0, and knowing that `max` on an empty list would cause an issue, the line tries to find the index of the maximum value in an empty list. However, this operation will fail and doesn't change the fact that `max_index` is being assigned based on an operation that doesn't make sense with the given initial state.

Since `arr` is a list of elements and `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, and `size` is 0, attempting to execute this line of code will result in an error because it tries to find the index of the maximum value in an empty list slice. The state of `arr`, `n`, and `size` remains unchanged because the error occurs before any assignment can happen.

However, to follow your instructions precisely without accounting for the error:

- `arr` remains a list of elements.
- `n` remains the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0.
- `size` remains 0.
- The operation to assign `max_index` would fail because `arr[:size]` is empty.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 0, and an error occurs when trying to assign `max_index` due to attempting to find the maximum of an empty sequence.**
