You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr`. If the original list `arr` was empty (i.e., `n` was 0), then `arr` remains an empty list.
    return arr
    #The program returns a sorted list 'arr' in ascending order, which contains 'n' number of elements, if 'n' is 0 then 'arr' remains an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of elements as input and returns the same list sorted in ascending order. It handles the edge case where the input list is empty, in which case it returns the empty list as is. The function modifies the original list in place through its sorting operations. It does not add or remove any elements from the list, thus preserving the original number of elements. If the input list contains duplicate elements, they will be ordered accordingly in the sorted output. The function does not validate the type of elements in the list, implying it relies on the elements being comparable for sorting purposes.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
