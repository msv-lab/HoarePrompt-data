Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly sort a list of elements in every potential case. It appears to be implementing a modified version of the pancake sort algorithm. However, this algorithm is not suitable for sorting lists of elements in ascending order. 

One of the main issues with the code is that it does not compare and swap elements correctly to achieve a sorted list. The pancake sort algorithm is typically used for sorting a stack of pancakes by size, and it works by repeatedly flipping the top pile of pancakes to move the largest pancake to the bottom. 

The code provided attempts to apply this concept to sorting a list, but it does not ensure that the list is sorted in ascending order after the sorting operations. 

For example, if we take the list [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4], the code will not correctly sort this list in ascending order. The output will not be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] as expected.

Another issue is that the code does not handle the case where the input list contains non-comparable elements, such as strings and integers. The code relies on the elements being comparable for sorting purposes, but it does not validate the type of elements in the list.

Overall, the code does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm for lists of elements and does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**. 

A correct implementation of a sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, would be needed to correctly sort a list of elements in every potential case. 

Here is an example of how a correct implementation of a sorting algorithm could be written:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return func_1(left) + middle + func_1(right)
```
