Correctness: **False**

The given program is attempting to sort a list of elements in ascending order. However, it does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm for all potential cases. 

One potential case where the program fails is when the list contains duplicate elements. The line `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` will return the index of the first occurrence of the maximum element, which may not be the last occurrence. 

For example, if the input list is `[4, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the program will not correctly sort the list because it will only consider the first occurrence of the maximum element `4`.

Another issue with the program is its inefficiency. The use of `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` has a time complexity of O(n) within a loop that runs n times, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n^2). This can be improved by using a more efficient sorting algorithm.

A correct implementation of a sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, would ensure that the list is sorted correctly in all cases, including when there are duplicate elements. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation using Python's built-in `sorted` function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr)
```

This function will correctly sort the list in ascending order, regardless of whether there are duplicate elements or not. 

However, the original program does not work correctly for all potential cases, therefore its correctness is **False**.
