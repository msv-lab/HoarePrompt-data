The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. After executing the function body, if `tuples` is not empty, the function returns a list of averages where each element is the average of the elements at the corresponding position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. If `tuples` is empty, it returns an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numbers and return a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples, handling the case where the input tuple is empty.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numbers and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples, or an empty list if the input tuple is empty.**
