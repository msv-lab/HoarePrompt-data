The given Python code snippet is executed as follows:

`averages` is assigned a new element, which is `avg`, the average of the first elements of the inner tuples in `tuples`. The states of the other variables, `tuples`, `num_elements`, `i`, `elements_at_position`, and `avg`, are not affected. 

`avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now contains this value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is a list with the average of the first elements of each inner tuple, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is a list containing `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
