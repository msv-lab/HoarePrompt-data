The code `averages = []` declares an empty list called `averages`. This does not affect the values of `tuples` and `num_elements`. 

The length of the inner tuples in `tuples` is still equal to `num_elements`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is an empty list**
