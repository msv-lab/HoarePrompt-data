The code `num_elements = len(tuples[0])` assigns the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples` to the variable `num_elements`. Since all inner tuples have the same length, `num_elements` will be equal to the length of any inner tuple. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of the inner tuples.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of the inner tuples**
