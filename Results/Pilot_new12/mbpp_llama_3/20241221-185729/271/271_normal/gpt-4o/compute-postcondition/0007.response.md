To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length.
- `num_elements` is greater than 1 and equal to the length of the inner tuples.
- `averages` is a list containing at least one average.
- `i` is 1.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.
- `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

The given code is:
```python
elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
```

This code updates the `elements_at_position` list by taking the `i-th` element from each inner tuple in `tuples`. Given that `i` is 1, it will take the second element from each inner tuple (since indexing starts at 0).

The impact on the program is that `elements_at_position` will now contain the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, which could be different from its previous value if the second elements are not the same as the elements it previously contained.

The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, `tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, and `i` retain their initial values or properties.

However, since `avg` is defined as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and `elements_at_position` has been updated, the value of `avg` also changes. It will now be the average of the second elements of the inner tuples, which is `sum([t[i] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`.

Given that `i` is 1, `avg` is now `sum([t[1] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`.

The output state is:
- `tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length.
- `num_elements` is greater than 1 and equal to the length of the inner tuples.
- `averages` is a list containing at least one average.
- `i` is 1.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.
- `avg` is `sum([t[1] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, `num_elements` is greater than 1 and equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is a list containing at least one average, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum([t[1] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`**
