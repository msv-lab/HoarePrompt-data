The list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]` generates a new list containing the elements at position `i` from each tuple in `tuples`. 

The value of `i` is 0, so `elements_at_position` will be a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.**
