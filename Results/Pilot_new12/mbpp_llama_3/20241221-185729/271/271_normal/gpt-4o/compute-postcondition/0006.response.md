According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. If `i` is less than `num_elements`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `num_elements` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `num_elements` must be greater than 1.

Additionally, since `averages` is a list containing `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, for the next iteration, `elements_at_position` should contain the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` should be `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

State: **`tuples` is a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, `num_elements` is greater than 1 and equal to the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is a list containing at least one average, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
