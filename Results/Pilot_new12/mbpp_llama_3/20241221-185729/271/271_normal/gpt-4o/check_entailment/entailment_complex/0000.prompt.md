You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples with all inner tuples of the same length, `num_elements` is the length of the inner tuples, `averages` is a list where each element is the average of the elements at the corresponding position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. If `tuples` is empty, `averages` remains an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns a list of averages where each element is the average of the elements at the corresponding position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, if `tuples` is not empty, otherwise it returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the mean of the elements at the same position across all inner tuples in the input `tuples`. If `tuples` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The input `tuples` is expected to be a tuple of tuples, with all inner tuples having the same length and containing numbers. The function handles cases where `tuples` has one or more inner tuples, and it correctly calculates the averages for each position. It does not perform any error checking or handling for cases where the inner tuples may have different lengths or contain non-numeric values. The state of the program after execution includes the input `tuples` remaining unchanged, and the output list of averages being returned, with its length equal to the length of the inner tuples in `tuples` if `tuples` is not empty, and being an empty list otherwise.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
