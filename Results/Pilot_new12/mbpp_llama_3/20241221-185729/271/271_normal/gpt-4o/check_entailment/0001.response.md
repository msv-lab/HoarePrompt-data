Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the described functionality. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The function first determines the number of elements in each tuple by checking the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`). This assumes that all tuples have the same length, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.
2. It then initializes an empty list `averages` to store the calculated averages.
3. The function uses a loop to iterate over each position in the tuples (`for i in range(num_elements):`).
4. For each position, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).
5. It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).
6. The calculated average is appended to the `averages` list.
7. Finally, the function returns the `averages` list.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Tuples with different lengths are not handled, but this is not a requirement according to the problem description.
* Tuples containing non-numeric values would raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum, but this is also not a requirement according to the problem description.
* The program works correctly for tuples with zero or negative values.

Since the program implements the described functionality correctly and handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
