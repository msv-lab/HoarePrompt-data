Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. It calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input and returns these averages as a list. 

The program first checks the number of elements in the first tuple and assumes that all tuples have the same length. It then iterates over each position in the tuples, calculates the average of the elements at that position across all tuples, and appends this average to the result list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. The function also handles the case where the input tuple is empty, in which case it returns an empty list.

The program description and output hints also agree with the code's functionality. The code does not perform any error checking for cases where the inner tuples may have different lengths or contain non-numeric values, but based on the assumption that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

In summary, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement, and the provided unit tests and output hints confirm its correctness. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
