Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. Here's a breakdown of why the function works as expected:

1. It first determines the number of elements in each tuple by checking the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`). This assumes that all tuples have the same length.

2. It then iterates over each position in the tuples using a for loop (`for i in range(num_elements)`).

3. For each position, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).

4. It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).

5. The calculated average is then appended to the `averages` list.

6. Finally, the function returns the `averages` list, which contains the average of corresponding values from each tuple.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, including tuples with different lengths and values. The function correctly handles these cases and produces the expected output.

In general, the function should work correctly for any input tuple of tuples where all tuples have the same length, as long as the input tuples contain numeric values (either integers or floats). 

The code is well-structured, readable, and efficient, making it a correct solution to the problem. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to handle cases where the input tuples have different lengths or contain non-numeric values. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, additional error checking may be necessary to make the function more robust. 

But based on the given problem description, the code seems to be correct.
