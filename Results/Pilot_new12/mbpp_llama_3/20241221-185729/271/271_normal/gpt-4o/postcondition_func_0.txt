The function calculates and returns a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the mean of the elements at the same position across all inner tuples in the input `tuples`. If `tuples` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The input `tuples` is expected to be a tuple of tuples, with all inner tuples having the same length and containing numbers. The function handles cases where `tuples` has one or more inner tuples, and it correctly calculates the averages for each position. It does not perform any error checking or handling for cases where the inner tuples may have different lengths or contain non-numeric values. The state of the program after execution includes the input `tuples` remaining unchanged, and the output list of averages being returned, with its length equal to the length of the inner tuples in `tuples` if `tuples` is not empty, and being an empty list otherwise.
