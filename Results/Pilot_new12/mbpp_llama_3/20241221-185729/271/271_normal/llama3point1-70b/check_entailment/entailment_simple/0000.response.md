Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples `tuples` as input.
2. It uses the `zip(*tuples)` expression to transpose the tuples, which means it groups the elements from the same position across all inner tuples together.
3. It then uses a list comprehension to calculate the average for each group of elements. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of the elements in the group, and `len(tuples)` gives the number of tuples, which is also the number of elements in each group since all inner tuples have the same length.
4. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the length, and the result is returned as a list of averages.

For example, if the input is `tuples = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the `zip(*tuples)` expression will return `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`. The list comprehension will then calculate the average for each group: `[(1+4+7)/3, (2+5+8)/3, (3+6+9)/3] = [12/3, 15/3, 18/3] = [4, 5, 6]`.

Since the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
