Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError when the input tuple is empty or any of the inner tuples are empty. Additionally, the program will truncate the result to the length of the shortest inner tuple if the input tuple contains inner tuples of different lengths due to the behavior of the zip function.

For example, if the input is `func_1(((1, 2), (3,)))`, the function will return `[2.0]` instead of raising an error or handling the different length inner tuples.

Another case where the program does not work as expected is when the input contains non-numeric values. The function will raise a TypeError if it encounters a non-numeric value when trying to calculate the sum.

To handle these cases, the function should include error checking and handling mechanisms to ensure that it behaves correctly for all potential inputs. 

However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the main issue is with the handling of tuples of different lengths. According to the problem description, the function should return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. If the inner tuples are of different lengths, the function should either raise an error or pad the shorter tuples with some default value (e.g., zero). The current implementation does not meet this requirement. 

Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
