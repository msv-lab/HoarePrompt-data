You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Output hints: The function calculates and returns a list of averages from the input tuple of tuples, where each average is the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples. It accepts a tuple of tuples with numbers as input and returns a list of averages. The function handles tuples with inner tuples of the same length and calculates the average for each position. If the input tuple is empty or any of the inner tuples are empty, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to calculate the average. Additionally, if the input tuple contains inner tuples of different lengths, the function will truncate the result to the length of the shortest inner tuple due to the behavior of the zip function. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric values in the input tuples, so it will raise a TypeError if it encounters a non-numeric value when trying to calculate the sum.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
