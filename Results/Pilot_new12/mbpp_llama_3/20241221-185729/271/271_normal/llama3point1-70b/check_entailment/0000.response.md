Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tuples)` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression transposes the tuples, so that the nth elements of each tuple are grouped together. For example, if `tuples = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, then `zip(*tuples)` would yield `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`.
- The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` then calculates the sum of each group and divides it by the total number of tuples, effectively computing the average.

This approach works for tuples of any length and any number of tuples, as long as all tuples have the same length (which is a requirement for `zip` to work correctly).

For example, if `tuples = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the function would correctly return `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`, which are the averages of the corresponding values in each position.

The code handles different potential cases correctly, including:

- Tuples with different lengths (although this would actually cause a `zip` error if the lengths are not the same, it's worth noting that the problem description implies that all tuples should be of the same length).
- Tuples with non-numeric values (this would cause a `TypeError` when trying to sum the values, but again, the problem description implies that the tuples contain numbers).
- Empty tuples or no tuples at all (this would cause a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the average, but it's also not a valid input according to the problem description).

In summary, the code correctly implements the required functionality for the specified problem description, assuming that the input is valid (i.e., a tuple of tuples with the same length, containing numbers).
