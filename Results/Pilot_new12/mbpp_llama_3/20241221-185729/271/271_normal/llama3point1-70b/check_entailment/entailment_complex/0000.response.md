Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly calculates and returns a list of averages from the input tuple of tuples, where each average is the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description assumes valid input, which means the input will always be a tuple of tuples with numbers, and all inner tuples will have the same length. Under these assumptions, the function will work as expected.

2. **Average Calculation**: The function uses the `zip(*tuples)` expression to transpose the input tuple of tuples, grouping numbers from the same position across all inner tuples together. It then uses a list comprehension to calculate the average for each group of numbers.

3. **Correct Formula for Average**: The average is calculated using the formula `sum(val) / len(tuples)`, where `val` is a tuple of numbers from the same position across all inner tuples, and `len(tuples)` is the total number of inner tuples. This formula correctly calculates the average of the numbers in each position.

4. **Output**: The function returns a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples. This matches the output requirement specified in the problem description.

Given that the input is always valid and that the function correctly calculates and returns the averages as specified, the program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description.
