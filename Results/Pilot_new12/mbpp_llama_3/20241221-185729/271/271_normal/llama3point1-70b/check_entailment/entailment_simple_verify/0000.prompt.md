You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tuples)` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression transposes the tuples, so that the nth elements of each tuple are grouped together. For example, if `tuples = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, then `zip(*tuples)` would yield `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`.
- The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` then calculates the sum of each group and divides it by the total number of tuples, effectively computing the average.

This approach works for tuples of any length and any number of tuples, as long as all tuples have the same length (which is a requirement for `zip` to work correctly).

For example, if `tuples = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the function would correctly return `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`, which are the averages of the corresponding values in each position.

The code handles different potential cases correctly, including:

- Tuples with different lengths (although this would actually cause a `zip` error if the lengths are not the same, it's worth noting that the problem description implies that all tuples should be of the same length).
- Tuples with non-numeric values (this would cause a `TypeError` when trying to sum the values, but again, the problem description implies that the tuples contain numbers).
- Empty tuples or no tuples at all (this would cause a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate the average, but it's also not a valid input according to the problem description).

In summary, the code correctly implements the required functionality for the specified problem description, assuming that the input is valid (i.e., a tuple of tuples with the same length, containing numbers).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length, and all elements in the inner tuples are numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples in 'tuples'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
