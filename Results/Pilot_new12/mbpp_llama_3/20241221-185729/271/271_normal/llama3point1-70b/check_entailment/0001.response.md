Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tuples)` correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

Here's why it works:

1. `zip(*tuples)` is used to unpack the tuples and group the corresponding values together. This is a common Python idiom to transpose a list of lists or tuples.

2. The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` then calculates the sum of each group of values and divides it by the total number of tuples, effectively calculating the average.

The code handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty tuples: Although the code does not explicitly handle this case, Python will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to divide by zero, which is the expected behavior when trying to calculate the average of no values.
- Tuples with different lengths: The `zip` function stops once the shortest input iterable is exhausted, which means that if the tuples have different lengths, the averages will be calculated only up to the length of the shortest tuple.
- Tuples with non-numeric values: The `sum` function will raise a `TypeError` if the values are not numeric, which is the expected behavior when trying to calculate the average of non-numeric values.

Overall, the function correctly implements the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as expected.
