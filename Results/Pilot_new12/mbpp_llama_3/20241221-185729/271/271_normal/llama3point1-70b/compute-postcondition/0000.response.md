To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code. The expression `zip(*tuples)` transposes the tuple of tuples, so that the i-th tuple returned by `zip(*tuples)` contains the i-th element from each of the argument tuples. The `sum(val)` then calculates the sum of the elements in each of these transposed tuples, and `len(tuples)` gives the total number of inner tuples.

Given that all inner tuples have the same length and all elements in the inner tuples are numbers, the expression `sum(val) / len(tuples)` calculates the average of the numbers in each position across all inner tuples.

Therefore, the program returns a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the numbers in the same position in the inner tuples.

Output State: **The program returns a list of averages, where each average is the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples in 'tuples'.**
