The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst). After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple of two lists. The first list includes elements from index 0 up to but not including index L of 'lst', and the second list includes elements from index L to the end of 'lst'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returns a tuple of two lists where the first list contains elements before index `L` and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
