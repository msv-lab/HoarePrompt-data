The code splits the list `lst` into two parts at index `L`. The first part includes all elements from the start of the list up to, but not including, the element at index `L`. The second part includes all elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

Given that `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, we can infer the following:

- If `L` is 0, the first part will be an empty list, and the second part will be the entire list `lst`.
- If `L` equals `len(lst)`, the first part will be the entire list `lst`, and the second part will be an empty list.
- For any other value of `L` (where `0 < L < len(lst)`), the list will be split at the specified index, with the first part containing elements up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second part containing the element at index `L` and all subsequent elements.

Therefore, the program returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th index, and the second list contains elements from the `L`-th index to the end of `lst`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple of two lists: the first list includes elements from index 0 up to but not including index L of 'lst', and the second list includes elements from index L to the end of 'lst'.**
