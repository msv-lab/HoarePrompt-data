Based on the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I have evaluated the program's behavior and reasoning.

The original assessment states that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. This assessment is accurate for several reasons:

1. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and splits the list into two parts, which aligns with the problem description.
2. The code uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this, which is a correct and efficient approach.
3. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different types of elements.
4. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function splits the list into two separate lists at the specified index `L` and returns them as a tuple.

The annotated version of the code also clarifies that the function does not modify the original list `lst` and does not handle cases where `L` is negative or greater than the length of `lst` beyond what is specified by the slicing operation's behavior. However, as per the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
