Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and splits the list into two parts. The first part has a length of `L`, and the function returns both parts as a tuple.

The code uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. `lst[:L]` gets the first `L` elements of the list, and `lst[L:]` gets all elements from index `L` to the end of the list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all valid inputs.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different types of elements. Additionally, the function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `L` is equal to the length of the list (in which case the second part of the tuple would be an empty list) or when `L` is 0 (in which case the first part of the tuple would be an empty list).

Since the code handles all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description, it is considered correct.
