Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. 

The problem description asks for a function that splits a given list into two parts where the length of the first part is specified by an integer L, and the function should return the resulting lists in a tuple. The provided function `func_1` does exactly this using Python's list slicing feature.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by describing the state of the program before the function call, where lst is a list and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst). It also explains that the function returns a tuple of two lists, with the first list including elements from index 0 up to but not including index L of 'lst', and the second list including elements from index L to the end of 'lst'.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles various edge cases correctly, including when L equals the length of the list, when L is 0, and when L is greater than the length of the list. The annotated version also mentions that the function does not modify the original list and does not handle cases where L is negative or greater than the length of lst beyond what is specified by the slicing operation's behavior.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` meets the problem description and handles all potential edge cases as expected.

Final: **True**
