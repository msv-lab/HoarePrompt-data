Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` and splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. It uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this.

The line `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` returns a tuple of two lists. The first list includes elements from index 0 up to but not including index `L` of `lst`, and the second list includes elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected. For example, `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` returns `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, which is the correct splitting of the list.

Since the function always splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple, it meets the problem description and is therefore correct.
