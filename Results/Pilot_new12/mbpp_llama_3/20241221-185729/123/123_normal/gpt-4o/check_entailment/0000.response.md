Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts according to the provided length `L`. It uses Python's list slicing feature, `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`, which ensures that the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains all remaining elements.

The function handles various edge cases correctly:

- When `L` equals the length of the list, it returns a tuple with the original list as the first element and an empty list as the second.
- When `L` is 0, it returns a tuple with an empty list as the first element and the original list as the second.
- When `L` is greater than the length of the list, it does not throw an error; instead, it returns the original list as the first element and an empty list as the second.

The function works with various data types of the list elements, including integers and strings, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

Overall, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and does not exhibit any known incorrect behavior.
