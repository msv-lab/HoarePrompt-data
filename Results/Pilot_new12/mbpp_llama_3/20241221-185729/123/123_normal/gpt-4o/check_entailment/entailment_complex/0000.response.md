Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple of two lists. The first list includes elements from index 0 up to but not including index `L` of `lst`, and the second list includes elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This is achieved using Python's list slicing operation `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `L` is 0 (resulting in an empty first list and the original list as the second) and when `L` equals the length of `lst` (resulting in the original list as the first and an empty list as the second).

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3) == ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to handle cases where `L` is negative or greater than the length of `lst`, as these cases are not specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the specified index `L` and returns the resulting lists as a tuple, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
