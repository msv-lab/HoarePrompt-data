Correctness: **True**

The code provided is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` and splits the list into two parts at the specified index `L`, returning the resulting lists as a tuple. 

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list, where `lst[:L]` returns all elements from index 0 up to but not including index `L`, and `lst[L:]` returns all elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

The code handles all potential edge cases, including when `L` is 0 (resulting in an empty first list and the original list as the second), when `L` equals the length of `lst` (resulting in the original list as the first and an empty list as the second), and all cases in between.

The function does not modify the original list `lst` and the slicing operation's behavior handles cases where `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, which would result in the original list as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second.

The provided output hints agree with the code's behavior and the examples support this assessment. Given the assumption that the input will be valid, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
