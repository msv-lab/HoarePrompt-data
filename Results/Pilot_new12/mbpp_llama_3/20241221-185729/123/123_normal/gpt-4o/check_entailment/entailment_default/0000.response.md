Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided does exactly what the problem description specifies. It takes a list and an integer `L` as input and splits the list into two parts at the specified index `L`. The first part of the list includes all elements from index 0 up to but not including index `L`, and the second part includes all elements from index `L` to the end of the list. The function returns these two parts as a tuple.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and also mention edge cases, such as when `L` is 0 or equals the length of the list. The code handles these cases as expected, returning an empty list as the first element of the tuple if `L` is greater than the list's length, due to the slicing operation's behavior.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid, the code will not encounter any errors due to the type or structure of the input. It will always receive a list and a positive integer (or an integer that is within the range of the list's indices), and it will operate correctly on these inputs.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correct operation of the function. For instance, `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` correctly returns `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, splitting the list at the specified index.

Overall, the code accurately implements the described functionality for all potential valid cases, making it correct.
