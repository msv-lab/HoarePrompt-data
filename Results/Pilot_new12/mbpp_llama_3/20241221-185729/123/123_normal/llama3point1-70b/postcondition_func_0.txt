The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`. If `L` is 0, the first list will be empty and the second list will be the entire original list. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst` and the second list will be empty. The function effectively splits the input list `lst` into two parts at the index `L`, without modifying the original list.
