The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(lst, L)` correctly splits the input list `lst` into two parts at the index `L` and returns them as a tuple. The original assessment correctly handles edge cases such as when `L` is equal to or greater than the length of the list.

The output hints provided also match the functionality of the code, describing the expected behavior for different values of `L`. The hints correctly note that the function splits the list without modifying the original list and handles cases where `L` is 0 or equals the length of `lst`.

The code follows the problem description and behaves as expected for all potential cases, and the output hints do not reveal any inconsistencies with the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the output hints, and the code, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
