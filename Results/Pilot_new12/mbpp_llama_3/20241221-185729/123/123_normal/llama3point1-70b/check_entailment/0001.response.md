Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the first `L` elements of the original list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The code uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list into two parts. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the expression `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`.

This program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `L` is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of the original list.
* When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first list contains all elements of the original list and the second list is empty.
* When `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first list contains all elements of the original list and the second list is empty.

For example:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)` returns `([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])`
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0)` returns `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)` returns `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10)` returns `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, its correctness is **True**.
