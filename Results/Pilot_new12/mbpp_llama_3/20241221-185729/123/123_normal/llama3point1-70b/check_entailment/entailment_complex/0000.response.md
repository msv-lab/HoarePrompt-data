Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` as inputs and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses Python's list slicing feature (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) to split the input list into two parts. This ensures that the first `L` elements are included in the first list and the remaining elements are included in the second list.
2. The function handles the edge cases correctly:
	* If `L` is 0, the first list will be empty (`[]`) and the second list will be the entire original list (`lst`).
	* If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst` and the second list will be empty (`[]`).
3. The function does not modify the original list, as required by the problem description.
4. The function assumes that the input will be valid, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it does not include error handling for invalid inputs.

Overall, the program accurately implements the required functionality and handles the expected edge cases, making it correct according to the problem description.
