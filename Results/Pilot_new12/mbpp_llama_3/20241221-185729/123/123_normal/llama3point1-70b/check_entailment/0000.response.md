Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple is a slice of the original list from the start to index `L`, and the second list is a slice from index `L` to the end of the original list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it uses Python's built-in list slicing feature, which automatically handles edge cases such as when `L` is equal to the length of the list, or when `L` is greater than the length of the list.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 3`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function will return `(lst, [])`. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the function will return `(lst, [])` because `lst[L:]` will be an empty list.

In all cases, the function behaves as expected and follows the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
