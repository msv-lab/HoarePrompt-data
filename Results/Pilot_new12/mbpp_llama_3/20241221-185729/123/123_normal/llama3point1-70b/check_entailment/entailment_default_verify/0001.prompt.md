You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the first `L` elements of the original list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The code uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list into two parts. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the expression `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`.

This program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `L` is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of the original list.
* When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first list contains all elements of the original list and the second list is empty.
* When `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first list contains all elements of the original list and the second list is empty.

For example:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)` returns `([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])`
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0)` returns `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)` returns `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`
* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10)` returns `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`. If `L` is 0, the first list will be empty and the second list will be the entire original list. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst` and the second list will be empty. The function effectively splits the input list `lst` into two parts at the index `L`, without modifying the original list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
