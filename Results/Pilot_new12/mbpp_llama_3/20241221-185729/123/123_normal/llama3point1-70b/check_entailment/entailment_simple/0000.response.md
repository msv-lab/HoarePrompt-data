Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. It then returns these two parts as a tuple.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters.
2. The line `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` splits the list `lst` into two parts using Python's list slicing feature.
   - `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list that includes all elements up to, but not including, the `L`-th element (0-indexed). This slice represents the first part of the list with length `L`.
   - `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list that includes all elements from the `L`-th index to the end of the list. This slice represents the second part of the list, which contains the remaining elements after the first `L` elements.
3. The two slices are returned as a tuple, fulfilling the requirement that the function should return the resulting lists in a tuple.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`), the program correctly implements the specified functionality without needing to handle error cases for invalid inputs.
