Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes a list and an integer `L` as input, splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. 

The function handles various cases as expected: 
- If `L` is 0, the first list in the tuple will be empty, and the second list will be the entire original list.
- If `L` equals the length of the input list, the first list will contain all elements of the input list, and the second list will be empty.
- For any other value of `L` between 0 and the length of the input list, the function splits the list at the specified index.

The output hints also align with the expected behavior of the function, and no potential cases are overlooked where the program does not work as expected. The function effectively splits the input list into two parts at the index `L` without modifying the original list, as described in the problem. 

Therefore, given that the input will be valid, the code works correctly for every potential case.
