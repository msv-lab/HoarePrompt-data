The program returns two values: the first slice of the list `lst` from the start up to but not including index `L`, and the second slice of the list `lst` from index `L` to the end. 
Given that `L` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, the first slice `lst[:L]` will contain the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second slice `lst[L:]` will contain the remaining elements of `lst`. If `L` equals `len(lst)`, the first slice will contain all elements of `lst` and the second slice will be an empty list. If `L` equals `0`, the first slice will be an empty list and the second slice will contain all elements of `lst`.
Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the first L elements of 'lst' and the second list contains the remaining elements of 'lst'.**
