The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of comparable elements. After execution, it returns a new sorted list containing all elements from these input lists in ascending order, without modifying the original lists. This includes handling potential edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared (e.g., numbers and strings). The function does not perform any error checking on the input types, so it will throw an error if the lists contain non-comparable elements or if the inputs are not lists. The overall state of the program after conclusion is that the original lists remain unchanged, and a new sorted list is returned.
