To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we must check if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as input and returns a sorted list containing all elements from these lists. Here's how it works:

1. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) into a single list.
2. It then applies the `sorted()` function to this concatenated list, which sorts the elements in ascending order.
3. The sorted list is returned as the result.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this function works as expected for any three lists of comparable elements, regardless of whether the input lists are sorted or not.

The key reasons why this program is correct are:

- It merges the three input lists into one, adhering to the first part of the problem description.
- It sorts the merged list, fulfilling the second part of the problem description.
- It handles lists of comparable elements, which can include numbers, strings, or other types that support comparison, allowing it to work with a variety of potential inputs.

Therefore, considering the problem description and the functionality of the provided program, it can be concluded that the program always does what the problem description asks for, under the assumption of valid input.

Correctness: **True**.
