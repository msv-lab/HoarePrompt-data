Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. It achieves this by concatenating the three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) using the `+` operator and then sorting the resulting list using the `sorted` function. 

The function does not perform any error checking on the input types, which means it assumes that the inputs will be lists and that the elements within these lists are comparable. Given this assumption, the function works correctly for all potential cases, including handling empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared (such as numbers and strings).

The output hints confirm that the function returns a new sorted list without modifying the original lists, as required by the problem description. Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., three lists with comparable elements), the function will always produce the expected output.

Therefore, under the given assumptions about valid input, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case.
