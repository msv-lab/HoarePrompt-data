Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, merges them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then returns a sorted version of this merged list using the `sorted()` function.

Here's why this program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Merging Lists**: The program correctly merges the three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single list using `list1 + list2 + list3`. This operation concatenates all elements from the three lists into one list, regardless of their original order or whether they were sorted.

2. **Sorting**: The merged list is then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the returned list contains all elements from the input lists, arranged in ascending order. The `sorted()` function in Python can handle lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared, such as numbers and strings, although the comparison may not always yield the expected result due to the nature of how Python compares different data types.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program implicitly handles edge cases like empty lists and lists with duplicate elements correctly. If any of the input lists are empty, the `+` operator simply ignores them, resulting in a merged list that contains elements from the non-empty lists. For lists with duplicate elements, the `sorted()` function correctly places these elements next to each other in the sorted output list.

4. **Non-Modification of Original Lists**: The function does not modify the original input lists. It creates a new list by merging the input lists and then sorts this new list, leaving the original lists unchanged.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., the inputs are lists that contain comparable elements), the program does not need to perform error checking on the input types. Therefore, under the constraints provided, the program operates as intended without concerns for input validation.

In summary, the program follows the problem description by merging three lists into a single sorted list, handling edge cases appropriately, and not modifying the original lists, all under the assumption of valid input.
