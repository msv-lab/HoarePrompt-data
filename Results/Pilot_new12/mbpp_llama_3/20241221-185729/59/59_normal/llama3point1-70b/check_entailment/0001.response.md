Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function utilizes the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of a given iterable in a specific order - Ascending or Descending.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **List Concatenation**: The function first concatenates the three input lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` using the `+` operator. This operation results in a new list containing all elements from the input lists.

2. **Sorting**: The concatenated list is then passed to the `sorted` function, which sorts the elements in ascending order by default. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list and leaves the original lists unchanged.

The code handles various potential cases, including:

- **Empty Lists**: If one or more of the input lists are empty, the function will still work correctly and return a sorted list containing elements from the non-empty lists.
- **Duplicate Elements**: If there are duplicate elements across the input lists, the function will include all duplicates in the sorted output list.
- **Negative Numbers and Zero**: The function can handle lists containing negative numbers and zero, sorting them correctly.
- **Non-Numeric Elements**: However, it's worth noting that if the lists contain non-numeric elements (like strings or a mix of data types), the function may not work as expected because Python's `sorted` function can't compare different data types directly. But based on the problem description, it seems to be focused on numeric lists.

Since the function correctly merges and sorts three lists in all potential numeric cases, and assuming the lists contain comparable elements (e.g., all integers or all floats), the code is considered correct.
