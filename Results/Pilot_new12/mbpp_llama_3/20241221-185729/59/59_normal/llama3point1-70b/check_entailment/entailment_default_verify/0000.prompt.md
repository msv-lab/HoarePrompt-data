You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. It uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the three input lists into one list.

The function works as expected for all possible input cases. For example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8])`, the function will return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which is the correct sorted list. 

The function also handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers. For instance, `func_1([1, 2, 2], [-1, 0], [3, 4])` will return `[-1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, and `func_1([], [], [])` will return `[]`. 

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of comparable elements. After execution, it returns a new sorted list containing all elements from these input lists in ascending order, without modifying the original lists. This includes handling potential edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared (e.g., numbers and strings). The function does not perform any error checking on the input types, so it will throw an error if the lists contain non-comparable elements or if the inputs are not lists. The overall state of the program after conclusion is that the original lists remain unchanged, and a new sorted list is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
