You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function utilizes the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of a given iterable in a specific order - Ascending or Descending.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **List Concatenation**: The function first concatenates the three input lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` using the `+` operator. This operation results in a new list containing all elements from the input lists.

2. **Sorting**: The concatenated list is then passed to the `sorted` function, which sorts the elements in ascending order by default. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list and leaves the original lists unchanged.

The code handles various potential cases, including:

- **Empty Lists**: If one or more of the input lists are empty, the function will still work correctly and return a sorted list containing elements from the non-empty lists.
- **Duplicate Elements**: If there are duplicate elements across the input lists, the function will include all duplicates in the sorted output list.
- **Negative Numbers and Zero**: The function can handle lists containing negative numbers and zero, sorting them correctly.
- **Non-Numeric Elements**: However, it's worth noting that if the lists contain non-numeric elements (like strings or a mix of data types), the function may not work as expected because Python's `sorted` function can't compare different data types directly. But based on the problem description, it seems to be focused on numeric lists.

Since the function correctly merges and sorts three lists in all potential numeric cases, and assuming the lists contain comparable elements (e.g., all integers or all floats), the code is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, which are lists of comparable elements. After execution, it returns a new sorted list containing all elements from these input lists in ascending order, without modifying the original lists. This includes handling potential edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of different data types that can be compared (e.g., numbers and strings). The function does not perform any error checking on the input types, so it will throw an error if the lists contain non-comparable elements or if the inputs are not lists. The overall state of the program after conclusion is that the original lists remain unchanged, and a new sorted list is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
