Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. It uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the three input lists into one list.

The function works as expected for all possible input cases. For example, if we call `func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8])`, the function will return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which is the correct sorted list. 

The function also handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers. For instance, `func_1([1, 2, 2], [-1, 0], [3, 4])` will return `[-1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, and `func_1([], [], [])` will return `[]`. 

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.
