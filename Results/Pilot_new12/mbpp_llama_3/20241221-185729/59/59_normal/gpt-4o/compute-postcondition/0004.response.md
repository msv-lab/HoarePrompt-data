Functionality: **This function merges three input lists, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, into a single list and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order. The function accepts lists of comparable elements, such as integers or strings, and does not modify the original input lists. The returned list will be empty if all input lists are empty. The function handles lists of varying lengths and does not impose any restrictions on the types of comparable elements that can be included in the input lists. After the function concludes, the state of the program will be updated with the returned sorted list, while the original input lists remain unchanged.**
