Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It merges three input lists into a single sorted list in ascending order. The function handles lists of varying lengths and does not impose any restrictions on the types of comparable elements that can be included in the input lists. The original input lists remain unchanged, and the function returns a new sorted list.

The code is implemented using built-in Python functions, `+` for list concatenation and `sorted()` for sorting the combined list. These functions are efficient and reliable for handling various types of input lists, including integers and strings, as long as the elements within each list are comparable.

All the provided test cases demonstrate the correct functionality of the code. For instance, the function correctly merges and sorts lists with duplicate elements, as shown in `assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]) == [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12]`. Additionally, the function handles lists of different lengths and correctly sorts the combined list.

Since the problem description assumes valid input (i.e., lists of comparable elements), and all the examples provided work correctly, it can be concluded that the code is correct and meets the requirements for every potential case.
