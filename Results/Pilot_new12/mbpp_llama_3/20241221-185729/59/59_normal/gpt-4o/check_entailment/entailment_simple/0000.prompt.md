You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110], [19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154], [24, 26, 54, 48]) == [4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]
assert func_1([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], [2, 5, 7, 11], [1, 4, 7, 8, 12]) == [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12]
assert func_1([18, 14, 10, 9, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1], [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 25, 58], [12, 74, 9, 50, 61, 41]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 12, 14, 14, 18, 22, 25, 25, 35, 41, 50, 58, 61, 65, 74, 75, 85]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns a sorted list, which is a sorted combination of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, in ascending order

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
