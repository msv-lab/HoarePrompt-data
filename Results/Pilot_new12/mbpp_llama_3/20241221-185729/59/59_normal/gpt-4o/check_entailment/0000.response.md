Correctness: **True**

The provided code merges three lists into a single sorted list. It first combines the three input lists into a single list using the `+` operator. Then, it sorts the combined list in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the `+` operator and `sorted()` function will still work as expected.
* Duplicate elements: The code correctly handles duplicate elements across the three input lists.
* Negative numbers: The code correctly sorts lists containing negative numbers.
* Floating-point numbers: The code correctly sorts lists containing floating-point numbers.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the code for various input scenarios.

Overall, the code is simple, efficient, and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
