Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by first combining the three input lists into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorting the combined list using the built-in `sorted` function. 

The provided unit tests cover various cases, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different lengths. The function seems to handle these cases correctly, returning a sorted list that includes all elements from the input lists.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. The `sorted` function in Python is stable, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved. However, in this case, since we are simply sorting a list of numbers, the stability of the sort is not relevant.

The time complexity of the function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the total number of elements in the three input lists. This is the best possible time complexity for a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Overall, the function seems to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and no potential cases were found where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
