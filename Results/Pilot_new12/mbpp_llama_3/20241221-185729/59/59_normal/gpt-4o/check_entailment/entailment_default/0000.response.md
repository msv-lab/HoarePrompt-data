Correctness: **True**.

The code merges three input lists into a single sorted list, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which correctly sorts the combined list in ascending order. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior, such as handling lists of varying lengths and not modifying the original input lists.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with varying lengths. The function also handles the case where all input lists are empty, returning an empty list as expected.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or is empty. The code correctly handles the merging and sorting of the input lists, and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to behave incorrectly.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases, making the correctness **True**.
