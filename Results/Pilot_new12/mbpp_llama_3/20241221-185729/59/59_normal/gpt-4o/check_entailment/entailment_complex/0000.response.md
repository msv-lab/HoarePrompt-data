Correctness: **True**

The program correctly merges three input lists into a single sorted list. Here's why it always works as expected:

1. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted` function.
2. The `sorted` function returns a new list that contains all the elements from the combined list in ascending order.
3. The function does not modify the original input lists, as it creates a new list and returns it.
4. The function handles lists of varying lengths and does not impose any restrictions on the types of comparable elements that can be included in the input lists.
5. The function returns an empty list if all input lists are empty, which aligns with the expected behavior.
6. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different lengths.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles different input scenarios correctly, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
