The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains consecutive integers in ascending order. The function returns `True` if the list is non-empty and contains consecutive integers, and `False` otherwise. This includes cases where the input list is empty, contains duplicate or non-consecutive integers, or contains a single element. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a boolean result. It handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements that are not consecutive. The function's return value indicates the presence or absence of consecutive integers in the input list.
