To determine the state at the start of the for loop, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over a range of indices from 0 to the second last index of `lst_sorted`.

For the loop to execute, `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, because if it had only 1 element, `len(lst_sorted) - 1` would be 0, and the range would be empty. The state of `lst` is given as not empty, but this does not directly affect the loop since the loop iterates over `lst_sorted`. The state of `lst_sorted` being a sorted list of integers in ascending order is relevant for understanding its contents but does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` is 0 because the `range` function starts from 0 by default.

So, for the loop to execute, we need:
- `lst_sorted` to have at least 2 elements.
- `i` to be initialized to 0, which will be the case at the start of the loop.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as `lst` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
