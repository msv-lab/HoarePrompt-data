According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. If `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `lst_sorted` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `lst_sorted` must have at least 3 elements, but since `i` is now at the second last element, `lst_sorted` can have at least 3 elements and the loop will still execute, but to be precise `lst_sorted` must have at least 4 elements for `i` to increase from 1 to 2 and the loop to still have one more iteration left after this one. However, this level of precision is already provided given that `i` increased by one to be 2, and the given conditions. So it will be stated simply that the list has at least 3 elements.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as `lst` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
