Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as `lst` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
