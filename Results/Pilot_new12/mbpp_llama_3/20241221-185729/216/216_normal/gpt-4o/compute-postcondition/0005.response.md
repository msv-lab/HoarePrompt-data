Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as `lst` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. The current value of `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, meaning the difference between the first two elements of `lst_sorted` is not 1.**
