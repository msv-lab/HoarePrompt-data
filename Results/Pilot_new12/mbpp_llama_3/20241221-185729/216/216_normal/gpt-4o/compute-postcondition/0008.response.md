According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst_sorted`. If `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The loop condition `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1` must still be true, which means `lst_sorted` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is now 1 and `len(lst_sorted) - 1` must be greater than 1). Additionally, the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in `lst_sorted` is still relevant, but now it applies to the new value of `i`. So, the difference between the element at index `1 + 1 = 2` and the element at index `1` in `lst_sorted` must be 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as `lst` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, and the difference between the element at index `2` and the element at index `1` in `lst_sorted` is 1**
