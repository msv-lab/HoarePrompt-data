The code statement `lst_sorted = sorted(lst)` creates a new sorted list from the original list `lst`. The `sorted()` function sorts the elements of `lst` in ascending order and assigns the result to `lst_sorted`.

The original list `lst` remains unchanged because the `sorted()` function does not modify the original list; instead, it returns a new sorted list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a new list containing the same integers as `lst`, but sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as `lst`.**
