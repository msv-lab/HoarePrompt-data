Based on the provided information, we can analyze the loop's behavior and determine its output state.

The loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the `lst_sorted` list is 1. If it finds a pair of elements where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns False.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe that:

* `lst` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `lst_sorted` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* `i` takes on the values 0, 1, 2, and so on, up to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.
* The loop checks the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` and returns False if it finds a pair with a difference other than 1.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* If the loop completes without returning False, it means that the difference between all consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1. In this case, `lst_sorted` is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order.
* If the loop returns False, it means that the difference between some consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is not 1.
* The original value of `lst` is still a list of integers and is not empty.
* The current value of `lst_sorted` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original `lst`.
* The loop variable `i` is not relevant after the loop finishes.

Considering these points, we can determine the loop's output state:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original `lst`. If the loop returns False, then `lst_sorted` is not a list of consecutive integers.**
