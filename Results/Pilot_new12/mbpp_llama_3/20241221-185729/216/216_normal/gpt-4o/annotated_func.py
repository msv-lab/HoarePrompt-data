#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and the list is not empty

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original `lst`. If the loop returns False, then `lst_sorted` is not a list of consecutive integers.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that lst_sorted is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original lst.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains consecutive integers in ascending order. The function returns `True` if the list is non-empty and contains consecutive integers, and `False` otherwise. This includes cases where the input list is empty, contains duplicate or non-consecutive integers, or contains a single element. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a boolean result. It handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements that are not consecutive. The function's return value indicates the presence or absence of consecutive integers in the input list.
