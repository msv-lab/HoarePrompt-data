Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It handles various edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements that are not consecutive.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Handling Empty List**: The program returns `False` for an empty list, which is correct according to the problem description. An empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Handling Non-Consecutive Numbers**: The program sorts the input list and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it immediately returns `False`.

3. **Handling Duplicate Numbers**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention duplicate numbers, the program correctly handles this case. If the input list contains duplicates, the sorted list will still contain duplicates, and the program will correctly return `False` because the difference between a number and its duplicate is 0, not 1.

4. **Handling Single Element List**: The program returns `True` for a list containing a single element, which is correct according to the problem description. A list with a single element can be considered as containing consecutive numbers (trivially, as there's only one number).

5. **Handling Valid Consecutive Numbers**: The program correctly returns `True` for lists containing consecutive numbers in any order. The sorting step ensures that the numbers are processed in ascending order, regardless of their original order in the input list.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement and handles all relevant edge cases.
