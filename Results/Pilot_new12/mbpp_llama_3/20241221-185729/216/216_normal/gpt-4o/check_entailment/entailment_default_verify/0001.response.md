The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. This assessment is based on the function's ability to handle various edge cases, including empty lists, lists with consecutive numbers, lists without consecutive numbers, lists with duplicate numbers, and potentially lists with negative numbers.

Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The function indeed checks if the input list contains consecutive integers in ascending order and returns a boolean value accordingly. The code correctly handles the specified cases and does not modify the original list.

The output hints support the original assessment by confirming that the function returns `True` for lists containing consecutive integers and `False` otherwise, including edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with non-consecutive integers.

One key consideration is how the function handles lists with a single element. The original assessment suggests that the function would correctly return `True` for such cases because the loop that checks for consecutive numbers would not execute, and thus the function would return `True` without finding any non-consecutive numbers. This aligns with the problem description and the output hints, which indicate the function should return `True` if the list contains consecutive integers, implying a single-element list meets this criterion since it inherently contains consecutive integers (the single element itself).

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment is correct. The function correctly implements the logic to check for consecutive numbers in a list, considering all relevant cases as described in the problem description and supported by the output hints.

Final: **True**
