Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks if a list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns `False` as there are no numbers to check for consecutiveness.

The list is then sorted, and each pair of adjacent numbers is checked to see if their difference is 1. If a pair is found with a difference other than 1, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The function works correctly for the provided test cases:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive (4 is missing).
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive (they contain duplicates).

The function also handles edge cases correctly:

- An empty list returns `False`.
- A list with a single element returns `True` (the single element is considered to be consecutive with itself).
- A list with duplicate elements is correctly identified as not containing consecutive numbers.
- Unsorted lists are correctly handled because the function sorts the input list before checking for consecutiveness.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all possible input cases as described in the problem statement.
