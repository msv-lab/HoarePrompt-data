You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks if a list contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns `False` as there are no numbers to check for consecutiveness.

The list is then sorted, and each pair of adjacent numbers is checked to see if their difference is 1. If a pair is found with a difference other than 1, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The function works correctly for the provided test cases:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive (4 is missing).
- `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive (they contain duplicates).

The function also handles edge cases correctly:

- An empty list returns `False`.
- A list with a single element returns `True` (the single element is considered to be consecutive with itself).
- A list with duplicate elements is correctly identified as not containing consecutive numbers.
- Unsorted lists are correctly handled because the function sorts the input list before checking for consecutiveness.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and handles all possible input cases as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original `lst`. If the loop returns False, then `lst_sorted` is not a list of consecutive integers.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that lst_sorted is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original lst.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
