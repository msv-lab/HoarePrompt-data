Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks whether the input list contains consecutive numbers in ascending order. The function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns `False`. It then sorts the list and iterates over each pair of adjacent elements, checking if the difference between them is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully checks all pairs without finding any non-consecutive numbers, it returns `True`.

The output hints agree with the code, as they describe the function's behavior as returning `True` if the list is non-empty and contains consecutive integers, and `False` otherwise.

The code handles various edge cases correctly:

- Empty list: The function returns `False`, as specified.
- List with a single element: Although not explicitly mentioned in the output hints, the function will return `True` in this case, as a list with a single element can be considered to contain consecutive numbers (i.e., the single number itself). However, considering the problem description and the provided unit tests, it seems that the function should return `True` for a list with a single element because the list does contain consecutive numbers (only one number, so there are no non-consecutive pairs). But the description also includes the test `assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False` indicating the list should be strictly increasing.
- List with multiple elements that are not consecutive: The function correctly returns `False` in such cases.
- List with duplicate or non-consecutive integers: The function also correctly handles these cases, returning `False`.

Considering all these points, the code seems to correctly implement the desired functionality, checking for consecutive numbers in a list. It handles various edge cases and behaves as specified in the output hints and the problem description.
