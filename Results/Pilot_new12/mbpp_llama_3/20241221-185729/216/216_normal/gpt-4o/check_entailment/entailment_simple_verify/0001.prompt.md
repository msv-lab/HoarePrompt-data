You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list and iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function correctly returns `False` for empty lists.
- Lists with consecutive numbers: The function correctly returns `True` for lists with consecutive numbers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Lists without consecutive numbers: The function correctly returns `False` for lists without consecutive numbers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`.
- Lists with duplicate numbers: The function correctly returns `False` for lists with duplicate numbers, such as `[1, 2, 1]`.
- Lists with negative numbers: The function would also correctly handle lists with negative numbers, such as `[-3, -2, -1, 0]`, although this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions.
- Lists with a single element: Although not explicitly tested, the function would correctly return `True` for lists with a single element, such as `[1]`, because the loop `for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):` would simply not execute, and thus the function would return `True` without finding any non-consecutive numbers. 

Overall, the function seems to be correctly implemented to check for consecutive numbers in a list, considering all edge cases and potential inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original `lst`. If the loop returns False, then `lst_sorted` is not a list of consecutive integers.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that lst_sorted is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order, containing the same elements as the original lst.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
