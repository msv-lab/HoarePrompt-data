Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first checks if the list is empty and returns False in this case. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order and checks if each number is one more than the previous number. If any pair of adjacent numbers does not meet this condition, the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive numbers, the function returns True, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program handles the edge case of an empty list by returning False.
2. By sorting the list, the program ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, which makes it easier to check for consecutiveness.
3. The loop checks each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list. If any pair of numbers is not consecutive (i.e., the difference between them is not 1), the function returns False.
4. If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive numbers, the function returns True, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: returns False
* Lists with a single element: not explicitly tested, but would return True because the loop would not execute (len(lst_sorted) - 1 would be 0)
* Lists with multiple elements: checks for consecutiveness and returns True or False accordingly

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
