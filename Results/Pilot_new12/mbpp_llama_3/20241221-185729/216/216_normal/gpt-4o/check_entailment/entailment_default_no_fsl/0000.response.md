Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct. It checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not by sorting the list first and then checking if the difference between adjacent numbers is 1. 

The code handles various edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with multiple elements that are not consecutive. It returns `False` for these cases, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

The function also correctly handles the case where the input list contains duplicate integers, as shown in the example `func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False`. This is because the function sorts the list first, which will cause the duplicate integers to be adjacent to each other, and then checks if the difference between adjacent numbers is 1.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True` and `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False`, also demonstrate that the function is working as expected.

Overall, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all potential cases.
