The original assessment correctly concludes that the provided Python function `func_1` is correct. The assessment thoroughly evaluates the function's behavior in relation to the problem description, checking for consecutive numbers in a list.

Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the original assessment, it is clear that the function is designed to:
- Handle empty lists by returning `False`.
- Sort the input list to ensure the comparison is done in ascending order, regardless of the original order of the numbers.
- Check each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list to see if their difference is 1, indicating they are consecutive.
- Return `True` if all pairs have a difference of 1 (i.e., the numbers are consecutive) and `False` otherwise.

The output hints further support the original assessment by detailing the function's expected behavior, including:
- Accepting a list of integers as input.
- Returning a boolean value indicating whether the list contains consecutive integers.
- Handling edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with non-consecutive integers.

Given this analysis, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct aligns with the problem description and the output hints. There are no indications in the output hints or the problem description that suggest the function should behave differently than described.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The function correctly checks for consecutive numbers in a list, handles edge cases appropriately, and meets all the criteria outlined in the problem description and supported by the output hints.

Final: **True**
