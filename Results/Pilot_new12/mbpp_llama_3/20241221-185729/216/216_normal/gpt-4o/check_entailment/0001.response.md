Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list and iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function correctly returns `False` for empty lists.
- Lists with consecutive numbers: The function correctly returns `True` for lists with consecutive numbers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Lists without consecutive numbers: The function correctly returns `False` for lists without consecutive numbers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`.
- Lists with duplicate numbers: The function correctly returns `False` for lists with duplicate numbers, such as `[1, 2, 1]`.
- Lists with negative numbers: The function would also correctly handle lists with negative numbers, such as `[-3, -2, -1, 0]`, although this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions.
- Lists with a single element: Although not explicitly tested, the function would correctly return `True` for lists with a single element, such as `[1]`, because the loop `for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):` would simply not execute, and thus the function would return `True` without finding any non-consecutive numbers. 

Overall, the function seems to be correctly implemented to check for consecutive numbers in a list, considering all edge cases and potential inputs.
