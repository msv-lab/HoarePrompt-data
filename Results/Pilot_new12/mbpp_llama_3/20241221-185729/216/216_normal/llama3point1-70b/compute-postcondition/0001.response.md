The given Python code snippet checks two conditions for the list `lst`: 

1. If the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the list is 1.
2. If all elements in the list are unique, which is verified by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set created from the list (since sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values).

Given that `lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the first condition `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` essentially checks if the list contains consecutive integers. 

The second condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks for uniqueness of all elements in the list. Since the list is already stated to be sorted and we are checking for consecutive integers, this condition is inherently satisfied if the first condition is true, because a list of consecutive integers cannot have duplicates.

Therefore, the program returns `True` if `lst` contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **The program returns True if the list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates, False otherwise**
