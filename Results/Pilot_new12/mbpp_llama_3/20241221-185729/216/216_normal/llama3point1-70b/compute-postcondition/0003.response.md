Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input, modifies the list by sorting it in ascending order, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sorted list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates. The function returns `True` if the list satisfies this condition, meaning the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and all integers are unique, and `False` otherwise. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and considers edge cases such as lists with a single element, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with non-consecutive integers. After the function call, the original list passed to the function will have been sorted in place, regardless of the return value.**
