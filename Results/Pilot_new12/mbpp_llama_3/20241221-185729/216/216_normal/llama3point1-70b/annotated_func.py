#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input, modifies the list by sorting it in ascending order, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sorted list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates. The function returns `True` if the list satisfies this condition, meaning the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and all integers are unique, and `False` otherwise. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and considers edge cases such as lists with a single element, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with non-consecutive integers. After the function call, the original list passed to the function will have been sorted in place, regardless of the return value.
