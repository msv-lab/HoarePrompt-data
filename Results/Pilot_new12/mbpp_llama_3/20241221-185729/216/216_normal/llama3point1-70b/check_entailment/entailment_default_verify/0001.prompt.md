You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(lst)` checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function works as follows:

1. It first sorts the list in ascending order.
2. Then it checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is equal to 1 (i.e., the numbers are consecutive).
3. Additionally, it checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list, which ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the list is already sorted, the function still works correctly.
* If the list contains duplicate numbers, the function returns `False` because the length of the list is not equal to the length of the set.
* If the list contains non-consecutive numbers, the function returns `False` because the difference between at least one pair of adjacent numbers is not equal to 1.
* If the list is empty or contains a single element, the function returns `True` because the list is considered to contain consecutive numbers (trivial case).

The function uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is equal to 1. This approach is efficient and handles lists of any size.

Overall, the function is correct and handles all potential cases according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input, modifies the list by sorting it in ascending order, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sorted list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates. The function returns `True` if the list satisfies this condition, meaning the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and all integers are unique, and `False` otherwise. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and considers edge cases such as lists with a single element, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with non-consecutive integers. After the function call, the original list passed to the function will have been sorted in place, regardless of the return value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
