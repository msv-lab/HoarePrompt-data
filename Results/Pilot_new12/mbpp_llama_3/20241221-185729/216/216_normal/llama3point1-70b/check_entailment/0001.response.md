Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(lst)` checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function works as follows:

1. It first sorts the list in ascending order.
2. Then it checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is equal to 1 (i.e., the numbers are consecutive).
3. Additionally, it checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list, which ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the list is already sorted, the function still works correctly.
* If the list contains duplicate numbers, the function returns `False` because the length of the list is not equal to the length of the set.
* If the list contains non-consecutive numbers, the function returns `False` because the difference between at least one pair of adjacent numbers is not equal to 1.
* If the list is empty or contains a single element, the function returns `True` because the list is considered to contain consecutive numbers (trivial case).

The function uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is equal to 1. This approach is efficient and handles lists of any size.

Overall, the function is correct and handles all potential cases according to the problem description.
