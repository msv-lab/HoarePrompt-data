You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why it works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Sorting the list**: The function first sorts the list `lst` in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This ensures that the list is in the correct order for checking consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking consecutive numbers**: The function then uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers is 1. This is done by iterating over the sorted list and checking if `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the length of the list.

3. **Checking uniqueness**: The function also checks if all numbers in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list (`len(lst) == len(set(lst))`). This is necessary because a list with consecutive numbers should not contain duplicates.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.

This function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Lists with positive consecutive numbers
- Lists with negative consecutive numbers
- Lists with a mix of positive and negative consecutive numbers
- Lists with duplicate numbers
- Lists with non-consecutive numbers
- Empty lists (which will return `True` because the `all()` function returns `True` for an empty iterable)

Overall, the function is well-structured and correctly implements the logic to check for consecutive numbers in a list, making it correct for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input, modifies the list by sorting it in ascending order, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sorted list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates. The function returns `True` if the list satisfies this condition, meaning the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and all integers are unique, and `False` otherwise. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and considers edge cases such as lists with a single element, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with non-consecutive integers. After the function call, the original list passed to the function will have been sorted in place, regardless of the return value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
