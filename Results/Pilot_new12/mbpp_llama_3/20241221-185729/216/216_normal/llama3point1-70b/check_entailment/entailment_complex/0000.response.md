Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` sorts the input list `lst` in ascending order, which is a necessary step to check for consecutive numbers.
2. The `all()` function is used with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent integers in the sorted list is 1. This condition ensures that the numbers are consecutive.
3. The `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition checks if all numbers in the list are unique, i.e., there are no duplicates. This is necessary because consecutive numbers cannot have duplicates.
4. The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: The `all()` function returns `True` for an empty list, and the `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition is also `True`. However, since the list is empty, the overall function returns `False`, which is correct.
* Lists with a single element: The `all()` function returns `True`, and the `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition is also `True`. In this case, the function returns `True`, which is correct because a single number is considered consecutive.
* Lists with duplicate integers: The `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition will be `False`, causing the function to return `False`, which is correct.
* Lists with non-consecutive integers: The `all()` function will return `False`, causing the function to return `False`, which is correct.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
