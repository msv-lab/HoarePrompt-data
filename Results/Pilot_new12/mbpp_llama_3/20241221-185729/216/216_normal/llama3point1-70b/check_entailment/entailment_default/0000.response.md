Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function sorts the list in ascending order and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and if all integers are unique. 

The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists. For an empty list, the function will return `True` because the `all` function with an empty iterable returns `True` and the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list.

The function also considers edge cases such as lists with a single element, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with non-consecutive integers. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `True` because the list contains consecutive integers with no gaps or duplicates. If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, the function will return `False` because the list contains a gap between 3 and 5. If the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `False` because the list contains a duplicate integer.

Overall, the function correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not, and it handles all the edge cases as expected. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
