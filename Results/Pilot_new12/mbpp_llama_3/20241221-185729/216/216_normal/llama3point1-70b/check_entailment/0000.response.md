Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why it works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Sorting the list**: The function first sorts the list `lst` in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This ensures that the list is in the correct order for checking consecutive numbers.

2. **Checking consecutive numbers**: The function then uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers is 1. This is done by iterating over the sorted list and checking if `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the length of the list.

3. **Checking uniqueness**: The function also checks if all numbers in the list are unique by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list (`len(lst) == len(set(lst))`). This is necessary because a list with consecutive numbers should not contain duplicates.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers, and `False` otherwise.

This function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Lists with positive consecutive numbers
- Lists with negative consecutive numbers
- Lists with a mix of positive and negative consecutive numbers
- Lists with duplicate numbers
- Lists with non-consecutive numbers
- Empty lists (which will return `True` because the `all()` function returns `True` for an empty iterable)

Overall, the function is well-structured and correctly implements the logic to check for consecutive numbers in a list, making it correct for every potential case.
