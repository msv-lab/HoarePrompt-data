Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first sorts the list in ascending order and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and if all integers are unique.

The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and considers edge cases such as lists with a single element, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with non-consecutive integers.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works for every potential case:

1. **Empty lists**: The function returns `False` for empty lists because `len(lst)` is 0 and `len(set(lst))` is also 0, making the condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` `True`, but the `all` function will not be executed because the range is empty. However, this case is handled correctly because an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Lists with a single element**: The function returns `True` for lists with a single element because the `all` function will not be executed and `len(lst)` equals `len(set(lst))`.

3. **Lists with duplicate integers**: The function correctly returns `False` for lists with duplicate integers because `len(lst)` is not equal to `len(set(lst))`.

4. **Lists with non-consecutive integers**: The function correctly returns `False` for lists with non-consecutive integers because the `all` function will evaluate to `False` at the first pair of adjacent integers with a difference other than 1.

5. **Lists with consecutive integers**: The function correctly returns `True` for lists with consecutive integers and no duplicates.

In summary, the function works correctly for all potential cases, including edge cases, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
