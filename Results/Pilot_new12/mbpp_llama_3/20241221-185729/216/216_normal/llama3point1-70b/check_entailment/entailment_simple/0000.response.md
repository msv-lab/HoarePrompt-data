Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the list**: The program first sorts the input list `lst` in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This is necessary to ensure that the numbers are in the correct order to check for consecutiveness.

2. **Checking for consecutiveness**: The `all()` function is used in conjunction with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list is 1. This effectively checks if the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking for duplicates**: The `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` condition checks if the list contains any duplicate numbers. In Python, a `set` automatically removes duplicates, so if the lengths of the list and the set are equal, it means there are no duplicates in the list.

The program returns `True` only if both conditions are met: the numbers are consecutive and there are no duplicates. For all other cases, it returns `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks to check if the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

Since the program correctly checks for consecutiveness and handles duplicates, and we assume that the input will always be a valid list of integers, the program is correct according to the problem description.
