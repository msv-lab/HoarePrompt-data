To calculate the output state, we need to understand the given code and initial state. The initial state is that `degrees` is a real number. The given code is `return degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. 

In this code, `math.pi` is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi, and `180` is the number of degrees in a semicircle or half of a full circle (360 degrees), which is used as a conversion factor to convert degrees to radians. 

The code multiplies the value of `degrees` by the ratio of `math.pi` to `180`, effectively converting the angle measurement from degrees to radians. 

Since `degrees` can be any real number, the result of `degrees * (math.pi / 180)` will also be a real number, representing the equivalent angle in radians.

Output State: **The program returns the real number equivalent of 'degrees' in radians**
