#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a real number.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the real number equivalent of 'degrees' in radians
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is a real number, and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it with the mathematical constant `pi/180`. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as non-numeric input or extremely large input values that may cause numerical instability. After the function concludes, the program state will be the returned radian value, with no modifications made to the original input `degrees` value. The function provides a straightforward conversion from degrees to radians, with no additional error checking or data validation.
