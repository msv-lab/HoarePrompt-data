The program is designed to convert degrees to radians by multiplying the input degree value with `math.pi / 180`. This operation directly aligns with the mathematical formula used to convert degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes a real number as input, representing the degrees to be converted, and returns the equivalent value in radians.

Given that we are assuming the input will always be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function correctly handles its intended purpose without needing to account for non-numeric input or extreme values that might cause numerical instability.

Therefore, for every potential valid case (where the input is a real number), the program does exactly what the problem description requires: it converts degrees to radians using the correct mathematical formula.

Correctness: **True**
