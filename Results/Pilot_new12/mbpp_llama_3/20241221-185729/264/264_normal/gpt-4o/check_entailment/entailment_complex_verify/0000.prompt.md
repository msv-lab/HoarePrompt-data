You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. This is achieved by multiplying the input angle in degrees by the ratio of `math.pi` to 180, which is the standard conversion factor from degrees to radians.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including 90, 60, and 120 degrees. 

Upon examining the code, it does not appear to have any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly. The function will work correctly for any real number input, including negative numbers and decimal values, as the multiplication operation and the `math.pi` constant can handle these cases.

Additionally, the function does not have any division by zero or other mathematical errors that could occur for certain inputs. 

Therefore, based on the provided unit tests and the analysis of the code, it appears that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a real number.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the real number equivalent of 'degrees' in radians
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is a real number, and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it with the mathematical constant `pi/180`. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as non-numeric input or extremely large input values that may cause numerical instability. After the function concludes, the program state will be the returned radian value, with no modifications made to the original input `degrees` value. The function provides a straightforward conversion from degrees to radians, with no additional error checking or data validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
