The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the standard formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input values.

The output hints do not indicate any potential issues with the function's correctness. They mention that the function does not handle edge cases such as non-numeric input or extremely large input values, but this is assumed to be outside the scope of the problem since we are given that the input will be valid.

Based on the output hints, the program, and the reasoning, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged. The function provides a straightforward conversion from degrees to radians, and there is no indication that it does not meet the problem description.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the function correctly implements the conversion formula, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various input values. Additionally, the output hints do not reveal any issues with the function's logic or its ability to meet the problem description.

Final: **True**
