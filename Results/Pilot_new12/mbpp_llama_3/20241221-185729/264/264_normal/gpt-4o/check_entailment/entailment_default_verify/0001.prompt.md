You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it accurately converts degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input, multiplies it by the ratio of `math.pi` to `180`, and returns the result. This is a standard method for converting degrees to radians.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input values (90, 60, and 120 degrees). The calculated values match the expected results, indicating that the function is accurate.

Since the function uses a simple and well-established formula for conversion, and the provided tests cover a reasonable range of input values, it is likely that the function will work correctly for all possible input values.

In general, this type of conversion function should work correctly for any input value that represents a valid angle in degrees, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. Without further information or edge cases to test, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is a real number, and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it with the mathematical constant `pi/180`. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as non-numeric input or extremely large input values that may cause numerical instability. After the function concludes, the program state will be the returned radian value, with no modifications made to the original input `degrees` value. The function provides a straightforward conversion from degrees to radians, with no additional error checking or data validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
