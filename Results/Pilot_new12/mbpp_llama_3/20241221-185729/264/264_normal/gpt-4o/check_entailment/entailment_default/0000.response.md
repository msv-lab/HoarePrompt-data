Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says, which is to convert degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `degrees` and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`. This is the correct mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians. 

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior. The hints mention that the function does not handle non-numeric input or extremely large input values, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly for different input values. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and meets the problem description.
