Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it accurately converts degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input, multiplies it by the ratio of `math.pi` to `180`, and returns the result. This is a standard method for converting degrees to radians.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input values (90, 60, and 120 degrees). The calculated values match the expected results, indicating that the function is accurate.

Since the function uses a simple and well-established formula for conversion, and the provided tests cover a reasonable range of input values, it is likely that the function will work correctly for all possible input values.

In general, this type of conversion function should work correctly for any input value that represents a valid angle in degrees, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. Without further information or edge cases to test, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
