Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The function uses the standard conversion factor from degrees to radians, which is `math.pi / 180`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including 90, 60, and 120 degrees. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function accepts a real number as input and returns its equivalent value in radians, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works correctly for any real number input, including negative numbers and decimal values, and that it does not have any division by zero or other mathematical errors that could occur for certain inputs.

The annotated version of the code does mention that the function does not handle any potential edge cases such as non-numeric input or extremely large input values that may cause numerical instability. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
