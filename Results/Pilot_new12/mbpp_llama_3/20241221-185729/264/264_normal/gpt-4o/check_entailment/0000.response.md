Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. This is achieved by multiplying the input angle in degrees by the ratio of `math.pi` to 180, which is the standard conversion factor from degrees to radians.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including 90, 60, and 120 degrees. 

Upon examining the code, it does not appear to have any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly. The function will work correctly for any real number input, including negative numbers and decimal values, as the multiplication operation and the `math.pi` constant can handle these cases.

Additionally, the function does not have any division by zero or other mathematical errors that could occur for certain inputs. 

Therefore, based on the provided unit tests and the analysis of the code, it appears that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
