Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conversion of degrees to radians. The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that. 

The formula used in the function, `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`, is the standard conversion formula from degrees to radians. This formula is implemented correctly in the function, and the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) confirm that the function returns the expected results for different inputs.

Given that we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a real number), the function will always return the correct equivalent of the input in radians. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
