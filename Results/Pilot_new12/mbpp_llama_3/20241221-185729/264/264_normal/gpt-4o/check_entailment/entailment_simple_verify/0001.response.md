To evaluate the correctness of the program, we must consider the provided problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians. The formula to convert degrees to radians is \(radians = degrees \times \frac{\pi}{180}\), where \(\pi\) (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and this formula is correctly implemented in the provided Python function `func_1(degrees)`.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct because it accurately implements the conversion formula and passes the provided unit tests for degrees 90, 60, and 120. This assessment seems to be accurate given the information and the standard method for converting degrees to radians.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It indicates that right before the function call, `degrees` is a real number, and the function returns the real number equivalent of `degrees` in radians. This annotation accurately reflects the expected behavior of the function given its purpose and the conversion formula used.

Given that the function correctly implements the conversion formula, passes the provided unit tests, and the annotations accurately describe its behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect. The program appears to correctly convert degrees to radians for the inputs it is expected to handle, and there are no indications of errors or mismatches with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Therefore, considering all the available information, the original assessment that the program is correct seems justified.

Final: **True**
