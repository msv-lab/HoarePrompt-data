You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a real number.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns the real number equivalent of 'degrees' in radians
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `degrees`, which is a real number, and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it with the mathematical constant `pi/180`. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as non-numeric input or extremely large input values that may cause numerical instability. After the function concludes, the program state will be the returned radian value, with no modifications made to the original input `degrees` value. The function provides a straightforward conversion from degrees to radians, with no additional error checking or data validation.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
