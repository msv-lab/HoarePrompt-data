Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns its equivalent value in radians. The function uses the mathematical constant `pi/180` to perform the conversion, which is the standard method for converting degrees to radians.

The program description states that the function should convert degrees to radians, and the provided code does exactly that. The function is straightforward and does not handle any edge cases, but as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works correctly for several example inputs, including 90, 60, and 120 degrees. The function's output matches the expected result for these cases, which suggests that the function is implemented correctly.

Additionally, the output hints provide a description of the function's behavior and do not indicate any specific cases where the function does not work as expected. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the lack of error checking or data validation does not affect the correctness of the function.

Overall, based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, it appears that the function works correctly for all valid inputs, and therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
