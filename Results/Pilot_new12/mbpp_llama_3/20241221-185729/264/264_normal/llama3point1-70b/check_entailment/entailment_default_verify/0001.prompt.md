You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * pi / 180`. The `math.pi` constant is used for precision, and the function takes the angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians.

The function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including positive and negative angles, as well as zero. For example:

- `func_1(90)` should return approximately 1.5708 (which is `math.pi / 2`), and it does.
- `func_1(-90)` should return approximately -1.5708 (which is `-math.pi / 2`), and it does.
- `func_1(0)` should return exactly 0, and it does.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. It accepts a single parameter `deg`, a real number, and returns the result of the conversion, which is calculated by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and then dividing by 180. This conversion is performed for all real number inputs, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as non-integer values, without any explicit error handling or input validation. The function's output will be a real number representing the angle in radians, regardless of the input value. Note that the function does not modify the input value `deg` and does not have any side effects. The function will return a result for all valid input values, but it does not handle cases where the input is not a real number, such as complex numbers, strings, or other non-numeric inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
