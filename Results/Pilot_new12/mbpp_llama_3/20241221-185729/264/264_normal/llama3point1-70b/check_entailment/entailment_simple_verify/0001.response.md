The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * pi / 180`. The `math.pi` constant is used for precision, and the function takes the angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding, as it states that the function returns the angle in radians, which is the result of multiplying the angle in degrees by pi and then dividing by 180. This matches the expected behavior of a function that converts degrees to radians.

Additionally, the assumptions made in the problem description, such as the input being a valid real number representing an angle in degrees, are reasonable and do not affect the correctness of the function. The function will work correctly for all possible inputs, including positive and negative angles, as well as zero, as long as the input is a valid real number.

Therefore, based on the provided code, annotations, and problem description, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.

Final: **True**
