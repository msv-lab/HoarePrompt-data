Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians by multiplying the input by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. This conversion formula is accurate for all real number inputs, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as non-integer values.

The output hints confirm that the function performs the correct calculation and does not have any side effects or modify the input value. Although the hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a real number, the problem description does not specify any requirements for handling invalid inputs. 

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential valid input case. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
