Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The function uses the correct conversion formula, which is `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`. The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function performs this conversion for all real number inputs, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as non-integer values. 

The code does not include any explicit error handling or input validation, but based on the problem description, we assume that the input will be a valid real number. The function will correctly convert any valid input angle in degrees to radians, and the output hints confirm this behavior.

There are no obvious cases where the program does not work as expected in the description. The function will return the correct result for all valid input values, such as positive, negative, and zero degrees, as well as non-integer values. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
