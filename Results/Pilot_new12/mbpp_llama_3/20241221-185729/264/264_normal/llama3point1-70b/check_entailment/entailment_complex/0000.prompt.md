You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a real number representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the angle in radians, which is the result of multiplying the angle in degrees by pi and then dividing by 180
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. It accepts a single parameter `deg`, a real number, and returns the result of the conversion, which is calculated by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and then dividing by 180. This conversion is performed for all real number inputs, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as non-integer values, without any explicit error handling or input validation. The function's output will be a real number representing the angle in radians, regardless of the input value. Note that the function does not modify the input value `deg` and does not have any side effects. The function will return a result for all valid input values, but it does not handle cases where the input is not a real number, such as complex numbers, strings, or other non-numeric inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
