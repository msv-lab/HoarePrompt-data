Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(deg)` correctly converts degrees to radians. It uses the mathematical formula `radians = degrees * π / 180`, which is a standard conversion method. The function takes an input `deg` (the angle in degrees) and returns the equivalent angle in radians.

The code is straightforward and does not have any edge cases that would cause incorrect results. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of π, which is a precise enough representation for most practical purposes.

The function will correctly handle both positive and negative degree inputs, as well as zero. It will also work with fractional degree inputs.

For example, `func_1(90)` will return approximately 1.5708 (which is π/2), and `func_1(-45)` will return approximately -0.7854 (which is -π/4).

There are no cases where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description, so the program is correct.
