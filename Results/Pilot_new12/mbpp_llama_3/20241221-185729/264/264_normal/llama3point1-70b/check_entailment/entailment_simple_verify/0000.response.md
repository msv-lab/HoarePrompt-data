To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version, let's analyze each component step by step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to convert degrees to radians. The standard formula for this conversion is \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \pi / 180 \).

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
   import math

   def func_1(deg):
       return deg * math.pi / 180
   ```
   This program uses the math library for the value of \( \pi \) and applies the conversion formula directly.

3. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the program is correct (**True**), citing that it correctly applies the formula for converting degrees to radians, handles both positive and negative inputs, and works with fractional degrees. It also mentions that the use of `math.pi` provides a precise enough representation of \( \pi \) for practical purposes.

4. **Annotated Version**:
   ```python
   import math

   # State of the program right before the function call: deg is a real number representing an angle in degrees.
   def func_1(deg):
       return deg * math.pi / 180
       # The program returns the angle in radians, which is the result of multiplying the angle in degrees by pi and then dividing by 180
   ```
   The annotations indicate that the input `deg` is expected to be a real number (which includes integers and fractions) representing an angle in degrees, and the function returns this angle converted to radians.

Given these components, let's assess the program's correctness:

- The program correctly implements the formula for converting degrees to radians, which is \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \pi / 180 \).
- The use of `math.pi` for \( \pi \) is standard and precise enough for most calculations.
- The annotated version reinforces the original assessment by specifying that the input is a real number representing degrees, which aligns with the problem description and the original program's capability to handle various types of degree inputs.
- The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a real number representing degrees) is explicitly stated, which means the program's correctness is evaluated under this constraint.

**Conclusion**: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly converts degrees to radians according to the problem description, applies the correct mathematical formula, and the annotations support this functionality under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements as specified.

Final: **True**
