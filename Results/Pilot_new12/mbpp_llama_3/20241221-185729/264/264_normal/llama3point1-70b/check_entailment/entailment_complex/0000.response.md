To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it accurately converts degrees to radians as per the problem description. The problem description requires a function to take an angle in degrees as input and return the equivalent angle in radians.

The provided Python function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees (`deg`) as input, multiplies it by `math.pi`, and then divides the result by 180. This mathematical operation is the standard formula for converting degrees to radians.

Here's why the program is correct based on the given problem description and assumptions:

1. **Correct Formula**: The program uses the correct mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, which is `radians = degrees * pi / 180`. This is implemented as `return deg * math.pi / 180` in the function.

2. **Input Handling**: The problem statement and the code's comments indicate that the input will be a real number representing an angle in degrees. Although the function does not include explicit input validation, the assumption is that the input will always be valid (a real number), which aligns with the problem's requirement.

3. **Output**: The function returns the result of the conversion, which is the angle in radians. This directly addresses the problem description's requirement to convert degrees to radians and return the result.

4. **Generality**: The function works for all real numbers, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as non-integer values, without any explicit error handling or input validation, as noted in the comments. This generality is consistent with the standard mathematical definition of the conversion.

Based on the given information and the assumption that the input will always be valid, the program accurately implements the conversion from degrees to radians as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
