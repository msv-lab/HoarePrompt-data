Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * pi / 180`. The `math.pi` constant is used for precision, and the function takes the angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians.

The function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including positive and negative angles, as well as zero. For example:

- `func_1(90)` should return approximately 1.5708 (which is `math.pi / 2`), and it does.
- `func_1(-90)` should return approximately -1.5708 (which is `-math.pi / 2`), and it does.
- `func_1(0)` should return exactly 0, and it does.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
