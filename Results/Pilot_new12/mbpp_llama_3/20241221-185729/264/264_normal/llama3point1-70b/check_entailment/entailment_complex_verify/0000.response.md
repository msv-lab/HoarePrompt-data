To assess the correctness of the provided Python program that converts degrees to radians, we need to examine both the original assessment and the annotated version of the code, considering the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians. The standard formula for this conversion is `radians = degrees * π / 180`. The original assessment concludes that the program is correct because it accurately implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π, and it correctly handles positive, negative, and zero degree inputs, as well as fractional degree inputs.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by detailing the state of the program before the function call and explaining the calculation performed within the function. It correctly notes that the function takes a real number representing an angle in degrees, performs the conversion, and returns the equivalent angle in radians without modifying the input or having any side effects. The annotation also clarifies that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a real number, which aligns with the assumption that the input will always be valid.

Given this information, the original assessment is accurate because the program does implement the conversion formula correctly and handles all real number inputs as specified. The assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty, real number) is crucial here, as it allows us to disregard potential issues with non-numeric or invalid inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program is correct under the assumption of valid input.

Final: **True**
