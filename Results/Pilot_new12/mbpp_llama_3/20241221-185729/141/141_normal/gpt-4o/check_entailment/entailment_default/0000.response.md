Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. It does this by first converting the integer into a string to easily iterate through each digit. Then, it counts the frequency of each digit using a dictionary and checks if this frequency exceeds the integer value of the digit. If any digit's frequency exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all digits.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality and help to confirm that the code is correct. The hints indicate that the function handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers and numbers with repeated digits, and correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 or when `n` contains multiple occurrences of the same digit. 

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(1234) == True`, `assert func_1(51241) == False`, and `assert func_1(321) == True`, also support the correctness of the function, as they demonstrate the function's behavior for different inputs. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's correctness is confirmed. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the specified condition, and its behavior matches the problem description for all potential cases.
