Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks whether the frequency of each digit in the given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. It correctly handles all potential cases by converting the integer to a string, counting the frequency of each digit using a dictionary, and then checking if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program converts the integer to a string, allowing it to iterate over each digit.
2. It uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each digit, which is an efficient way to store and retrieve the count of each digit.
3. It then checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself by iterating over the dictionary items.
4. If it finds a digit where the frequency is greater than the digit itself, it immediately returns `False`.
5. If it checks all digits and does not find any such case, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(1234) == True`, `assert func_1(51241) == False`, and `assert func_1(321) == True`, demonstrate that the program works as expected for different inputs.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
