Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It takes an integer as input, converts it to a string, calculates the frequency of each digit, and checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program converts the input integer `n` to a string `digit_str`, which allows it to iterate over each digit in the integer.
2. It uses a dictionary `frequency` to store the frequency of each digit in the integer. The keys of the dictionary are the digits themselves, and the values are the frequencies of these digits.
3. The program iterates over each digit in the string representation of the integer, incrementing the frequency count in the dictionary for each occurrence of the digit.
4. After calculating the frequency of each digit, the program checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If it finds a digit whose frequency exceeds its integer value, it immediately returns `False`.
5. If the program completes the check without finding any digits whose frequency exceeds its integer value, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit in the integer does not exceed the integer value of the digit.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(1234) == True` and `assert func_1(51241) == False`, demonstrate that the program behaves as expected for different inputs. The program correctly handles all possible cases, including integers with repeating digits and integers with digits that have a frequency equal to their integer value.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description, and its correctness is confirmed by the provided unit tests and the logic of the program itself.
