Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function first converts the integer into a string to easily iterate over each digit. Then, it uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each digit. Finally, it checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The function handles all potential cases correctly. For example, it correctly returns `True` for the input `1234` because the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself (1 appears once, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, and 4 appears once). It correctly returns `False` for the input `51241` because the frequency of the digit 1 is 2, which is greater than the digit itself. It also correctly returns `True` for the input `321` because the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself (3 appears once, 2 appears once, and 1 appears once).

The function also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input integer is a single digit or when the input integer contains repeated digits. In general, the function works correctly for all possible inputs, and therefore, the correctness is **True**.
