To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over each character `digit` in the string `digit_str`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`.
3. For the loop to execute again, there must be more characters in `digit_str` after the current `digit`.

Given these points, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer, as the loop does not modify `n` directly.
- `digit_str` is still a non-empty string representation of `n`, but now we consider the string starting from the second character (since we've already processed the first character in the previous iteration).
- `digit` will be the second character of the original `digit_str`, which becomes the first character of the remaining string to be processed.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one more character, `digit` is the second character of the original `digit_str`**
