Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`. If `digit` is already a key in `frequency`, then the value of `digit` in `frequency` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `frequency` is updated with `digit` as a key and 1 as its value.***
