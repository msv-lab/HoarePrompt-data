To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.
- `frequency` is an empty dictionary.

The loop statement is `for digit in digit_str:`. This implies that the loop will iterate over each character (digit) in the string `digit_str`.

For the loop to execute:
1. `digit_str` must have at least one character. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `digit_str` is its string representation, the only case where `digit_str` would be empty is if `n` were 0, because the string representation of 0 is '0', which is not empty. Thus, `digit_str` will always have at least one character for any non-negative integer `n`.
2. The loop variable `digit` will take the value of each character in `digit_str` sequentially, starting from the first character.
3. The state of `frequency` being an empty dictionary indicates it is ready to be populated, presumably with the frequency of each digit in `digit_str`, but this does not affect the loop's ability to start executing.

Considering these points, for the loop to execute:
- `n` being a non-negative integer ensures `digit_str` will have a valid string representation.
- `digit_str` must have at least one character, which is guaranteed by `n` being a non-negative integer.
- `frequency` is an empty dictionary, ready for use.
- `digit` will be initialized to the first character of `digit_str` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`**
