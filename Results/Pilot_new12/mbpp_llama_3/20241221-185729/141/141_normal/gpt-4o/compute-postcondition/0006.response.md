The code `frequency[digit] = 1` updates the `frequency` dictionary by adding the `digit` as a key with a value of 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

The `frequency` dictionary, which was initially empty, now contains the `digit` as a key with a value of 1. The `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`, and `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`. 

The value of `n` is still a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is still a non-empty string representation of `n`, and `digit` is still the first character of `digit_str`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with `digit` as a key and 1 as its value, and `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`.**
