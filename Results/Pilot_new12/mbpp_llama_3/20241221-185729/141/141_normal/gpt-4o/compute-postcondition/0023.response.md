Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string of at least one digit, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that digit in `digit_str`, `digit` is the next key in the `frequency` dictionary, `count` is the frequency of the next `digit` in `digit_str`. If the frequency of the next `digit` is greater than the integer value of the next `digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**
