The loop code checks each unique digit in the string representation of `n` and its frequency in `digit_str`. If the frequency of any digit is greater than the integer value of that digit, the function immediately returns False.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that digit in `digit_str`. If for all digits in `digit_str`, the frequency of the digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit, then the loop completes without returning False. Otherwise, the function returns False as soon as it encounters a digit whose frequency exceeds its integer value.**
