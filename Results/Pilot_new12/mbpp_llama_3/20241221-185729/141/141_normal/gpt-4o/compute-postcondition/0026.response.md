Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string of at least one digit, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `digit` is the next key in the `frequency` dictionary, `count` is the frequency of the next `digit` in `digit_str`. If the frequency of the next `digit` in `digit_str` is greater than the digit itself, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made or results are returned.***
