According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digit_str`. If `digit_str` has at least one more character after the current `digit`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the second character of the original `digit_str`, `digit_str` has at least one more character, `n` is a non-negative integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `digit` must be the third character of the original `digit_str` (or the next character if `digit` was not the second character), and `digit_str` must have at least one more character after the current `digit`. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least two characters, `digit` is the third character of the original `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is the original value of `frequency[digit]` plus 1. Otherwise, `frequency[digit]` is 1.**
