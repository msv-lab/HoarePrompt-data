According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `frequency` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least one more key-value pair, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `frequency` has at least one key-value pair, `digit` is a key in the `frequency` dictionary, `count` is the frequency of `digit` in `digit_str`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `frequency` dictionary must have at least one more key-value pair, `digit` is the next key in the `frequency` dictionary, and `count` is the frequency of the next `digit` in `digit_str`. Additionally, the frequency of the next `digit` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the next `digit`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string of at least one digit, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that digit in `digit_str`, `digit` is the next key in the `frequency` dictionary, `count` is the frequency of the next `digit` in `digit_str`, and the frequency of the next `digit` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next `digit`**
