The value of `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one more character, `digit` is the second character of the original `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one more character, `digit` is the second character of the original `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is the original value of `frequency[digit]` plus 1**
