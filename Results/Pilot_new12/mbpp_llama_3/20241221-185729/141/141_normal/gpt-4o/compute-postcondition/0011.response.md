Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one more character, `digit` is the second character of the original `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is the original value of `frequency[digit]` plus 1. Otherwise, `frequency[digit]` is 1.***
