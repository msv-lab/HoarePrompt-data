The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the frequency of each digit in the string representation of `n` does not exceed the integer value of the digit. The function iterates through each digit in the string representation of `n`, counts the frequency of each unique digit, and checks if this frequency is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If any digit's frequency exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all digits. The function handles all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers and numbers with repeated digits, and it correctly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 or when `n` contains multiple occurrences of the same digit. The function's return value provides a clear indication of whether the input number satisfies the specified condition.
