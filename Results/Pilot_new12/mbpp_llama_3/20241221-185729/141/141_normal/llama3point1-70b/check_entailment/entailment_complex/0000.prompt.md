You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`. If `str_n` is not empty, then for every `digit` in `str_n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is either less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`, or the function has returned `False` due to a violation of this condition for at least one `digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of the digit is either less than or equal to the integer value of the digit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. The function iterates through each digit in the string representation of `n`, checking the condition for each digit. If any digit's count exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such cases, it returns `True`. This functionality encompasses all potential edge cases, including single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits that have a count exceeding their integer value. The function handles these cases by either returning `False` as soon as a violation is detected or returning `True` after confirming that all digits satisfy the condition. Note that the input `n` is not modified by the function, and the return value is the sole output, providing a clear indication of whether the input number meets the specified condition.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
