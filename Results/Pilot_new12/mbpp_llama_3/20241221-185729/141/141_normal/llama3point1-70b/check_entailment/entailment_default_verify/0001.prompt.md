You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Conversion to string**: The function converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`. This allows for iteration over each digit in the integer.
2. **Iteration over digits**: The function iterates over each digit in the string `str_n`.
3. **Frequency check**: For each digit, the function uses the `count()` method to get the frequency of that digit in the string `str_n`. It then compares this frequency to the digit itself (after converting it back to an integer using `int(digit)`).
4. **Return value**: If the frequency of any digit is greater than the digit itself, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration over all digits without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly implements the problem description. The function handles all possible cases, including:

* Single-digit integers
* Multi-digit integers
* Integers with repeated digits
* Integers with digits that have a frequency less than or equal to themselves
* Integers with digits that have a frequency greater than themselves

For example, consider the input `n = 112`. The function will iterate over the digits as follows:

* `digit = '1'`: frequency is 2, which is less than or equal to 1 is `False`, so the function returns `False`.
* However, consider the input `n = 121`. The function will iterate over the digits as follows:
* `digit = '1'`: frequency is 2, which is less than or equal to 1 is `False`, so the function returns `False`.
* Consider the input `n = 1`. The function will iterate over the digits as follows:
* `digit = '1'`: frequency is 1, which is less than or equal to 1 is `True`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, the correctness is `True`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. The function iterates through each digit in the string representation of `n`, checking the condition for each digit. If any digit's count exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such cases, it returns `True`. This functionality encompasses all potential edge cases, including single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits that have a count exceeding their integer value. The function handles these cases by either returning `False` as soon as a violation is detected or returning `True` after confirming that all digits satisfy the condition. Note that the input `n` is not modified by the function, and the return value is the sole output, providing a clear indication of whether the input number meets the specified condition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
