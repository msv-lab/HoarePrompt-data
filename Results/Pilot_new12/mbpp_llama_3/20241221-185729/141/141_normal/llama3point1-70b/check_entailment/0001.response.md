Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Conversion to string**: The function converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`. This allows for iteration over each digit in the integer.
2. **Iteration over digits**: The function iterates over each digit in the string `str_n`.
3. **Frequency check**: For each digit, the function uses the `count()` method to get the frequency of that digit in the string `str_n`. It then compares this frequency to the digit itself (after converting it back to an integer using `int(digit)`).
4. **Return value**: If the frequency of any digit is greater than the digit itself, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration over all digits without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly implements the problem description. The function handles all possible cases, including:

* Single-digit integers
* Multi-digit integers
* Integers with repeated digits
* Integers with digits that have a frequency less than or equal to themselves
* Integers with digits that have a frequency greater than themselves

For example, consider the input `n = 112`. The function will iterate over the digits as follows:

* `digit = '1'`: frequency is 2, which is less than or equal to 1 is `False`, so the function returns `False`.
* However, consider the input `n = 121`. The function will iterate over the digits as follows:
* `digit = '1'`: frequency is 2, which is less than or equal to 1 is `False`, so the function returns `False`.
* Consider the input `n = 1`. The function will iterate over the digits as follows:
* `digit = '1'`: frequency is 1, which is less than or equal to 1 is `True`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle, the correctness is `True`.
