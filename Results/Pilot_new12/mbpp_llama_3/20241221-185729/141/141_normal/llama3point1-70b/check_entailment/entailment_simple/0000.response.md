Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a string `str_n`. This allows for easy iteration over each digit in the number.

2. The function then iterates over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the digit. If this condition is met for any digit, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. If the function completes the iteration over all digits without returning `False`, it returns `True`. This indicates that for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of the digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit.

The program covers all potential cases because it checks every digit in the input number. The use of the `str_n.count(digit)` method ensures that the count of each digit is compared to its integer value, which is what the problem description requires.

Since the program handles all possible digits and correctly checks their counts according to the problem description, it is considered correct. 

Example use cases:
- If the input is `111`, the function will return `True` because the count of `1` (3) is greater than the integer value of `1` (1), but in this specific implementation, the function will return `False` as expected.
- If the input is `123`, the function will return `True` because the count of each digit (`1`, `2`, `3`) is 1, which is less than or equal to the integer value of each digit.
- If the input is `222`, the function will return `False` because the count of `2` (3) is greater than the integer value of `2` (2).
