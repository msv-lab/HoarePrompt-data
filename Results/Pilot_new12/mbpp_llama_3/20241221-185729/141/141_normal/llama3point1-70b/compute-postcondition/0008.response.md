To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with at least 2 characters.
- `digit` is the second character in `str_n`.

The loop statement is `for digit in str_n`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `str_n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `digit` was the second character in `str_n`. For the loop to execute again, `digit` needs to move to the next character in `str_n`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` remains the same because the loop does not modify `n` based on the given information.
- `str_n` remains the same for the same reason as `n`.
- `digit` needs to be the third character in `str_n` because it has moved one position forward from the second character.

Also, considering the condition that `str_n` has at least 2 characters and we are moving to the next character, `str_n` must now have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `str_n`**
