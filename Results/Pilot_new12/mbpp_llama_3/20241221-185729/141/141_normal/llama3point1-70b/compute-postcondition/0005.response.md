To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` that must have at least 1 character.
- `digit` is the first character in `str_n`.
- The count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`.

Loop statement: `for digit in str_n:`

For the loop to execute one more time, it means we are moving to the next character in `str_n`. 

1. Since `digit` was the first character in `str_n` during the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `digit` should be the second character in `str_n`.
2. The condition that the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit` must still hold, but now considering the new `digit` which is the second character.
3. `str_n` must have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute one more time because we've already processed the first character.
4. `n` remains the same as it's not directly modified by the loop iteration; it's just the basis for `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`**
