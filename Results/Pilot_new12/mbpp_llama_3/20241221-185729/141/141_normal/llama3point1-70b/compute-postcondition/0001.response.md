According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `str_n`. If `str_n` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `str_n` is equal to the string representation of `n`, for `str_n` to be not empty, `n` must be greater than 0 or `str_n` must be '0' because the string representation of 0 is '0'. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer and `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n`, so for the loop to execute, `str_n` must have at least 1 character and `digit` is the first character in `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `str_n`**
