Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. The function iterates through each digit in the string representation of `n`, checking the condition for each digit. If any digit's count exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such cases, it returns `True`. This functionality encompasses all potential edge cases, including single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits that have a count exceeding their integer value. The function handles these cases by either returning `False` as soon as a violation is detected or returning `True` after confirming that all digits satisfy the condition. Note that the input `n` is not modified by the function, and the return value is the sole output, providing a clear indication of whether the input number meets the specified condition.**
