Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
