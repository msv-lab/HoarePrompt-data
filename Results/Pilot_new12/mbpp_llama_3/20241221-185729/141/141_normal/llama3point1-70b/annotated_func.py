#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`. If `str_n` is not empty, then for every `digit` in `str_n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is either less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`, or the function has returned `False` due to a violation of this condition for at least one `digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of the digit is either less than or equal to the integer value of the digit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to the integer value of that digit. The function iterates through each digit in the string representation of `n`, checking the condition for each digit. If any digit's count exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such cases, it returns `True`. This functionality encompasses all potential edge cases, including single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits that have a count exceeding their integer value. The function handles these cases by either returning `False` as soon as a violation is detected or returning `True` after confirming that all digits satisfy the condition. Note that the input `n` is not modified by the function, and the return value is the sole output, providing a clear indication of whether the input number meets the specified condition.
