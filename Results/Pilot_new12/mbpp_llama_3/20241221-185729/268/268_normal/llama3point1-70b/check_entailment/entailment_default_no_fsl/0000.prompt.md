You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
Program:
```
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))


```
Output hints: The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the elements at index `n-1` in each row if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, it returns the maximum of the elements at the last index of each row. The function handles cases where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])) and assumes that the input matrix is not empty and all rows have the same number of elements. The function does not modify the input matrix and only returns a single maximum value. If the matrix is empty or rows have different lengths, the function's behavior is undefined. The function's return value is determined by the maximum value found in the specified column or the last column if `n` is 0.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
