You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value of the elements at index n-1 in each row of the matrix, where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) and the matrix is a 2D list of integers. If n is 0, it returns the maximum of the last elements of each row.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value of the elements at index `n-1` in each row if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, it returns the maximum of the elements at the last index of each row. The function handles cases where `n` is within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])) and assumes that the input matrix is not empty and all rows have the same number of elements. The function does not modify the input matrix and only returns a single maximum value. If the matrix is empty or rows have different lengths, the function's behavior is undefined. The function's return value is determined by the maximum value found in the specified column or the last column if `n` is 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
