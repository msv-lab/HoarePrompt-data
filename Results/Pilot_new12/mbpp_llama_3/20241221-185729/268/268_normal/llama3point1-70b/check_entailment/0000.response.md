Correctness: **True**.

This program correctly implements the function to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a matrix. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over each row in the matrix and extract the n'th element (where n is 1-indexed). It then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value among these elements.

The code handles all potential cases, including:

- An empty matrix: In this case, the `max` function will raise a `ValueError` because it is trying to find the maximum of an empty sequence.
- A matrix with fewer than n columns: In this case, an `IndexError` will be raised when trying to access the n'th element of a row.
- A matrix with non-numeric values: In this case, the `max` function will raise a `TypeError` if it tries to compare non-numeric values.

However, these potential edge cases are not explicitly handled by the program, which might be a consideration for robustness. But based on the given problem description, the program does what it's supposed to do. It finds the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix. 

Therefore, the code is correct according to the given problem description.
