Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks to return the maximum value of the n'th column in the matrix, but the program returns the maximum value of the elements at index `n-1` in each row. This means that if `n` is 1, the function should return the maximum of the first column, but the program returns the maximum of the elements at index 0, which is correct. However, if `n` is greater than 1, the program does not return the maximum of the n'th column as expected, because it subtracts 1 from `n`.

For example, if the matrix is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` and `n` is 1, the program returns the maximum of the first column, which is 7. But if `n` is 2, the program returns the maximum of the elements at index 1, which is the second column, but the program uses `n-1` as the index, so it returns the maximum of the first column, which is incorrect.

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This function returns the maximum value of the elements at index `n` in each row, which corresponds to the n'th column in the matrix.
