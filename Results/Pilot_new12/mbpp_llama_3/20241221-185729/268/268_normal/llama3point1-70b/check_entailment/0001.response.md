Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` as input, and it returns the maximum value in the `n`th column of the matrix.

The program uses a generator expression to extract the `n`th element from each row in the matrix, and then it uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value among these elements. The use of `n - 1` as the index is correct because Python lists are 0-indexed, meaning that the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. It handles the general case where the matrix is a list of lists and `n` is a valid column index. The program assumes that all rows in the matrix have at least `n` elements, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem description. If a row has fewer than `n` elements, the program will raise an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior for an invalid input. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles the general case, so I conclude that it is correct.
