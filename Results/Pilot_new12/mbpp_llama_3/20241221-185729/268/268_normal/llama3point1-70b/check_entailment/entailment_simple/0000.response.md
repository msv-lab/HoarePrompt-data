The provided Python program does not meet the problem description. 

To understand why, let's analyze the problem description and the given code:

Problem Description: The function should return the max of the n'th column in a given matrix.

Given Code:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
```
The code attempts to find the maximum value in the (n-1)th column of the matrix. However, this approach is incorrect because the problem description asks for the max of the n'th column, not the (n-1)th column.

For example, if the input matrix is:
```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```
And `n` is 2, the function should return the maximum value of the 2nd column, which is `[2, 5, 8]`. The maximum value in this column is 8.

However, the given code would return the maximum value of the 1st column (since `n-1` is 1), which is `[1, 4, 7]`. The maximum value in this column is 7.

To correctly implement the function, the code should be modified to:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```
Or more robustly:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix) if n < len(matrix[0]) else None
```
But since we assume the input is always valid, the first version is enough.

Correctness: **False**
