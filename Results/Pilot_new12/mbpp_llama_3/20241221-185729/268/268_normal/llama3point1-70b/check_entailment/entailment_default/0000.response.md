Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly implement the function to return the maximum value of the n'th column in a given matrix. The function uses a generator expression to find the maximum value in the specified column. 

The code correctly handles cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 <= n <= len(matrix[0])) and assumes that the input matrix is not empty and all rows have the same number of elements, as stated in the problem description.

The code snippet also correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, as the output hints mention that if `n` is 0, it returns the maximum of the elements at the last index of each row.

In the given code, there are no signs of infinite loops, and it should run correctly for the given problem description. Also, as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, so edge cases such as an empty list, or lists of different lengths are not considered.

So overall, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case and there are no inconsistencies with the output hints provided.
