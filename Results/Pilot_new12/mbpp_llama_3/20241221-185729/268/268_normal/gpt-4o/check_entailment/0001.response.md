Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and the column index `n` as input, and returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix.

The program uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the matrix, and then returns the maximum value in this column using the built-in `max` function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs. Additionally, the function handles the general case where the matrix can have any number of rows and columns.

There are no visible edge cases that the program does not handle. For example, it correctly handles:

* Empty matrix (not tested explicitly, but the function would raise an `IndexError` in this case, which might be the expected behavior)
* Matrix with a single row or column
* Matrix with non-integer values (not tested explicitly, but the `max` function works with any comparable values)

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
