Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the task described in the problem. It uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the input matrix and then returns the maximum value from that column using the built-in `max` function.

Here's a breakdown of why this code should work for every potential case:

1. **Column Extraction**: The list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` correctly extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix. This is because `row[n]` accesses the `n`-th element of each row (with indexing starting at 0), and this is done for each row in the matrix.

2. **Max Value Calculation**: Once the `n`-th column is extracted into the `nth_column` list, the `max(nth_column)` function correctly finds and returns the maximum value within this list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **Matrix with One Row**: The function should work correctly even if the matrix has only one row, as the list comprehension can handle lists with any number of elements.
   - **Matrix with One Column**: If `n` is 0 (assuming the first column), the function should still work correctly.
   - **Empty Matrix**: This is a potential edge case that could cause issues. If the input matrix is empty (`[]`), attempting to access `row[n]` would result in an error because there are no rows to iterate over. However, based on the provided unit tests, it seems the assumption is that the input matrix will not be empty.
   - **Column Index Out of Range**: If `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in any row, this would result in an `IndexError`. The function does not include any error checking to handle this scenario.

Given the lack of explicit error handling for edge cases like an empty matrix or a column index out of range, and considering that none of the provided assertions test these conditions, one might argue that the function is somewhat naive and could be considered incomplete or incorrect in a robustness context. However, strictly based on the functionality as described and the provided unit tests, the function appears to work as intended within the constraints of those tests.

Therefore, based on the description and examples provided, and without a specific counterexample that demonstrates the function failing to meet its described purpose within those constraints, the conclusion is that the program is correct for the defined use cases.
