Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem statement asks to write a function that, given a matrix represented as a list of lists, returns the maximum value of the n'th column. 

Here is why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `matrix` (a 2D list of elements) and `n` (a non-negative integer).
2. The function uses list comprehension to extract the n'th column from the matrix: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`.
3. It then returns the maximum value from the n'th column using the built-in `max` function: `return max(nth_column)`.
4. Since we assume the input will be valid (i.e., `matrix` is not empty and `n` is within the valid range of column indices), the function will not encounter any edge cases that would cause it to behave incorrectly.

Overall, the function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix, as specified in the problem description.
