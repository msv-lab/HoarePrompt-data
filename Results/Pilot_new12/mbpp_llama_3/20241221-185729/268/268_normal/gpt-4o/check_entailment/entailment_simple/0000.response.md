Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct according to the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the `matrix`.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The program uses a list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the `matrix`. This is done with the line `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`, which creates a new list containing only the `n`-th element of each row.

2. The program then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the `nth_column` list.

3. The maximum value found is then returned by the function.

Since the problem description asks to return the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the `matrix`, and the program does exactly that, it is correct.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the program by verifying that it returns the expected results for different inputs.

Note that the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, meaning that `n` will always be a non-negative integer less than the number of columns in the `matrix`, and that the `matrix` will always be a non-empty list of lists. Under these assumptions, the program is correct and will always produce the expected results.
