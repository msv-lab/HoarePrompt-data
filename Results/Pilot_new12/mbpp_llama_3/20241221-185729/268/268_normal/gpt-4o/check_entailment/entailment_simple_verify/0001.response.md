Based on the provided problem description, original assessment, and annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and the column index `n` as input, and returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs. The function handles the general case where the matrix can have any number of rows and columns.

The annotated version of the code also supports the correctness of the program. The state of the program right before the function call is a 2D list of elements, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description. The function then extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix using a list comprehension and returns the maximum value in this column using the `max` function.

The annotated version provides a clear description of the program's state at different points, and it aligns with the problem description. The program returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the 2D list `matrix`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and I maintain it.

Final: **True**
