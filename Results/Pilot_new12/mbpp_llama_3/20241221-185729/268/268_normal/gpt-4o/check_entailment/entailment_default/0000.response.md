Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It takes a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value from the nth column of `matrix`. The code does this by first creating a list `nth_column` containing all the elements in the nth column of `matrix`, and then returning the maximum value from this list.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code. The function `func_1` handles the cases where the input `matrix` is a list of lists and `n` is a valid column index. 

It's also worth noting that the problem description does not specify what to do with invalid inputs such as an empty list or an index that's out of range. The output hints do mention that the function will not handle these edge cases explicitly and may raise an exception, which is correct. However, the assumption is that the input will be valid, which means the function's correctness is not affected by these edge cases.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and works as expected for all valid inputs.
