Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (a 2D list) and a non-negative integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the matrix.

The list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` effectively extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix, and the built-in `max` function returns the maximum value from this column.

The output hints suggest that the function may raise an exception if the input matrix is empty or if `n` is out of range. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code, as they demonstrate that the function returns the expected maximum values for different input matrices and column indices.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the code is correct and meets the requirements for every potential case, assuming valid input.
