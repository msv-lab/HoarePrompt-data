Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, where `n` is less than the number of columns in `matrix`, and returns the maximum value from the nth column of `matrix`. If the input `matrix` is empty or if `n` is out of range (i.e., `n` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of columns in `matrix`), the function will not handle these edge cases explicitly and may raise an exception. After the function executes, the original input `matrix` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single value representing the maximum element in the specified column.**
