To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and the given code snippet. The initial state provides us with a 2D list named `matrix`, a non-negative integer `n` that is less than the length of the first row in `matrix` (assuming all rows have the same length), and `nth_column` which is a list constructed by taking the `n`th element from each row in `matrix`.

Given `nth_column` is defined as `[row[n] for row in matrix]`, this means `nth_column` contains all the elements from the `n`th column of `matrix`.

The code snippet `return max(nth_column)` aims to find the maximum value within `nth_column`.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, and assuming `matrix` is not empty and all its rows have the same number of elements, `nth_column` will always contain elements.

The `max()` function returns the largest item in an iterable (in this case, `nth_column`), which means it will return the maximum value found in the `n`th column of `matrix`.

Therefore, the output state will be the maximum value from the `n`th column of `matrix`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the nth column of the 2D list `matrix`.**
