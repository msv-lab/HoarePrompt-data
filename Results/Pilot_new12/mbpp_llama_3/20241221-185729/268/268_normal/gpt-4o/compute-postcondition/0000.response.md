The code snippet is iterating over each row in the `matrix` and extracting the element at index `n`. This results in a new list `nth_column` containing the elements from the `n`-th column of the `matrix`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a 2D list of elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` < len(`matrix`[0]), `nth_column` is a list of elements equal to `[row[`n`] for row in `matrix`]`.**
