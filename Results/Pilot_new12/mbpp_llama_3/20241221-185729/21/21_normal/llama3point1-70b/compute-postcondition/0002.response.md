Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. It does not modify the input list `nums`. If the list contains duplicate smallest numbers, it will return one of them. The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, as it will raise a ValueError when attempting to find the minimum value of an empty sequence. The function assumes that the input list contains only comparable elements (e.g., numbers), and its behavior is undefined if the list contains non-comparable elements (e.g., strings and numbers).**
