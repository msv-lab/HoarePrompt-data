Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(nums)` uses the built-in Python function `min()` to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to handle all potential cases, including:

- An empty list: In this case, the `min()` function would raise a `ValueError`, which could be considered as expected behavior since there is no smallest number in an empty list. However, it would be better to add a check to handle this case and return a specific value or message.
- A list with duplicate smallest numbers: The `min()` function will return the smallest number, which meets the problem description.
- A list with negative numbers or zero: The `min()` function will correctly identify the smallest number, including negative numbers or zero.
- A list with floating-point numbers: The `min()` function will also work correctly with floating-point numbers.

To make the function more robust, it could be modified to handle edge cases like an empty list, but in terms of finding the smallest number in a non-empty list, the function is correct. 

Here is an example of how to handle the edge case of an empty list:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None  # or any other value to indicate the list is empty
    return min(nums)
```
