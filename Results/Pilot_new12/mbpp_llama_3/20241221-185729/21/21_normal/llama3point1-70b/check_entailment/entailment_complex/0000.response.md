Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function. 

As stated in the annotations, the function does not modify the input list `nums`. It also does not handle the case where the input list is empty, but since we assume the input will be valid, this is not a concern. Additionally, the function assumes that the input list contains only comparable elements (e.g., numbers), which aligns with the problem description.

The function will return one of the smallest numbers if there are duplicate smallest numbers in the list, which is also in line with the problem description. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct.
