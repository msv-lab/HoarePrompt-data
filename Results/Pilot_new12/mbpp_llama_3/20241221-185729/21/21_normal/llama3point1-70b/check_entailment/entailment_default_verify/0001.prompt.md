You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to handle all possible cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate minimum values, and lists with negative numbers.

Here are some example use cases that demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- Finding the smallest number in a list of positive integers: `func_1([5, 2, 8, 1])` returns `1`.
- Finding the smallest number in a list of negative integers: `func_1([-5, -2, -8, -1])` returns `-8`.
- Finding the smallest number in a list with duplicate minimum values: `func_1([5, 2, 2, 8, 1])` returns `1`.

However, it's worth noting that this function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, because the `min` function does not support empty sequences. To handle this edge case, you could modify the function to return a specific value (e.g., `None`) or raise a custom error when the input list is empty.

For example:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None  # or raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    return min(nums)
```
Overall, the original function is correct for all non-empty lists, but may not handle the edge case of an empty input list as desired.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. It does not modify the input list `nums`. If the list contains duplicate smallest numbers, it will return one of them. The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, as it will raise a ValueError when attempting to find the minimum value of an empty sequence. The function assumes that the input list contains only comparable elements (e.g., numbers), and its behavior is undefined if the list contains non-comparable elements (e.g., strings and numbers).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
