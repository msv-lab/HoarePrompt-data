Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to handle all possible cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate minimum values, and lists with negative numbers.

Here are some example use cases that demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- Finding the smallest number in a list of positive integers: `func_1([5, 2, 8, 1])` returns `1`.
- Finding the smallest number in a list of negative integers: `func_1([-5, -2, -8, -1])` returns `-8`.
- Finding the smallest number in a list with duplicate minimum values: `func_1([5, 2, 2, 8, 1])` returns `1`.

However, it's worth noting that this function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty, because the `min` function does not support empty sequences. To handle this edge case, you could modify the function to return a specific value (e.g., `None`) or raise a custom error when the input list is empty.

For example:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None  # or raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    return min(nums)
```
Overall, the original function is correct for all non-empty lists, but may not handle the edge case of an empty input list as desired.
