Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The function takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
2. It uses the built-in Python function `min()` to find the smallest number in the list.
3. The function returns this smallest number.

Since the problem description asks to find the smallest number in a list and the function does exactly that using the `min()` function, it meets the requirements. Additionally, the problem description assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers), which means we don't need to consider edge cases like an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values. 

Therefore, the function is correct and always does what the problem description says.
