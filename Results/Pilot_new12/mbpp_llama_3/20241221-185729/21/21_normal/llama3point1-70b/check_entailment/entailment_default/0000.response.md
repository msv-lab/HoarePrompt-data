Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code seems to be mostly correct, but it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the output hints, if the list is empty, it will raise a ValueError when attempting to find the minimum value of an empty sequence. This means that the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, specifically when the input list is empty. However, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. But the code itself when run with an empty list will indeed throw an error. This could be a problem if we are not guaranteed that the input list will always be non-empty. For example, if the input list is `[]`, the function will raise a ValueError. Therefore, the correctness is **False**. 

However it is worth noting that the function `min()` itself will throw an error if the list is empty. If we assume the input to the function will always be a valid non-empty list, the function will indeed provide the correct output as it simply returns the smallest number in the list using python's built-in `min()` function. The function does not modify the input list `nums` and it will return one of the smallest numbers if there are duplicates. It will only work with comparable elements such as numbers, but that should not be considered an error in this context since we assume the input will always be valid.
