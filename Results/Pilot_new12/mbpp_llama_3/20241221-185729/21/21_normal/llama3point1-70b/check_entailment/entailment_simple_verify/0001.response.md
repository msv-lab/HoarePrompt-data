To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, we need to consider several factors.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided function, `func_1`, uses the built-in `min` function to achieve this. The original assessment finds the function correct for all non-empty lists but notes an issue with handling empty lists, which could raise a `ValueError`.

The annotated version of the code clarifies two important points:
1. The state of the program right before the function call is such that `nums` is a non-empty list of numbers.
2. After the function execution, the program returns the smallest number in the list `nums`.

Given these annotations and the assumption that the input to the program will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers), the function is indeed designed to correctly find the smallest number in such a list. The annotations align with the problem description and essentially preclude the error case of an empty list, which was the main critique in the original assessment.

Since we're operating under the condition that the input will always be valid and that the function is intended for use with non-empty lists of numbers, the original assessment's primary concern about handling empty lists is mitigated by the problem's constraints.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the assumption of valid input, the program as presented does correctly solve the problem as described. The annotations provide a context in which the program's behavior is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

**Final: True**
