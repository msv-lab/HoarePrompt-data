#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the smallest integer in the list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers and returns the smallest integer in the list. If the list contains duplicate minimum values, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the input list. It raises a ValueError if an empty list is provided, although this edge case is not explicitly handled in the given code, it's implicit in the Python built-in min() function. The function assumes that the input list only contains integers, and its behavior with other types of elements is not defined, but it will likely throw an error or return incorrect results if the list contains non-comparable elements.
