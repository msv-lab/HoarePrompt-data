Correctness: **True** 

The provided Python program meets the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest integer in the list. The function uses the built-in `min()` function to achieve this.

The problem description asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list. The given program does exactly that. The `min()` function is designed to return the smallest item in an iterable (in this case, a list of integers), which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description.

The program's correctness is further validated by the provided assertions (`assert` statements), which test the function with various inputs and ensure that it returns the expected smallest number in each case.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers), the program behaves as expected and does not need explicit error handling for edge cases like empty lists or non-integer elements, as these are not part of the assumed input domain. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the program is correct.
