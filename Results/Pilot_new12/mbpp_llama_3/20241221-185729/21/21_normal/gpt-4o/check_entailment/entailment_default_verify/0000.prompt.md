You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list, which is a straightforward and efficient approach. The `min` function works by comparing all the elements in the list and returning the smallest one.

I have analyzed the code and considered various potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: The `min` function will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which could be considered a correct behavior as there is no smallest number in an empty list. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle this case, so it's worth noting that the function may need to be modified to handle empty lists explicitly.
* Lists with a single element: The function will correctly return the only element in the list.
* Lists with duplicate smallest elements: The function will correctly return one of the smallest elements in the list.
* Lists with negative numbers or zero: The function will correctly return the smallest number in the list, including negative numbers and zero.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct. However, it's worth noting that the function could be improved to handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with non-numeric elements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of integers and returns the smallest integer in the list. If the list contains duplicate minimum values, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the input list. It raises a ValueError if an empty list is provided, although this edge case is not explicitly handled in the given code, it's implicit in the Python built-in min() function. The function assumes that the input list only contains integers, and its behavior with other types of elements is not defined, but it will likely throw an error or return incorrect results if the list contains non-comparable elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
