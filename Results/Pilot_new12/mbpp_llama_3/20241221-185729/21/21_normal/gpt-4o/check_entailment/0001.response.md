Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and effective. The `min` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

Given the problem description, which asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, the provided `func_1` function does exactly that. The `assert` statements provided test this function with various lists, and in each case, the function correctly identifies the smallest number. 

There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs that the function would not handle correctly. For example, the function would work correctly with:

- A list containing negative numbers
- A list containing floating-point numbers
- A list with duplicate smallest numbers (in which case it would return one of them)
- A list with a single element (in which case it would return that element)

One potential edge case to consider is an empty list. In Python, attempting to find the minimum of an empty sequence with `min()` will raise a `ValueError`. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in the case of an empty list, so while this could be considered a limitation, it does not necessarily make the function incorrect according to the provided description.

Overall, based on the provided problem description and the function's behavior, the code appears to meet the requirements for every potential case that is reasonably covered by the description.
