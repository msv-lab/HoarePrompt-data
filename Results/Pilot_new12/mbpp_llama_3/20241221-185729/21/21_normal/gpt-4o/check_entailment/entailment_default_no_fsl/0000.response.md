Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. The problem description asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list, and the provided function does exactly that. The function assumes that the input is a non-empty list of integers, which is a valid assumption given the problem description and the provided unit tests.

The function works correctly for all the provided examples, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality. The hints mention that the function raises a `ValueError` if an empty list is provided, which is indeed the case for the built-in `min` function in Python. However, since we assume that the input will be valid, this edge case does not affect the correctness of the function.

In general, the function will work correctly for any non-empty list of comparable elements, not just integers. However, since the problem description specifically asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list, we can assume that the input will only contain numbers. Therefore, the function's behavior with other types of elements is not relevant to the problem at hand.

Overall, the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for all valid inputs.
