Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a Python function named `func_1` that uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. The output hints agree with the code, stating that it returns the smallest integer in the list, does not modify the input list, and raises a ValueType (which in Python's case would be a ValueError) if an empty list is provided, although the latter is implicit in how Python's `min()` function works.

Given that the problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list and considering the provided assertions and output hints, the code seems to fulfill the requirements for all potential cases where the input is a non-empty list of integers. It correctly identifies and returns the smallest integer value in the list.

The `min()` function in Python is designed to handle lists of integers (and other comparable types) and will return the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. It implicitly assumes the input list is non-empty and contains comparable elements, aligning with the assumptions of valid input as specified in the guidelines.

The Output hints also specify that if the list contains duplicate minimum values, it returns one of them. This behavior aligns with how the `min()` function works in Python, making the code correct according to the given problem description and output hints. Therefore, based on the provided information and the assumptions regarding valid input, the code appears to correctly implement the required functionality for finding the smallest number in a list of integers.
