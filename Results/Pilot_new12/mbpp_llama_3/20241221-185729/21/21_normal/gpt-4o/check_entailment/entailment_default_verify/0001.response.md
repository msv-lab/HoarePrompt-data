The original assessment is that the program is correct (Correctness: **True**). Based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, I agree with this assessment. The code defines a function `func_1` that uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The output hints further support the correctness by specifying that the function accepts a non-empty list of integers, returns the smallest integer, does not modify the input list, and implies that it would raise an error for an empty list, which are all consistent behaviors for the described function.

The key points that support the correctness include:
- The function directly implements the required functionality using Python's built-in `min` function.
- The provided `assert` statements demonstrate the function behaving as expected for various inputs, including lists with positive integers, and there's no indication that it would fail for other types of integers (e.g., negative numbers, zero) assuming the input list is always valid as stated.
- The output hints clarify the function's behavior for edge cases such as empty lists (which would raise a `ValueError`) and lists containing duplicate minimum values (from which it returns one of them), aligning with how `min` function works in Python.

The original assessment is accurate because it recognizes that the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description without introducing unnecessary complexity or handling of unspecified edge cases beyond what's implicitly covered by Python's `min` function and the problem statement.

Therefore, given the information and the strict assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers), I conclude that the program is correct as per the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
