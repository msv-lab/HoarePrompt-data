Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst` as input and returns the smallest integer in the list using the built-in `min` function.

The function will always return the smallest number in the list because the `min` function is designed to find the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. Since the problem description assumes that the input will be a non-empty list of integers, the `min` function will always be able to find and return the smallest integer in the list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm the correctness of the function. They test the function with different lists of integers and verify that it returns the expected smallest number in each case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct and will always return the smallest number in the input list.
