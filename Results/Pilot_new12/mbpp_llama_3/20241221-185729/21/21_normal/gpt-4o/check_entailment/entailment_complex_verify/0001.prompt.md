You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and effective. The `min` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

Given the problem description, which asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list, the provided `func_1` function does exactly that. The `assert` statements provided test this function with various lists, and in each case, the function correctly identifies the smallest number. 

There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs that the function would not handle correctly. For example, the function would work correctly with:

- A list containing negative numbers
- A list containing floating-point numbers
- A list with duplicate smallest numbers (in which case it would return one of them)
- A list with a single element (in which case it would return that element)

One potential edge case to consider is an empty list. In Python, attempting to find the minimum of an empty sequence with `min()` will raise a `ValueError`. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in the case of an empty list, so while this could be considered a limitation, it does not necessarily make the function incorrect according to the provided description.

Overall, based on the provided problem description and the function's behavior, the code appears to meet the requirements for every potential case that is reasonably covered by the description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the smallest integer in the list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers and returns the smallest integer in the list. If the list contains duplicate minimum values, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the input list. It raises a ValueError if an empty list is provided, although this edge case is not explicitly handled in the given code, it's implicit in the Python built-in min() function. The function assumes that the input list only contains integers, and its behavior with other types of elements is not defined, but it will likely throw an error or return incorrect results if the list contains non-comparable elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
