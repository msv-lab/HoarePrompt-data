The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of lists. Each sublist in the returned list contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner.**
