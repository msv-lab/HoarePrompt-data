Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument. 

The output hints agree with the code and highlight its ability to handle various edge cases, such as empty sublists, empty lists, and duplicate strings. The function preserves the original list and sublists, returning a new sorted version without modifying the input, which meets the problem description.

As we assume the input will be valid, the code does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list of lists or contains non-string elements. Therefore, the provided code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential valid case.
