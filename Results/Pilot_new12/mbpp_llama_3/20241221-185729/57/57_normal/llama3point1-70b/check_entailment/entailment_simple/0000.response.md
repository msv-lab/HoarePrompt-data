Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input, sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument, and returns the sorted list of lists.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Sorting each sublist**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function, which sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner due to the `key=str.lower` argument.
2. **Case-insensitive sorting**: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. This means that strings will be sorted based on their lowercase equivalents, so "Apple" and "apple" will be treated as equal.
3. **Returning the sorted list of lists**: The program returns the sorted list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input list of lists, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner.

The program will work correctly for all valid inputs, assuming that each sublist contains only strings. Since we assume that the input will always be valid, the program does not need to handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., empty lists, non-string elements, etc.). Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
