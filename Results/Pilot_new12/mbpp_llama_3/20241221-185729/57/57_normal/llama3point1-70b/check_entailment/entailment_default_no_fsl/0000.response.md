Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that accepts a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner. This matches the problem description's requirement to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and sorts the sublist using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The function also returns a new list of lists, preserving the original input and its sublists.

The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles various cases, including:

* Empty sublists and empty lists as input
* Duplicate strings in a case-insensitive manner
* Preserving the original list and sublists
* Performing case-insensitive sorting for all sublists

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is `None` or contains non-list or non-string elements. Therefore, the provided code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
