Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, with the `key=str.lower` argument to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive.

This function should work correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Empty sublists
* Sublists containing only one string
* Sublists containing multiple strings with the same case
* Sublists containing multiple strings with different cases
* Sublists containing strings with non-alphabetic characters

The use of `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, so "Abc" and "abc" will be treated as equal for sorting purposes.

For example, if the input is `[["Hello", "hello", "abc"], ["xyz", "Xyz", "ABC"]]`, the output will be `[["abc", "hello", "Hello"], ["ABC", "xyz", "Xyz"]]`, which is the expected result.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
