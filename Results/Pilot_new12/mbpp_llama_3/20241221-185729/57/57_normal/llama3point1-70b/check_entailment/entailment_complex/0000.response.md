Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner, preserving the original list and sublists. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Sorting of sublists**: The list comprehension `[sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]` sorts each sublist of strings in the input list `list_of_lists`. The `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

2. **Preservation of original list and sublists**: The function returns a new list of lists, leaving the original list and sublists unchanged.

3. **Handling of empty sublists and empty lists**: The function handles empty sublists and empty lists correctly by returning a list of empty sublists or an empty list, respectively, which is the expected sorted form.

4. **Handling of duplicate strings**: The function correctly handles duplicate strings in a case-insensitive manner, preserving the original count and mix of strings.

5. **Consistent sorting across the entire output**: The function ensures consistent and case-insensitive sorting across the entire output by applying the same sorting logic to all sublists within the input list.

Overall, the program correctly implements the sorting of sublists of strings in a case-insensitive manner, meeting all the requirements specified in the problem description.
