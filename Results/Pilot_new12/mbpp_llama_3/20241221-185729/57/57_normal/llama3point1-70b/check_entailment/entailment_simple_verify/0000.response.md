To evaluate the correctness of the given Python function `func_1`, we must consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code. The problem asks for a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The original assessment concludes that the function is correct, citing its ability to handle various cases, including empty sublists, sublists with a single string, and sublists with strings of the same or different cases, thanks to the use of `key=str.lower` for case-insensitive sorting.

The annotated version of the code indicates that the function receives a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings, and returns a list of lists with the same strings but sorted in a case-insensitive manner. This annotation aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Upon reviewing the original assessment and the annotated code, it is evident that the original assessment is accurate. The function indeed sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, which matches the problem description. The use of a list comprehension with `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` effectively ensures that all sublists are sorted, regardless of the initial case of the strings. This approach is both efficient and Pythonic, making it suitable for the described task.

Given the alignment between the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated code, there is no evidence to suggest that the function does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of the function's correctness as **True** is maintained.

Final: **True**
