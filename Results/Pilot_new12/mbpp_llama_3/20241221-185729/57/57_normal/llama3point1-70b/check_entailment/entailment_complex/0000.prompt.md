You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The function preserves the original list and sublists, returning a new sorted version without modifying the input. It handles empty sublists and empty lists as input, returning an empty list or a list of empty sublists respectively, both in sorted form which remains unchanged. The function also correctly handles duplicate strings in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the sorted output reflects the original count and mix of strings, regardless of their case. Additionally, the function performs this operation for all sublists within the input list, ensuring a consistent and case-insensitive sorting across the entire output. If the input list is `None` or contains non-list or non-string elements, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results, highlighting the importance of providing a list of lists containing only strings for proper functionality.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
