You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it properly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, ignoring case sensitivity. The `sorted` function is used with the `key=str.lower` argument to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive. This means that both uppercase and lowercase letters are treated equally during the sorting process.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The list comprehension iterates over each sublist in the input list of lists.
2. The `sorted` function sorts each sublist in ascending order, using the `key=str.lower` argument to convert each string to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.
3. The sorted sublists are then returned as a new list of lists.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles empty sublists, single-element sublists, and sublists with duplicate elements correctly. It also handles sublists containing strings with varying cases correctly, due to the use of the `key=str.lower` argument.

Example use cases:

* `func_1([["b", "a", "B"], ["Z", "y", "X"]])` returns `[["a", "B", "b"], ["X", "y", "Z"]]`
* `func_1([["hello", "HELLO", "world"], ["Python", "java", "c++"]])` returns `[["hello", "HELLO", "world"], ["c++", "java", "Python"]]`
* `func_1([[]])` returns `[[]]`
* `func_1([["a"]])` returns `[["a"]]`
* `func_1([["A", "a", "B", "b"]])` returns `[["A", "a", "B", "b"]]`

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
