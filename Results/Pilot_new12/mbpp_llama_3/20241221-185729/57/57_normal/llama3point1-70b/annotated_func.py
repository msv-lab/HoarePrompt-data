#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The function preserves the original list and sublists, returning a new sorted version without modifying the input. It handles empty sublists and empty lists as input, returning an empty list or a list of empty sublists respectively, both in sorted form which remains unchanged. The function also correctly handles duplicate strings in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the sorted output reflects the original count and mix of strings, regardless of their case. Additionally, the function performs this operation for all sublists within the input list, ensuring a consistent and case-insensitive sorting across the entire output. If the input list is `None` or contains non-list or non-string elements, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results, highlighting the importance of providing a list of lists containing only strings for proper functionality.
