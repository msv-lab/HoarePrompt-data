Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist, which sorts the strings in alphabetical order. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior, such as handling empty lists and not modifying the original input.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty input list: The function returns an empty list.
* Empty sublists: The function returns empty lists.
* Sublists with multiple strings: The function sorts the strings in alphabetical order.
* Sublists with single string: The function returns the sublist unchanged.

The examples provided in the problem description demonstrate the function's correctness, and the output hints provide additional confidence that the function behaves as expected.

Note that the problem description assumes that the input will be valid, meaning it will be a list of lists containing only strings. The code does not perform any error checking, but this is not a concern since the input is assumed to be valid.
