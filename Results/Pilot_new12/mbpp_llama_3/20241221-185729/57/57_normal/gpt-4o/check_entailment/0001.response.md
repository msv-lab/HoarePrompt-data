Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and sorts it using the built-in `sorted` function.

The program appears to work correctly for the provided test cases, sorting each sublist in ascending order. The use of the `sorted` function ensures that the sorting is case-sensitive, which might be the intended behavior.

Upon examining the code, it seems to cover all potential cases. The list comprehension handles sublists of any length, and the `sorted` function can handle strings with varying lengths and contents.

One potential edge case is when a sublist contains identical strings. However, the `sorted` function is stable, meaning that equal elements will maintain their original order, which aligns with the problem description.

Another potential edge case is when the input list of lists is empty. In this case, the function will correctly return an empty list, as there are no sublists to sort.

Given that the program handles the provided test cases and potential edge cases, and there are no apparent logic errors or missing cases, it appears to be correct.
