Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided function, `func_1`, uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist in the input list of lists.

Here's why it works:

*   The function takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains strings.
*   It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list.
*   For each sublist, the `sorted` function is used to sort the strings in alphabetical order.
*   The sorted sublists are then collected into a new list, which is returned as the result.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works as expected. They cover different cases, such as sorting lists with different lengths and contents, and the function produces the correct output for each test case.

The program assumes that the input is valid, meaning it's a list of lists containing strings, which is in line with the problem description and the assumption stated in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
