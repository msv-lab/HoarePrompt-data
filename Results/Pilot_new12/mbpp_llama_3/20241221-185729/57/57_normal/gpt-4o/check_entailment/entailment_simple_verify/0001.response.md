To determine the correctness of the program, we analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists and sorts it using the built-in `sorted` function. The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, reasoning that it handles the provided test cases, potential edge cases (such as sublists with identical strings and an empty input list), and that the `sorted` function is stable, maintaining the order of equal elements.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, we observe that the comments describe the state of the program before and after the function call accurately. Before the function call, `list_of_lists` is indeed a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. After the function call, the returned value is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as in the original sublists but sorted alphabetically.

The provided annotations align with the original assessment and do not introduce any new information that would suggest the program is incorrect. The program seems to meet the problem description by sorting each sublist of strings in ascending (alphabetical) order, and the annotations support this behavior.

Given that the annotations are consistent with the expected behavior, and considering that we assume the input to the program will always be valid (i.e., a list of lists where each sublist contains strings), the program appears to correctly implement the requested functionality.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
