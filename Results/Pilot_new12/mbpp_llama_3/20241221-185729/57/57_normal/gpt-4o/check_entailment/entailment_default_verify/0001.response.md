The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of strings as input, sorts each sublist in ascending alphabetical order using the `sorted` function, and returns the resulting list of lists. The output hints confirm this behavior, indicating that the function sorts each sublist's strings alphabetically, handles empty input lists and sublists correctly, and does not modify the original input.

The function's implementation is straightforward and aligns with the problem description. The list comprehension `[sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]` effectively sorts each sublist, and the `sorted` function ensures that the sorting is done alphabetically.

The output hints also suggest that the function does not perform error checking on the input and assumes that the input is a list of lists containing only strings. However, since the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, this does not affect the program's correctness.

Given that the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the refined assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
