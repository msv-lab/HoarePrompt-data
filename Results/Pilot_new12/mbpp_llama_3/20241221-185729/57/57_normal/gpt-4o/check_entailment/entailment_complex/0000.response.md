Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input, sorts each sublist's strings alphabetically, and returns the resulting list of lists. The program assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings, and it does not perform any error checking.

The key lines of code that achieve the desired functionality are:
- The list comprehension `[sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]`, which iterates over each sublist in the input list, sorts it alphabetically using the `sorted` function, and returns a new list with the sorted sublists.

The function also handles edge cases correctly, such as:
- If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, as demonstrated by the fact that the list comprehension will not be executed in this case.
- If any of the sublists are empty, they will be returned as empty lists, because the `sorted` function will return an empty list when given an empty list as input.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves correctly for different inputs, including lists with different numbers of sublists and sublists with different numbers of strings. 

Overall, the program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles edge cases correctly.
