Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists and applies the `sorted` function to each sublist. This results in a new list of lists where each sublist's strings are sorted in alphabetical order.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness, showing that it works as expected for different input cases. Additionally, the output hints describe the function's behavior accurately, including its handling of empty lists and sublists, as well as its assumption that the input is a list of lists containing only strings.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's lack of error checking does not affect its correctness. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct for every potential case.
