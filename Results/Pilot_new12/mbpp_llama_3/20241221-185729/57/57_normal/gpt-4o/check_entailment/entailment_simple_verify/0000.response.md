Based on the provided problem description, original code, original assessment, and annotated code, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks to write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The original code uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist, which sorts the strings in lexicographical order.

The original assessment correctly points out that the `sorted` function is case-sensitive, which might be a potential edge case to consider. However, since the problem description does not specify a case-insensitive sort, the original code's behavior is consistent with the standard behavior of the `sorted` function in Python.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the state of the program before the function call is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings, and that the function returns a list of lists with the same strings but sorted alphabetically.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program, covering different scenarios such as sorting lists with different lengths and containing different types of strings.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
