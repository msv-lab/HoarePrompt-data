Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist.

Upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where it does not meet the problem description. The `sorted` function sorts the elements of each sublist in lexicographical order, which is the standard way to compare strings in Python.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program. They cover different scenarios, such as sorting lists with different lengths and containing different types of strings, and the program produces the expected results.

One potential edge case to consider is the handling of empty sublists. However, the `sorted` function can handle empty lists without any issues, returning an empty list as expected.

Another edge case is the handling of sublists containing strings with varying cases. The `sorted` function is case-sensitive, so it treats uppercase letters as smaller than lowercase letters. If the problem description intended for a case-insensitive sort, the program would need to be modified to use the `key` argument of the `sorted` function to specify a case-insensitive comparison function.

However, based on the provided unit tests and the standard behavior of the `sorted` function, I believe that the program meets the problem description and is correct.
