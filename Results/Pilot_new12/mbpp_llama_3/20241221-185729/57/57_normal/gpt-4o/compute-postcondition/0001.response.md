The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of lists. This returned list of lists contains the same strings as in the original sublists, but the strings in each sublist are sorted alphabetically. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists of strings and returns the same list of lists with each sublist's strings sorted alphabetically.**
