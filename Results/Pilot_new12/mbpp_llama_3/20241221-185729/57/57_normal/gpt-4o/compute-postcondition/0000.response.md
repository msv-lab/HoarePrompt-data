To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state. The initial state is that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. The code provided is a list comprehension that sorts each sublist in `list_of_lists` and returns a new list of these sorted sublists.

Given this, the code `[sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]` will iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, sort the strings in each sublist (which will be sorted alphabetically by default since they are strings), and then return a new list containing these sorted sublists.

Therefore, the output state is a list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as in the original sublists but sorted alphabetically.

Output State: **A list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as in the original sublists but sorted alphabetically.**
