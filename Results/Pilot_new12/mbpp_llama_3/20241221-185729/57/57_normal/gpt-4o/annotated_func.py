#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #A list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as in the original sublists but sorted alphabetically.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, sorts each sublist's strings alphabetically, and returns the resulting list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If any of the sublists are empty, they will be returned as empty lists. The function does not modify the original input list or its sublists, but instead returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input contains non-string elements or non-list sublists, the function's behavior is undefined. The function's output will have the same structure as the input, but with each sublist's strings sorted in alphabetical order.
