The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists and `list1` is guaranteed to not be empty. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that combines all elements from `list1` except the last one, with all elements from `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a concatenated list of all elements in `list1` except the last one, and all elements in `list2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, where list1 and list2 are lists and list1 is not empty, and returns a concatenated list of all elements in list1 except the last one and all elements in list2.**
