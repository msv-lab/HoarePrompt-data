To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `list1` and `list2` are lists.
- `list1` is not empty.

The code snippet is:
```python
return list1[:-1] + list2
```

This code does the following:
1. `list1[:-1]` slices `list1` to include all elements except the last one.
2. `+ list2` concatenates the sliced `list1` with `list2`.

Given that `list1` is not empty, `list1[:-1]` will be a list containing all elements of `list1` except the last one. If `list1` has only one element, `list1[:-1]` will be an empty list.

The code then concatenates this result with `list2`, which can be any list (empty or not).

Therefore, the program returns a new list that is the concatenation of:
- All elements of `list1` except the last one (or an empty list if `list1` has only one element).
- All elements of `list2`.

Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of all elements in `list1` except the last one and all elements in `list2`.**
