## Step-by-step analysis of the program:
1. **Understanding the problem description**: The problem requires a function to take two lists as input, replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list, and return the resulting list.
2. **Analyzing the provided function**: The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements in `list1` except the last one (`list1[:-1]`) and all elements in `list2`.
3. **Comparing with the problem description**: The provided function `func_1` indeed works as per the problem description. It correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`) by concatenating `list1` (excluding its last element) with `list2`.
4. **Considering edge cases**: Although the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle edge cases (like an empty second list), the provided function handles them implicitly by still producing a valid output in the context of Python's list operations.

## Explanation of the correctness:
The program is correct because it implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The line `return list1[:-1] + list2` effectively removes the last element of `list1` and appends all elements of `list2`, meeting the problem's requirements.

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$
