Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists. Since the condition in the if statement is just `list1`, which is given as not empty in the precondition, the if part will always be executed when the precondition is met, meaning `list1` will have its last element replaced with the elements of `list2`. The else part, stating `list1` is equal to `list2`, will not be reached under the given precondition that `list1` is not empty. Therefore, after the execution, `list1` will be a list with its last element replaced with the elements of `list2`, and `list2` remains a list.**
