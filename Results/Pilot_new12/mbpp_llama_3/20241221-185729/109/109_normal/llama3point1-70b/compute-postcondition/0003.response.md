The code `list1 = list2` assigns the value of `list2` to `list1`. Given that `list1` is empty, this operation effectively overwrites the empty list with a reference to `list2`. Thus, after execution, both `list1` and `list2` reference the same list object.

Output State: **`list1` is equal to `list2`, and both are lists**
