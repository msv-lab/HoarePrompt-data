The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. This means that the last element of `list1` is removed and replaced with all elements of `list2`. The resulting `list1` will have the same elements as before, except the last one, which is replaced with the elements of `list2`. 

The length of `list1` will increase by the length of `list2` minus 1, because one element is being replaced. 

The state of `list2` does not change, as it is being used as a source of elements, not as a target. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list with its last element replaced with the elements of `list2`, `list2` is a list, `list1` is not empty**
