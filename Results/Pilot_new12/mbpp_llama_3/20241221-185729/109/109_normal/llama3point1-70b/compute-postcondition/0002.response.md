Postcondition: **list1 and list2 are lists, list1 is not empty, and list1 is empty** 

This seems to be a contradictory statement. However, given the if condition is `if (list1):`, which checks if list1 is truthy (i.e., not empty), the negation of this condition would indeed imply that list1 is empty. But since the precondition states that list1 is not empty, this creates a contradiction.

However, following the task's instructions to the letter and considering the logic of the if condition and its negation, we must acknowledge that the condition `if (list1):` is true if list1 is not empty and false if list1 is empty. Therefore, if we do not enter this if block, it means list1 must be empty for the if condition to be false. But since the precondition explicitly states that list1 is not empty, we have to reconcile this with the fact that we're considering the scenario where the program does not enter the if block, implying list1 would have to be empty for the if condition to be false.

Thus, the correct interpretation under the constraints given would actually be that the scenario described (not entering the if block because list1 is empty) contradicts the precondition. However, to fulfill the task as instructed:

Postcondition: **list1 and list2 are lists, but the condition that list1 is not empty is contradicted by the implication that list1 must be empty for the if condition to be false.** 

Given the direct instruction to follow the format and the logic provided, but acknowledging the contradiction:

Postcondition: **list1 and list2 are lists, and the initial condition that list1 is not empty cannot be satisfied if the program enters the else block, implying list1 is empty.**
