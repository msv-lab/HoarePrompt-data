Given the initial state, `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `list1` is not empty. The code will replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2` because the if condition is met due to `list1` being not empty. 

After the execution, `list1` becomes a modified list where its last element is replaced with all elements from `list2`, and `list2` remains unchanged as it's just used in the modification of `list1`.

Therefore, the program returns `list1`, which is a list with its last original element replaced by the elements of `list2`.

Output State: **The program returns list1, which is a list where its last element has been replaced with all elements from list2.**
