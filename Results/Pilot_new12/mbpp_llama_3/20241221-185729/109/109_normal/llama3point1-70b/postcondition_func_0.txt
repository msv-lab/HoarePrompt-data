The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1`. The function returns the modified `list1`, which is a list where its last element has been replaced with all elements of `list2` if `list1` was not empty, or is equal to `list2` if `list1` was empty. The function modifies the original `list1` in-place if it is not empty. The state of `list2` remains unchanged.
