You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists, and list1 is not empty.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `list1` and `list2` are lists. Since the condition in the if statement is just `list1`, which is given as not empty in the precondition, the if part will always be executed when the precondition is met, meaning `list1` will have its last element replaced with the elements of `list2`. The else part, stating `list1` is equal to `list2`, will not be reached under the given precondition that `list1` is not empty. Therefore, after the execution, `list1` will be a list with its last element replaced with the elements of `list2`, and `list2` remains a list.
    return list1
    #The program returns list1, which is a list where its last element has been replaced with all elements from list2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, where both are lists. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1`. The function returns the modified `list1`, which is a list where its last element has been replaced with all elements of `list2` if `list1` was not empty, or is equal to `list2` if `list1` was empty. The function modifies the original `list1` in-place if it is not empty. The state of `list2` remains unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
