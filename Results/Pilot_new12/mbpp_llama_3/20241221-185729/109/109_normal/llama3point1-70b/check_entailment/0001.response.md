Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input and replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it sets `list1` equal to `list2`. This function correctly handles both cases where `list1` is not empty and where it is empty.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly:

- When `list1` is not empty, `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements from `list2`. This operation modifies `list1` in-place and then returns the modified list.

- When `list1` is empty, the function sets `list1` equal to `list2` and then returns `list2`. This is a correct interpretation of the problem description for the edge case where `list1` has no elements.

Given that the function handles both the primary case (where `list1` is not empty) and the edge case (where `list1` is empty) correctly, and it accurately implements the behavior described in the problem statement, the conclusion is that the function works as expected for all potential inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**. 

Example use cases:
```python
# Test case 1: list1 is not empty
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5]
print(func_1(list1, list2))  # Expected output: [1, 2, [4, 5]]

# Test case 2: list1 is empty
list1 = []
list2 = [4, 5]
print(func_1(list1, list2))  # Expected output: [4, 5]

# Test case 3: list2 is empty
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = []
print(func_1(list1, list2))  # Expected output: [1, 2, []]
```
