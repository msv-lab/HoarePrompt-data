Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2` if `list1` is not empty. If `list1` is empty, it simply assigns `list2` to `list1`. The function modifies the original `list1` in-place if it is not empty and returns the modified `list1`.

The code handles both the cases where `list1` is empty and where it is not empty correctly. The line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2` when `list1` is not empty, and the line `list1 = list2` assigns `list2` to `list1` when `list1` is empty.

The output hints also agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior, which further confirms that the code is correct. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the code does not handle according to the problem description, and it always produces the expected output. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
