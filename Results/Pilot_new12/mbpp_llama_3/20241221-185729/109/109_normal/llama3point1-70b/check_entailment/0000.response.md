Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(list1, list2)` correctly replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. 

Here are some potential cases to consider:

1. `list1` is not empty: In this case, `list1[-1:] = list2` will correctly replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
2. `list1` is empty: In this case, `list1 = list2` will set `list1` to be equal to `list2`. Although `list1` is reassigned, the function returns the updated `list1`, which is now equal to `list2`. This is the expected behavior based on the problem description.
3. `list2` is empty: In this case, `list1[-1:] = list2` will remove the last element from `list1`, since `list2` is empty.
4. `list2` has multiple elements: In this case, `list1[-1:] = list2` will replace the last element of `list1` with multiple elements.

Since all potential cases have been considered, and the program behaves as expected in each case, the program is correct.
