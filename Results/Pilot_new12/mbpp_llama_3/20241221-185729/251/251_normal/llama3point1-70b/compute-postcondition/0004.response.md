Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the polar coordinates of a point given its Cartesian coordinates. It accepts two real numbers, x and y, and returns two values: r, the non-negative square root of the sum of the squares of x and y (equivalent to the distance from the origin to the point), and phi, the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point, as determined by the atan2 function. The function handles all real number inputs, including zero and negative values, and returns the results accordingly, with no modifications made to the input values. The function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that x and y are always real numbers.**
