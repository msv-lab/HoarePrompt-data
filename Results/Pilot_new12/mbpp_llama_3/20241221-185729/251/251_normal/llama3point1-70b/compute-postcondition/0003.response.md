The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `r`, a non-negative real number equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `phi`, the angle in radians equal to the atan2 of `y` and `x`.
