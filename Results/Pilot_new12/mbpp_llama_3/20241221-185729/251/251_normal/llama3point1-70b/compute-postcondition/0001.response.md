To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

`phi = math.atan2(y, x)`

This line of code calculates the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, and it also takes into account the quadrant of the point `(x, y)`.

Given the initial state: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`

The value of `phi` will be the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`. 

The states of `x`, `y`, and `r` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, and `phi` is the angle in radians equal to `atan2(y, x)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, and `phi` is the angle in radians equal to `atan2(y, x)`**
