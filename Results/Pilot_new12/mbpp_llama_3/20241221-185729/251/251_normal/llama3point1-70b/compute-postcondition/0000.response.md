To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code `r = math.hypot(x, y)` calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and assigns this value to `r`. This operation does not change the values of `x` and `y` but introduces a new variable `r` whose value depends on `x` and `y`.

Given that `x` and `y` are real numbers, the value of `r` will be the non-negative square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, i.e., `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. This is because `math.hypot(x, y)` returns the Euclidean norm, `sqrt(x*x + y*y)`, which is always non-negative due to the nature of the square root function and the squaring of `x` and `y`.

The states of `x` and `y` are not affected by this operation; they remain real numbers. Only a new variable, `r`, is introduced with a value determined by `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`**
