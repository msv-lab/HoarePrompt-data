The program returns `r` and `phi`. `r` is a non-negative real number equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are real numbers. `phi` is the angle in radians equal to the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`, where `x` and `y` are real numbers.
Output State: **The program returns r, a non-negative real number equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2), and phi, the angle in radians equal to atan2(y, x), where x and y are real numbers**
