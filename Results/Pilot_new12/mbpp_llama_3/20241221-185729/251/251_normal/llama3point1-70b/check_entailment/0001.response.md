Correctness: **True**

The provided program converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius (`r`) and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle (`phi`). 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments, i.e., `math.hypot(x, y)` is equivalent to `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. This is the correct formula for calculating the radius in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function calculates the arctangent of `y/x`, which is the correct formula for calculating the angle in polar coordinates. It also handles the case where `x` is zero, and it returns the correct angle in the correct quadrant.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when `x` or `y` is zero, and when `x` and `y` have the same or opposite signs. 

For example, if we call `func_1(3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates `(5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`, which corresponds to the rectangular coordinates `(3, 4)`. 

Similarly, if we call `func_1(-3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates `(5.0, 2.214297435588181)`, which corresponds to the rectangular coordinates `(-3, 4)`.

In all cases, the program correctly converts the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct.
