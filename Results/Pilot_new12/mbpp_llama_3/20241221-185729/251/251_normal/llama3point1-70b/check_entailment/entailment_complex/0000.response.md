Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Conversion to Polar Coordinates**: The function `func_1(x, y)` takes Cartesian coordinates `x` and `y` as input and returns the polar coordinates `r` and `phi`.
2. **Calculation of `r`**: The program calculates `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which is equivalent to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. This matches the problem description, which states that `r` should be the non-negative square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`.
3. **Calculation of `phi`**: The program calculates `phi` using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point. This also matches the problem description.
4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As stated in the problem description, we assume that the input values `x` and `y` are always real numbers. The program does not perform any explicit error checking, but since we assume valid input, this is not a concern.
5. **Handling of Zero and Negative Values**: The `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` functions can handle zero and negative input values correctly, which aligns with the problem description.

In summary, the program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, meeting all the requirements stated in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
