Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the distance `r` from the origin to the point using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which is equivalent to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. It also calculates the angle `phi` in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point using `math.atan2(y, x)`.

The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. Additionally, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle in the range of `-pi` to `pi`, which is the standard range for polar coordinates.

The code handles all real number inputs, including zero and negative values, correctly. It does not perform any error checking on the input values, but based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input will be valid.

The output hints agree with the code, and no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
