You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius (`r`) and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle (`phi`). 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments, i.e., `math.hypot(x, y)` is equivalent to `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. This is the correct formula for calculating the radius in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function calculates the arctangent of `y/x`, which is the correct formula for calculating the angle in polar coordinates. It also handles the case where `x` is zero, and it returns the correct angle in the correct quadrant.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when `x` or `y` is zero, and when `x` and `y` have the same or opposite signs. 

For example, if we call `func_1(3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates `(5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`, which corresponds to the rectangular coordinates `(3, 4)`. 

Similarly, if we call `func_1(-3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates `(5.0, 2.214297435588181)`, which corresponds to the rectangular coordinates `(-3, 4)`.

In all cases, the program correctly converts the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r, a non-negative real number equal to sqrt(x^2 + y^2), and phi, the angle in radians equal to atan2(y, x), where x and y are real numbers


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
