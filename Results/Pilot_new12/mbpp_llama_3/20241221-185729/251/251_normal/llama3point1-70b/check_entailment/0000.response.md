Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(x, y)` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. 

Here's why:

- The function `math.hypot(x, y)` is used to calculate the radial distance `r` from the origin. This is the correct formula for the distance in a 2D plane, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The `math.hypot` function is more numerically stable than directly calculating `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)` because it avoids the possibility of intermediate overflow.

- The function `math.atan2(y, x)` is used to calculate the azimuthal angle `phi` in radians. The `math.atan2` function is the correct choice here because it handles the case where `x` is zero and also provides the correct quadrant for the angle based on the signs of `x` and `y`.

There are no known edge cases where this implementation would fail to produce the correct polar coordinates, assuming the inputs are valid numbers. The function handles the origin `(0, 0)` correctly by returning `(0, 0)` because `math.hypot(0, 0)` is `0` and `math.atan2(0, 0)` is `0` (though the angle is technically undefined at the origin, returning `0` is a common convention).

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the implementation details, the function is correct for all potential cases.
