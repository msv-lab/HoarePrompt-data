The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Here's the breakdown of how it operates and whether it meets the problem description:

1. **Rectangular to Polar Conversion Formula**: The conversion from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, φ)` (where `r` is the radius and `φ` is the angle in radians) uses the following formulas:
   - `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`: This formula calculates the distance from the origin to the point in the Cartesian plane, which is the radius in polar coordinates.
   - `φ = atan2(y, x)`: This formula calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment that connects the origin to the point.

2. **Implementation in `func_1`**:
   - `r = math.hypot(x, y)`: This line computes the Euclidean norm, equivalent to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. The `math.hypot` function is used instead of directly computing `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)` for better numerical stability and to avoid potential overflow issues.
   - `phi = math.atan2(y, x)`: This line calculates the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(y, x)`. The `math.atan2` function returns the arc tangent of `y/x` in radians. The `atan2` function is specifically used because it handles the case where `x` is zero (to determine the correct quadrant) and it preserves the sign of the angle based on the signs of `y` and `x`.

3. **Correctness Based on Problem Description**: 
   - The function takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates.
   - It calculates and returns `r` and `phi`, representing the polar coordinates, using the standard mathematical formulas for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates.
   - The use of `math.hypot` and `math.atan2` ensures that the calculations are performed correctly for all possible input values (considering valid inputs as per the problem statement).

**Conclusion**: The provided function `func_1` accurately implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, adhering to the formulas and logic required for such a conversion. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
