You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius (`r`) and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle (`phi`). 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments, i.e., `math.hypot(x, y)` is equivalent to `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. This is the correct formula for calculating the radius in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function calculates the arctangent of `y/x`, which is the correct formula for calculating the angle in polar coordinates. It also handles the case where `x` is zero, and it returns the correct angle in the correct quadrant.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when `x` or `y` is zero, and when `x` and `y` have the same or opposite signs. 

For example, if we call `func_1(3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates `(5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`, which corresponds to the rectangular coordinates `(3, 4)`. 

Similarly, if we call `func_1(-3, 4)`, the function correctly returns the polar coordinates `(5.0, 2.214297435588181)`, which corresponds to the rectangular coordinates `(-3, 4)`.

In all cases, the program correctly converts the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the polar coordinates of a point given its Cartesian coordinates. It accepts two real numbers, x and y, and returns two values: r, the non-negative square root of the sum of the squares of x and y (equivalent to the distance from the origin to the point), and phi, the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point, as determined by the atan2 function. The function handles all real number inputs, including zero and negative values, and returns the results accordingly, with no modifications made to the input values. The function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that x and y are always real numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
