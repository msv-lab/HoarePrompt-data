Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two real numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns a tuple containing the radius `r` and the angle `phi` in radians. The calculations for `r` and `phi` are accurate, using the `math.hypot` function for the radius and `math.atan2` for the angle. 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, which gives the distance from the origin to the point, and `math.atan2` calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point. The use of `math.atan2` instead of `math.atan` ensures that the function correctly handles all four quadrants.

Additionally, the code does not modify the input values and handles all real number inputs, including zero and negative values, as expected. 

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., `x` and `y` are real numbers), the lack of error checking does not affect the correctness of the code for the specified domain of input values. 

Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case within the assumed valid input domain.
