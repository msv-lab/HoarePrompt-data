`theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which is the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The value of `x` and `y` are real numbers and `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`, and `theta` is the arctangent of `y/x` in radians.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`, and `theta` is `math.atan2(y, x)`**
