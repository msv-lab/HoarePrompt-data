The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing two values: the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` calculated as `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`, and the angle `phi` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are real numbers, and returns a tuple containing the non-negative distance from the origin to the point (x, y) and the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y).**
