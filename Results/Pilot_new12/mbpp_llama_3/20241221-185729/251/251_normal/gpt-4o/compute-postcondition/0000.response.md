The code calculates the value of `r` using the formula `r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, which is the Euclidean distance of the point `(x, y)` from the origin. 

Given that `x` and `y` are real numbers, `x ** 2` and `y ** 2` will also be real numbers (specifically, non-negative real numbers), and `x ** 2 + y ** 2` will be a non-negative real number. 

`math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` will be a non-negative real number, representing the distance of the point `(x, y)` from the origin.

The states of the variables `x` and `y` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to the square root of `x` squared plus `y` squared.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the non-negative real number equal to `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`**
