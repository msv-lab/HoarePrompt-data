The function `func_1` accepts two real number parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing two values: `r`, the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The function correctly handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the distance `r` as a non-negative value. The function does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y` and does not perform any error checking on the inputs, assuming they are always real numbers. The returned angle `theta` is in the range (-π, π] and the returned distance `r` is always non-negative.
