Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a correct implementation of a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

Here's why the code is correct:
- The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point.
- The distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, which is a non-negative value due to the properties of the `math.sqrt` function.
- The angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the angle in the range (-π, π].
- The function returns a tuple containing the calculated distance `r` and angle `theta`.
- The provided unit tests (assert statements) demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input values.

Since the function handles all possible real number inputs and calculates the polar coordinates correctly, and considering that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct for every potential case.
