Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It calculates the radius (`r`) using the Pythagorean theorem and the angle (`theta`) using the `math.atan2` function, which handles the case where `x` is zero.

The use of `math.atan2` is particularly important, as it ensures the correct quadrant for the angle based on the signs of `x` and `y`. This function also returns the result in radians, which is the conventional unit for angles in polar coordinates.

The provided unit tests further confirm the correctness of the program, covering various cases with different input values. 

There are no edge cases or potential errors that the program does not handle, as it correctly calculates the polar coordinates for all possible rectangular coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
