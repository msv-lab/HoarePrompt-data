Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

The problem description asks to write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It then calculates the polar coordinates using the formulas `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and `theta = atan2(y, x)`, where `r` is the distance from the origin to the point and `theta` is the angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin and the point.

The `math.sqrt` function calculates the square root, and `math.atan2` calculates the arctangent of `y/x`, handling the case where `x` is zero and returning an angle in the correct quadrant. The function returns a tuple containing `r` and `theta`, as required.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) verify that the function works correctly for several cases, and since the program uses standard mathematical formulas to perform the conversion, it will work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
