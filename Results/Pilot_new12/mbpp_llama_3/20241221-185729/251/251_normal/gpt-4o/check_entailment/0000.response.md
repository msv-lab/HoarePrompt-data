Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)`. The function correctly calculates the radius `r` using the Pythagorean theorem (`math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`) and the angle `theta` using the `math.atan2` function, which handles the quadrant correctly.

The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to ensure that the angle is calculated correctly in all quadrants. This is because `math.atan` only returns angles between `-pi/2` and `pi/2`, whereas `math.atan2` returns angles between `-pi` and `pi`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles different input values, and the use of `math.atan2` ensures that the angle is calculated correctly in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
