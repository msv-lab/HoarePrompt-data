Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function takes two real number parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing two values: `r`, the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`.

The function correctly handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the distance `r` as a non-negative value. The returned angle `theta` is in the range (-π, π].

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`, `assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)`, and `assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)`, demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases.

Overall, the function correctly implements the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates, and there are no apparent cases where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description.
