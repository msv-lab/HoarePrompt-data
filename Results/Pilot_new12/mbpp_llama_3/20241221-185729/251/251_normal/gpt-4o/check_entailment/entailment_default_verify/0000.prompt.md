You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, theta)`. The function correctly calculates the radius `r` using the Pythagorean theorem (`math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`) and the angle `theta` using the `math.atan2` function, which handles the quadrant correctly.

The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to ensure that the angle is calculated correctly in all quadrants. This is because `math.atan` only returns angles between `-pi/2` and `pi/2`, whereas `math.atan2` returns angles between `-pi` and `pi`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles different input values, and the use of `math.atan2` ensures that the angle is calculated correctly in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two real number parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing two values: `r`, the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The function correctly handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the distance `r` as a non-negative value. The function does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y` and does not perform any error checking on the inputs, assuming they are always real numbers. The returned angle `theta` is in the range (-π, π] and the returned distance `r` is always non-negative.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
