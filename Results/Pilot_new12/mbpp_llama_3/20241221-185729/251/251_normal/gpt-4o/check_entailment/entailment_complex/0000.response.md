Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It follows the problem description by calculating the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` using `math.atan2(y, x)`.

The function `func_1` takes two real number parameters `x` and `y` and returns a tuple containing two values: `r` and `theta`, as described in the problem description. The function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the distance `r` as a non-negative value. The returned angle `theta` is in the range (-π, π] and the returned distance `r` is always non-negative.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function by checking that it produces the expected results for different input values.

Overall, the program accurately implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, as specified in the problem description, and handles all cases correctly.
