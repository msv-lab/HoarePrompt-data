The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the last character of an empty string. The function does not modify the input tuple or have any side effects beyond returning the resulting list of characters.
