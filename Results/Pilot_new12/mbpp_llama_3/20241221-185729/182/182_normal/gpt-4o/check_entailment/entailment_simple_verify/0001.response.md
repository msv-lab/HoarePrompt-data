The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple, which meets the requirements in the problem description.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. The state of the program right before the function call is a tuple of strings, and the program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple `tup`, which is the expected result.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function, showing that it works as expected for different input tuples.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True**, since the program meets the problem description, the annotations support the correctness, and the unit tests demonstrate the function's expected behavior.

Final: **True**
