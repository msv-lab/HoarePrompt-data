Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple and return it as a list.

The function uses a list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`. For each string, `s[-1]` is used to get the last character (since Python uses 0-based indexing and `-1` refers to the last index). The resulting list of last characters is then returned.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different tuples of strings, further confirming its correctness.

In general, the program will work correctly for any tuple of non-empty strings, as it relies on standard Python indexing behavior. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the program does not need to include error checking for empty strings or non-string elements in the tuple. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the correctness of the program can be confirmed as **True**.
