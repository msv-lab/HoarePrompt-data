Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extract the last character of each string using `s[-1]`.

The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description for all valid input cases. It returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is also consistent with the expected behavior.

The function does not attempt to handle any invalid input cases, such as an empty string in the tuple, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern. The function's behavior is well-defined and correct for all valid input cases, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
