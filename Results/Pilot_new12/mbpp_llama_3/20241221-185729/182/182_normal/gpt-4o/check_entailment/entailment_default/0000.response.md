Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a function that extracts the last character of each string in a given tuple. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing the last character of each string, accessed using `s[-1]`. 

The function description and output hints agree with the code. The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem. For example, if the input tuple contains strings with multiple characters, the function will return the last character of each string. If the input tuple contains strings with a single character, the function will return that character. 

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the code. The tests demonstrate the function's behavior with different input tuples and verify that the output matches the expected result.

One potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this issue is not considered a correctness problem in this context.
