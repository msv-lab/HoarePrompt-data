Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses a list comprehension to extract the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple. This is achieved by using the indexing syntax `s[-1]`, which refers to the last character of a string `s`.

The code is correct for several reasons:

1. It handles tuples of any length, including empty tuples.
2. It correctly extracts the last character of each string, regardless of the string's length.
3. It handles strings of any length, including empty strings (although this may not be a typical use case).
4. The list comprehension syntax is concise and readable, making the code easy to understand.

I couldn't think of a single case where the program does not work as expected. The test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the program. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
