The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **True**. Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I agree with the original assessment. 

The problem description requires a function to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a list comprehension with `s[-1]` to access the last character of each string in the input tuple `tup`. 

The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. 

The unit tests also support the correctness of the function, demonstrating that it produces the expected output for different input tuples. 

One potential issue mentioned in the annotated version is that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError. However, since we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors, this is not a concern.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness.

Final: **True**
