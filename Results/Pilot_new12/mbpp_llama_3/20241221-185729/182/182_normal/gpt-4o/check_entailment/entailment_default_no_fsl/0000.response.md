Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it does exactly what the problem description says: it extracts the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple and returns them as a list of characters. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` is a concise and efficient way to achieve this. 

The code handles all the potential cases mentioned in the output hints: if the input tuple is empty, the function returns an empty list; and if any string in the tuple is not empty, the function correctly returns its last character.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the code for different input tuples. Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty tuple of non-empty strings), the code does not need to handle edge cases like empty strings or tuples. Therefore, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
