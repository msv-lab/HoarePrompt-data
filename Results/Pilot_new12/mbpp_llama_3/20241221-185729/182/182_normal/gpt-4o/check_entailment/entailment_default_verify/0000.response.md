The original assessment states that the program is correct because it handles tuples of any length, extracts the last character of each string correctly, and handles strings of any length. However, the output hints reveal a crucial detail that contradicts the original assessment: the program raises an IndexError when it encounters an empty string in the tuple.

The problem description asks for a function that extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, but it does not specify what should happen when an empty string is encountered. However, based on the provided output hints, we can infer that the program does not handle empty strings well, as it raises an exception.

Given this new information, we must refine the original assessment. The program is not entirely correct because it does not handle empty strings as a valid input. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the program handles all possible inputs without issues.

Therefore, based on the output hints and the problem description, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements as specified.

Final: **False**
