Since `strings` is a tuple of strings, we can use this information to understand what the code will return. The code `[s[-1] for s in strings]` creates a new list where each element is the last character of the corresponding string in `strings`. 

Given that `s[-1]` refers to the last character of any string `s`, this list comprehension will iterate through each string in `strings` and extract its last character.

Output State: **The program returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple 'strings'**
