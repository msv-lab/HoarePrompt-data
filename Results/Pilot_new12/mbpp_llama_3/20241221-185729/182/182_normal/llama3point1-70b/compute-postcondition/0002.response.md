Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the last character of an empty string. The function does not modify the original tuple of strings. The returned list will have the same length as the number of strings in the input tuple, with each element being the last character of the corresponding string. The function handles strings of any length and content, and it does not perform any error checking or handling beyond what is implicitly done by the list comprehension and indexing operations.**
