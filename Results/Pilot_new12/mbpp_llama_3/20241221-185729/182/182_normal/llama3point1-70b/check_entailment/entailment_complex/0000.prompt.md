You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple 'strings'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the last character of an empty string. The function does not modify the original tuple of strings. The returned list will have the same length as the number of strings in the input tuple, with each element being the last character of the corresponding string. The function handles strings of any length and content, and it does not perform any error checking or handling beyond what is implicitly done by the list comprehension and indexing operations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
