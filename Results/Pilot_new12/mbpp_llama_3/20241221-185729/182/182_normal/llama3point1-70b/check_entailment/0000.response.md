Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input tuple and extract the last character of each string using `s[-1]`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because:

1. It handles strings of any length, including empty strings, correctly. However, attempting to access the last character of an empty string would raise an `IndexError`. So, this may not be considered correct for all potential cases if the input tuple can contain empty strings.

2. It works correctly for tuples containing any number of strings.

However, a potential issue could be when the input tuple contains empty strings. In such cases, attempting to access the last character would raise an `IndexError`. 

To demonstrate, consider the following example:
```python
print(func_1(("", "hello", "world"))) 
# This would raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception
```
This indicates the function does not handle empty strings correctly, and therefore, the Correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails when the input tuple contains an empty string. A correct implementation should add a check to handle empty strings. For instance, it could return a specific value (like `None`) or raise a custom error when encountering an empty string. Here's an updated version that handles empty strings by returning `None` for such cases:

```python
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] if s else None for s in strings]
```
