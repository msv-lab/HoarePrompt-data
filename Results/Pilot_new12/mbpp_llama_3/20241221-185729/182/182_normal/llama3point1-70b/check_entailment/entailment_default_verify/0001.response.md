Based on the provided problem description, the Python function `func_1`, the original assessment, and the output hints, I have analyzed the code's functionality.

The original assessment concludes that the function is correct because it handles tuples of any length, including empty tuples, and correctly extracts the last character from each string. It also mentions that the function will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception when trying to access the last character of an empty string, which aligns with the expected behavior.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a tuple of strings, returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple, and does not modify the original tuple of strings. They also mention that the function will raise an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty.

Given that the problem description asks for a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, and considering the output hints and the original assessment, I conclude that the program meets the problem description. The function correctly handles the extraction of the last character from each string in the tuple and returns the expected results.

The original assessment is accurate because it thoroughly analyzes the function's behavior and considers various potential cases, including empty tuples and strings of any length. The output hints provide additional confirmation of the function's correctness and align with the original assessment.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
