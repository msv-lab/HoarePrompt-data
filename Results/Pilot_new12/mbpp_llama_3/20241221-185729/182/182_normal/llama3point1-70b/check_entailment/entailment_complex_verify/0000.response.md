The original assessment states that the program is correct, but then proceeds to point out a crucial flaw in the program: it does not handle empty strings correctly. The annotated version of the code confirms this issue, stating that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError. This is a clear indication that the program does not meet the problem description, as it fails to handle all possible cases (including empty strings).

Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I believe that the program is incorrect because it does not handle empty strings. The annotated version provides a clear description of the program's behavior, including the fact that it will raise an IndexError when attempting to access the last character of an empty string. This is a critical flaw that the original assessment correctly identifies.

Therefore, I maintain the corrected assessment provided after the original assessment, which states that the Correctness is **False**.

The reason for this assessment is that the program fails to handle a specific case (empty strings) that is a valid input according to the problem description. The program's behavior in this case (raising an IndexError) is not in line with the expected behavior of extracting the last character of each string in the tuple.

Final: **False**
