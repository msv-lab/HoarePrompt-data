Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle the case when any string in the tuple is empty. According to the output hints, if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the last character of an empty string. This is an indication that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it does not gracefully handle empty strings. The problem description asks to extract the rear index element of each string, but it does not explicitly state what should happen for empty strings. However, raising an exception is not explicitly mentioned either, and it could be argued that the function should return a specific value (e.g., None) or an empty string to indicate that the input string is empty. Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
