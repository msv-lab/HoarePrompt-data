Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple.

The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` is used to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings`. For each string, the last character is accessed using `s[-1]`. The list of last characters is then returned.

This implementation correctly extracts the last character of each string in the input tuple, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Therefore, the program is correct and should work as expected for any valid input. 

For example, if the input tuple is `("abc", "def", "ghi")`, the function will return `['c', 'f', 'i']`, which are the last characters of each string in the tuple.
