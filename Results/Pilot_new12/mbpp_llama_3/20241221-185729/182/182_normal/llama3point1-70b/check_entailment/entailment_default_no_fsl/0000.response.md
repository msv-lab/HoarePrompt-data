Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input tuple contains an empty string. When the function attempts to access the last character of an empty string using `s[-1]`, it raises an `IndexError` because there are no characters to access. According to the problem description, the function should extract the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, but it does not provide any guidance on handling empty strings. However, based on the output hints, it is clear that the function will not work correctly in this case.

To fix this issue, the function could be modified to include error checking to handle empty strings. For example, it could return a default value, such as `None` or an empty string, when an empty string is encountered. However, without additional guidance from the problem description, it is unclear what the correct behavior should be in this case.

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle empty strings:

```python
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] if s else None for s in strings]
```

This modified function will return `None` for any empty strings in the input tuple, avoiding the `IndexError` that would be raised by the original function.
