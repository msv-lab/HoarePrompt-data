Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` is the key part of the code that achieves this. It iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character of each string using `s[-1]`. The resulting list of last characters is then returned by the function.

The program handles the case where the input tuple is empty correctly, as the list comprehension will simply return an empty list `[]` in this case.

The program also handles the case where each string in the tuple is non-empty correctly, as it simply extracts the last character of each string.

The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program is also satisfied, as the problem description does not specify any error handling requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says, assuming valid input.
