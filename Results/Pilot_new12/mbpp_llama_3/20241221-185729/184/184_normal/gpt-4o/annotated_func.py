#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the original list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the even integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The input list remains unchanged. The function handles empty lists as input, returning an empty list in such cases. It also correctly handles lists containing a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers, including edge cases where the list contains only even or only odd integers, or a single integer. The output list will always contain integers, and will be empty if the input list contains only even integers.
