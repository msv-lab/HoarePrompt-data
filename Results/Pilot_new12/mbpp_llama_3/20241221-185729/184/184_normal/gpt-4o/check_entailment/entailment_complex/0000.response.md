Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` filters out the even numbers from the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. This is achieved using a list comprehension with a conditional statement `num % 2!= 0`, which checks if a number is odd.

The program handles various cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: The function will return an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to filter.
* Lists containing a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers: The function correctly identifies and filters out the even numbers.
* Lists containing only even or only odd integers: The function returns the correct result, which is an empty list for the former case and the original list for the latter case.
* Single integer input: The function will return a list containing the single integer if it is odd, or an empty list if it is even.

The program does not modify the original input list and always returns a list of integers, which meets the problem description's requirements.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and verify that the function returns the expected output.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and its behavior aligns with the problem description.
