Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers using a list comprehension. The condition `num % 2!= 0` effectively identifies odd numbers, and the function returns a new list containing only these numbers.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that the program returns a list of odd integers from the original list `nums`. The annotations do not reveal any inconsistencies or flaws in the original assessment.

The original assessment also mentions that the function handles edge cases correctly, such as an empty input list or a list with a single element. Although these cases are not explicitly tested, the function's implementation suggests that it would handle them as expected.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the problem description, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
