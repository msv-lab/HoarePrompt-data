Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct as it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` uses list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers from a given list of numbers. 

The condition `num % 2!= 0` correctly checks if a number is odd (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is not equal to 0). This logic is applied to each number in the input list, and the resulting list of odd numbers is returned.

All the provided test cases (`assert` statements) pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Additionally, there are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle. For example, it correctly handles:

* An empty list: `func_1([])` returns an empty list `[]`
* A list with only even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` returns an empty list `[]`
* A list with only one odd number: `func_1([5])` returns a list `[5]`
* A list with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` returns a list `[-1, -3]`

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and there are no apparent issues with the logic, the program can be considered correct.
