Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is equivalent to checking if a number is odd.

The code is correct because it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list, checks if it's odd, and if so, includes it in the output list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios, including lists with both odd and even numbers, lists with only even numbers (in which case the function should return an empty list, but this case is not tested), and lists with only odd numbers.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with a single element, correctly.

To further verify the correctness of the function, one could test it with additional inputs, such as:

* An empty list: `func_1([]) == []`
* A list with a single odd element: `func_1([5]) == [5]`
* A list with a single even element: `func_1([4]) == []`
* A list with multiple consecutive odd elements: `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7]) == [1, 3, 5, 7]`

However, based on the provided code and unit tests, it appears that the function is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
