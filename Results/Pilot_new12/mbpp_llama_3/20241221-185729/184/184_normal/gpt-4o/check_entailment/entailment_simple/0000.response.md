Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each number in the input list and checks if it is odd by using the condition `num % 2!= 0`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: Although the problem statement assumes that the input will always be a valid list of integers, the function is designed to handle any iterable input. If the input is not a list, the function will still work as long as it is an iterable.

2. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2!= 0]` is used to create a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list. This is done by iterating over each number `num` in the input list `nums` and checking if it is odd by using the condition `num % 2!= 0`. If the number is odd, it is included in the new list.

3. **Correctness of the Condition**: The condition `num % 2!= 0` is used to check if a number is odd. This condition is correct because in integer division, a remainder of 0 indicates that the number is even, while a non-zero remainder indicates that the number is odd.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, the test case `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` shows that the function correctly filters out the even numbers from the input list and returns a list containing only the odd numbers.

Overall, the program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles the input correctly.
