Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that filters out even integers from a given list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension with a conditional statement (`num % 2!= 0`) to check whether each number in the input list is odd. If the number is odd, it is included in the output list.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function correctly handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists containing only even or only odd integers, and lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers.

The code correctly handles every potential case as described in the problem description. The function is designed to accept a list of integers as input and return a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The input list remains unchanged.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function by checking its output for different input scenarios. These tests cover various cases, including lists with both even and odd integers, lists with only odd integers, and lists with a mix of positive and negative integers.

Given that the code aligns with the problem description, handles edge cases as mentioned in the output hints, and passes the provided unit tests, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
