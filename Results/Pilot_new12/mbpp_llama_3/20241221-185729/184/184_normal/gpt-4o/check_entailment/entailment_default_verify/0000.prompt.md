You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is equivalent to checking if a number is odd.

The code is correct because it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list, checks if it's odd, and if so, includes it in the output list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios, including lists with both odd and even numbers, lists with only even numbers (in which case the function should return an empty list, but this case is not tested), and lists with only odd numbers.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with a single element, correctly.

To further verify the correctness of the function, one could test it with additional inputs, such as:

* An empty list: `func_1([]) == []`
* A list with a single odd element: `func_1([5]) == [5]`
* A list with a single even element: `func_1([4]) == []`
* A list with multiple consecutive odd elements: `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7]) == [1, 3, 5, 7]`

However, based on the provided code and unit tests, it appears that the function is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the even integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The input list remains unchanged. The function handles empty lists as input, returning an empty list in such cases. It also correctly handles lists containing a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers, including edge cases where the list contains only even or only odd integers, or a single integer. The output list will always contain integers, and will be empty if the input list contains only even integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
