The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon evaluating the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with this assessment. The function `func_1` correctly filters out the even numbers from the input list and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. The condition `num % 2!= 0` correctly checks if a number is odd, and the list comprehension ensures that the original list remains unchanged.

The output hints confirm that the function handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists containing only even or only odd integers, and lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers. The hints also state that the output list will always contain integers and will be empty if the input list contains only even integers, which aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations, the original assessment, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description, and the output hints support the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
