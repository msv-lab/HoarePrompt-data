Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to filter out even numbers from a given list of integers, returning a new list that contains only the odd integers. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`), which is the condition for a number to be odd. If the number is odd, it is included in the new list.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:
- Lists containing a mix of positive and negative integers.
- Lists containing only even or only odd integers.
- Lists with a single integer.
- Empty lists, which result in an empty list being returned.
- The function does not modify the original list, as required.

The provided assertions and output hints support the correctness of the function, demonstrating its ability to filter odd numbers from lists with different compositions. Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, and the absence of any identified edge cases that the function does not handle, it can be concluded that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.
