To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers. The code provided uses a list comprehension to filter the integers in `nums` and return a new list that includes only the integers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`).

Given this information, the code will iterate through each integer `num` in the list `nums`. For each `num`, it checks whether the remainder when `num` is divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If this condition is true, it means `num` is an odd integer, and it will be included in the new list. If the condition is false (meaning `num` is even), it will not be included in the new list.

Therefore, the output of the program will be a list of odd integers from the original list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of odd integers from the original list `nums`.**
