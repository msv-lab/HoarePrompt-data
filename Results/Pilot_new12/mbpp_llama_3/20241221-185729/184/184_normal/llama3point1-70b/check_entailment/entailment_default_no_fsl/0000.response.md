Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only the numbers for which `num % 2!= 0`, which is the condition for a number to be odd.

The output hints suggest that the function handles various edge cases correctly, including empty lists, lists with only even integers, and lists with a mix of odd and even integers. The function's behavior aligns with the problem description, filtering out even numbers and returning a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list, without modifying the original list.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the function is designed to handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. There are no apparent cases where the function would not work as expected based on the provided information. Therefore, the code correctly implements the function to filter odd numbers as per the problem description.
