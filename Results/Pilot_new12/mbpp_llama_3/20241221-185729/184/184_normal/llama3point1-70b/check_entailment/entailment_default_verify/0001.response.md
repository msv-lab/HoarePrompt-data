The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a given list of numbers. However, upon closer inspection of the problem description and the provided code, it becomes apparent that there is a discrepancy. The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, but the code actually implements a function to filter out even numbers, returning a list of odd numbers.

The output hints further support this interpretation, stating that the function "filters out the even integers" and returns a list of "only the odd integers." This is consistent with the code's behavior but contradicts the problem description's request to filter odd numbers.

Given this information, the original assessment is not accurate because it claims the function correctly filters out odd numbers, whereas the function actually filters out even numbers. The correct interpretation is that the function does not meet the problem description as stated but does implement a correct filter for even numbers, which is opposite of what was requested.

Considering the problem description and the code's actual behavior, the final assessment of the program's correctness, in relation to the stated problem, should reflect that it does not meet the specified requirements.

Final: **False**
