Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements a function to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. Here's why it always meets the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.

2. **List Comprehension**: It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `nums`. The condition `num % 2!= 0` checks if a number is odd (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0). Only numbers that satisfy this condition are included in the output list.

3. **Handling of Input**: Given the assumption that the input will always be a valid list of integers, the function will work correctly for all such inputs. It does not require any error handling for cases like empty lists, non-integer values, or non-list inputs, as these are excluded by the problem's assumptions.

4. **Output**: The function returns a list of odd integers from the original list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description and the assumptions about the input. It will correctly filter odd numbers from any list of integers provided as input.
