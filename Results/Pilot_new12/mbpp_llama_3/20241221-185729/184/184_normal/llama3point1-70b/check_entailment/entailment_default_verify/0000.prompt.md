You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list `nums`. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number `num` in the list and checks if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is true, it means the number is odd, and it is included in the resulting list.

This function correctly implements the problem description for every potential case:

- It correctly identifies odd numbers by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0.
- It handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to filter.
- It handles the case where the input list contains only even numbers by returning an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to filter.
- It handles the case where the input list contains a mix of odd and even numbers by returning a list that includes only the odd numbers.
- It handles the case where the input list contains negative numbers, as the modulo operation (`%`) in Python works correctly with negative numbers.

Since the function behaves as expected in all these scenarios and no potential case where the program does not work as described can be identified, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the even integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The original list remains unchanged. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains only even integers, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains a mix of odd and even integers, the function will return a list containing only the odd integers. The function handles all potential edge cases, including lists with zero, one, or multiple elements, and lists containing only odd or only even integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
