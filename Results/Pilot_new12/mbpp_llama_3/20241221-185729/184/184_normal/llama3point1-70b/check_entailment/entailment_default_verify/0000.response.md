The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly filters odd numbers from a given list. Upon reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it appears that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.

The output hints confirm that the function handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists with only even integers, lists with a mix of odd and even integers, and lists with zero, one, or multiple elements. The function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list, leaving the original list unchanged.

The provided code accurately implements the problem description. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2!= 0]` correctly identifies odd numbers by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0. This logic is sound and aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations, the original assessment, the output hints, and the code itself, it is clear that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the function's behavior in various scenarios and confirms that the function handles all potential edge cases as expected. The output hints support this assessment by providing a summary of the code's functionality, which aligns with the problem description.

Final: **True**.
