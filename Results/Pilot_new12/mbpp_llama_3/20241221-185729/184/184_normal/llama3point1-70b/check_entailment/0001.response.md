Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The list comprehension iterates over each number `num` in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, which is the definition of an odd number.

This function works correctly for all possible inputs, including:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns `[]`, which is the expected result.
- Lists containing only even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` returns `[]`, as expected.
- Lists containing only odd numbers: `func_1([1, 3, 5])` returns `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists containing a mix of even and odd numbers: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists containing negative numbers and zero: `func_1([-1, 0, 1, -2, 2])` returns `[-1, 1]`, which correctly identifies the odd numbers.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct.
