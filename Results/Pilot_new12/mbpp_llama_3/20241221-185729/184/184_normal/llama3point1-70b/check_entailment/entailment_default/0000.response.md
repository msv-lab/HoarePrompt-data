Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that filters odd numbers from a given list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is equivalent to checking if a number is odd. 

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function filters out even integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The hints also mention that the function handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with only even integers, lists with only odd integers, and lists with a mix of odd and even integers.

Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the problem description. The code handles all potential cases, including lists with zero, one, or multiple elements, and lists containing only odd or only even integers. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to explicitly handle cases such as non-list inputs or non-integer values.

Therefore, the code seems to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
