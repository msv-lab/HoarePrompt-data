Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list `nums`. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number `num` in the list and checks if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (`num % 2!= 0`). If this condition is true, it means the number is odd, and it is included in the resulting list.

This function correctly implements the problem description for every potential case:

- It correctly identifies odd numbers by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0.
- It handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to filter.
- It handles the case where the input list contains only even numbers by returning an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to filter.
- It handles the case where the input list contains a mix of odd and even numbers by returning a list that includes only the odd numbers.
- It handles the case where the input list contains negative numbers, as the modulo operation (`%`) in Python works correctly with negative numbers.

Since the function behaves as expected in all these scenarios and no potential case where the program does not work as described can be identified, the program is considered correct.
