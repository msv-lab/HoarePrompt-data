Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It filters out the even integers from the input list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. The program handles all potential cases, including:

1. Empty list: The function returns an empty list, as expected.
2. List with only even integers: The function returns an empty list, as expected.
3. List with only odd integers: The function returns the original list, as expected.
4. List with a mix of odd and even integers: The function returns a list containing only the odd integers, as expected.

The program uses a list comprehension to filter out the even integers, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this. The condition `num % 2!= 0` correctly identifies odd integers, as a number is odd if and only if its remainder when divided by 2 is not equal to 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description, and it does so in a concise and efficient manner. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
