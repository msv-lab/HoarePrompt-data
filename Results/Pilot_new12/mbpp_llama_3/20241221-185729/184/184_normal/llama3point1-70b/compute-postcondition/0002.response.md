Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the even integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list. The original list remains unchanged. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains only even integers, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains a mix of odd and even integers, the function will return a list containing only the odd integers. The function handles all potential edge cases, including lists with zero, one, or multiple elements, and lists containing only odd or only even integers.**
