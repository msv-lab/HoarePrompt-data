The given code is a list comprehension that filters out even numbers from the list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. 

Given that `nums` is a list of integers, the program will return a list of integers as well. The integers in this returned list are odd numbers because the condition `num % 2!= 0` is applied to filter out the even numbers.

Output State: **The program returns a list of odd integers from the original list `nums`.**
