#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings of `s`, `word` is either undefined (if `words` is empty), the last word in `words` if no word met the condition for returning `True`, or the word that caused the function to return `True` because it contained 'z' in its middle characters and was longer than one character.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether any word in the string contains the character 'z' in its middle characters and has a length greater than 1. The function splits the input string into words and checks each word for the specified condition. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains only single-character words, or words without 'z' in their middle characters, by returning `False` in these cases. The state of the program after the function concludes is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) that indicates the presence or absence of a word with 'z' in its middle characters and a length greater than 1 in the input string.
