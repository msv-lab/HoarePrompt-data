Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if any word in the input string contains the character 'z' in its middle characters (i.e., not at the start or end of the word) and has a length greater than 1. The function correctly handles edge cases, such as empty strings, single-character words, and words without 'z' in their middle characters, by returning `False` in these cases.

The code splits the input string into words using the `split` method and then checks each word using a `for` loop. The condition `len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]` ensures that the word has a length greater than 1 and that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word. If a word meets this condition, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

Since the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or edge cases that the code does not handle, and the output hints agree with the code's behavior, the code is correct.
