You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1(s)` splits the input string `s` into words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the word, excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`).
4. If the condition is met, the function immediately returns `True`.
5. If the function iterates over all words and doesn't find any word with 'z' in the middle, it returns `False`.

The code correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* Single-character words: The condition `len(word) > 1` ensures that single-character words are ignored, as there is no "middle" to check for 'z'.
* Words with 'z' at the start or end: The slicing `word[1:-1]` excludes the first and last characters, so 'z' at the start or end of a word is not considered a match.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and no potential cases can be found where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings of `s`, `word` is either undefined (if `words` is empty), the last word in `words` if no word met the condition for returning `True`, or the word that caused the function to return `True` because it contained 'z' in its middle characters and was longer than one character.
    return False
    #The program returns False


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
