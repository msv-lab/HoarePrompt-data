The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. 

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word by splitting the input string into words, iterating over each word, and checking if the length is more than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters.

The output hints support the correctness of the program by describing its functionality accurately. The hints mention that the function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains only single-character words, or words without 'z' in their middle characters, by returning `False` in these cases.

Furthermore, the hints do not indicate any potential case where the program does not work according to the problem description. The hints also align with the problem description, stating that the function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether any word in the string contains the character 'z' in its middle characters and has a length greater than 1.

The program's behavior, as described in the output hints, matches the expected behavior based on the problem description and the provided code. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**.
