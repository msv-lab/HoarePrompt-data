You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program checks if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. The function splits the input string into words and then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if the length is more than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters.

The program handles all potential cases as follows:

- It correctly identifies words with 'z' in the middle.
- It ignores words with 'z' at the start and end or both.
- It handles single-character words.
- It handles empty strings by not splitting the string into words and thus not entering the loop, correctly returning False.

For example, for the input "Hello zebra fox" it will return True because 'zebra' has 'z' in the middle. For the input "zoo" it will return False because 'z' is at the start and end. 

Since we cannot find any potential case where the program does not work according to the problem description, the code is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether any word in the string contains the character 'z' in its middle characters and has a length greater than 1. The function splits the input string into words and checks each word for the specified condition. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains only single-character words, or words without 'z' in their middle characters, by returning `False` in these cases. The state of the program after the function concludes is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) that indicates the presence or absence of a word with 'z' in its middle characters and a length greater than 1 in the input string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
