Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1(s)` splits the input string `s` into words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the word, excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`).
4. If the condition is met, the function immediately returns `True`.
5. If the function iterates over all words and doesn't find any word with 'z' in the middle, it returns `False`.

The code correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* Single-character words: The condition `len(word) > 1` ensures that single-character words are ignored, as there is no "middle" to check for 'z'.
* Words with 'z' at the start or end: The slicing `word[1:-1]` excludes the first and last characters, so 'z' at the start or end of a word is not considered a match.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and no potential cases can be found where the program does not work as expected.
