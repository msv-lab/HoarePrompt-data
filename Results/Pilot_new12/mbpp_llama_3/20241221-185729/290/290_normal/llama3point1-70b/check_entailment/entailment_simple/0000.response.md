Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into a list of words using the `split` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list.
3. For each word, it checks two conditions:
   - The word must have more than one character (`len(word) > 1`).
   - The word must contain 'z' in its middle characters (`'z' in word[1:-1]`).
4. If both conditions are met, the function immediately returns `True`.
5. If the function iterates over all words and doesn't find any word that meets the conditions, it returns `False`.

The program correctly checks if any word in the input string contains 'z' in its middle characters (i.e., not at the start or end of the word), and only considers words with more than one character. This matches the problem description, so the program is correct.

For example, given the input string `"Hello buzz world"`, the function will return `True` because the word "buzz" contains 'z' in its middle characters. On the other hand, given the input string `"zoo"`, the function will return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the word.
