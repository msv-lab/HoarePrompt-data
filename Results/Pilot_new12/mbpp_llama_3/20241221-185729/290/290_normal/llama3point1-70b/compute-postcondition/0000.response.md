The code `words = s.split()` splits the string `s` into a list of words, using whitespace as the delimiter. 

The `split()` function without any arguments splits the string at each whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines) and returns a list of the resulting substrings.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings of `s`, where each substring is a word from `s` separated by whitespace**
