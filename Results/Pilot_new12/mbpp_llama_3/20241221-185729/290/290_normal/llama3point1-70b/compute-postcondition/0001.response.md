According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string and `words` is a list of substrings of `s`. For the loop to execute, `words` must have at least 1 word. Since `word` is the loop variable, at the start of the loop, it should be the first word in the `words` list.

State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of substrings of `s` that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the `words` list**
