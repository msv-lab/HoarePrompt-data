Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether any word in the string contains the character 'z' in its middle characters and has a length greater than 1. The function splits the input string into words and checks each word for the specified condition. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains only single-character words, or words without 'z' in their middle characters, by returning `False` in these cases. The state of the program after the function concludes is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) that indicates the presence or absence of a word with 'z' in its middle characters and a length greater than 1 in the input string.**
