Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks if a given string `s` contains the character 'z' at any position except at the start and end of the word. The function uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string and then checks if 'z' is present in the resulting substring.

The function works as expected for the provided test cases:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is found in the middle of the string.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not found in the string at all, including in the middle.

The function correctly handles the edge cases, including:

- Empty strings: `func_1('')` would return `False` because there's no 'z' in an empty string, and `s[1:-1]` would raise no errors since it results in an empty string.
- Strings with 'z' only at the start or end: These cases are correctly handled by excluding the first and last characters.
- Strings without 'z': These are correctly identified as not containing 'z' in the middle.

Given the logic and implementation of `func_1`, it accurately fulfills the problem description for all potential cases that can be considered. Therefore, no example can be found where the program does not work as expected, indicating the program is correct.
