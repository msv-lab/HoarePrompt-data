Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

Here's why it's correct:

- The function uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string.
- It then checks if 'z' is present in the resulting substring using the `in` operator.
- If 'z' is found, the function immediately returns `True`.
- If 'z' is not found, the function returns `False` after the `if` block.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as empty strings, strings with a length of 1 or 2, and strings where 'z' is only present at the start or end. In all these cases, the function will return `False` because 'z' is not present in the substring excluding the first and last characters.

For example, consider the following test cases:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is only present at the start.
- `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the substring.

Overall, the program does what the problem description asks for, and it does so for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
