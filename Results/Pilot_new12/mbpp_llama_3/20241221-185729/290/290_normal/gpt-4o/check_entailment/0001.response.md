Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks if a string contains 'z' anywhere except at the start and end of the word. It uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string and then checks if 'z' is present in the remaining part of the string.

The function seems to be correct and works as expected for all potential cases. It handles strings with 'z' in the middle, strings without 'z', and edge cases where the string is empty or only contains one or two characters.

Here's why it works correctly:

- The function `func_1` checks for 'z' in `s[1:-1]`, which effectively excludes the first and last characters of the string. This directly addresses the requirement of finding 'z' except at the start and end of the word.
- If 'z' is found in the specified part of the string, the function immediately returns `True`.
- If 'z' is not found in the specified part of the string, the function returns `False`, which correctly handles cases where 'z' is not present in the middle of the string or is only present at the start or end.

Given the problem description and the provided unit tests, the function appears to behave as expected without any apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
