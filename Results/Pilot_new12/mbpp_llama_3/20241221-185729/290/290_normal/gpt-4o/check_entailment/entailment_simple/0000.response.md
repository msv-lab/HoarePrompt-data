Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function checks if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. It uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string and then checks if 'z' is present in the remaining substring using the `in` operator.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The problem description states that the function should check if 'z' is present in the string, except at the start and end. The program achieves this by using `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string.
2. The `in` operator is used to check if 'z' is present in the substring. If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`.
3. If 'z' is not found in the substring, the function returns `False`.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the program behaves as expected:

* `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the string, but not at the start or end.
* `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is present at the start of the string.
* `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the string at all.

Overall, the program correctly implements the desired functionality, and its behavior aligns with the problem description.
