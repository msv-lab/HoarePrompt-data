Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. It correctly handles edge cases such as empty strings, strings with a length of 1 or 2, and strings where 'z' is only present at the start or end. 

The function `func_1` uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the input string `s`. It then checks if 'z' is present in the resulting substring using the `in` operator. If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) agree with the problem description and the code's functionality. The function behaves as expected for different input scenarios, confirming that it meets the requirements.

Since the code handles all potential cases correctly according to the given problem description and there are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle, the program is considered correct.
