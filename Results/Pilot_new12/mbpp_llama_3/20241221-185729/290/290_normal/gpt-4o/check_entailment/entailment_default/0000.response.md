Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The line `if 'z' in s[1:-1]:` does exactly this, and the function returns `True` if 'z' is found and `False` otherwise. 

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` and `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`, also confirm that the function behaves as expected. The function handles edge cases, such as strings with a length of 1 or 2, or empty strings, correctly by returning `False` for these cases.

The output hints agree with the code and help to confirm that the code is correct. The hints mention that the function returns `True` if 'z' is found in the substring excluding the first and last characters, and `False` otherwise, which is exactly what the code implements. 

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
