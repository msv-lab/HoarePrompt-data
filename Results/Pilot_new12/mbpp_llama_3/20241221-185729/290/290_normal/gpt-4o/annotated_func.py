#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns a boolean value True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and 'z' is not present in the substring of s excluding the first and last characters
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The function returns `True` if 'z' is found in the specified substring, and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as empty strings, strings with a length of 1 or 2, and strings where 'z' is only present at the start or end, in which cases the function will also return `False` because the condition checks 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last characters. The function does not modify the input string `s`.
