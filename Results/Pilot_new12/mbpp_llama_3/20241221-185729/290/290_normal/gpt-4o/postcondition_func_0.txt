The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The function returns `True` if 'z' is found in the specified substring, and `False` otherwise. This includes handling edge cases such as empty strings, strings with a length of 1 or 2, and strings where 'z' is only present at the start or end, in which cases the function will also return `False` because the condition checks 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last characters. The function does not modify the input string `s`.
