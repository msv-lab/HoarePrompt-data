Correctness: **False**.

The given program is supposed to check whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number in which each digit is either greater than or lesser than its adjacent digits, i.e., the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. However, the given program will return True for numbers that do not satisfy this condition.

For example, if we input the number 1321, the program will return True, but 1321 is not an undulating number. An undulating number would be 121 or 212.

The reason for this mistake is that the program checks if a digit is less than its next digit and greater than its previous digit, or vice versa, but it does not verify that this condition holds true for the entire number. It simply checks each digit individually and if it finds a digit that does not satisfy the condition, it returns False.

However, the condition should hold true for the entire number. For example, the number 1212 is not undulating because the digits do not alternate between increasing and decreasing.

A correct implementation would involve checking the differences between consecutive digits and verifying that they alternate between positive and negative. 

One potential case that this program does not handle correctly is the case where the number has less than 3 digits. In such cases, the program will return True because the loop does not execute, but the number may or may not be undulating depending on the definition. 

In order to fix this issue, we would need to modify the program to check these edge cases separately. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False  # or return True, depending on the definition of an undulating number
    undulating = True
    increasing = None
    for i in range(1, len(n)):
        if n[i] > n[i - 1]:
            if increasing is False:
                undulating = False
                break
            increasing = True
        elif n[i] < n[i - 1]:
            if increasing is True:
                undulating = False
                break
            increasing = False
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```
