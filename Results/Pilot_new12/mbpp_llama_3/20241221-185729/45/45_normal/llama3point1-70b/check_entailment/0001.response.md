Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a number is undulating. An undulating number is a number in which each digit alternates between increasing and decreasing. 

The issue with the given code is that it does not correctly handle the case when the number has a length of less than 3. For example, if we pass the number 12 or 21 to the function, it will return True, which is incorrect because a number with a length of 2 cannot be undulating.

Another issue with the given code is that it does not correctly handle the case when the number has consecutive equal digits. For example, if we pass the number 121 to the function, it will return False, which is correct. However, if we pass the number 111, it will return True, which is also incorrect because a number with consecutive equal digits is not undulating.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the code to correctly handle these cases. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if (n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]) or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

In this updated code, we first check if the length of the number is less than 3. If it is, we immediately return False. Then we iterate through the digits of the number, checking if each digit alternates between increasing and decreasing. If we find a digit that does not alternate, we set undulating to False and break out of the loop. Finally, we return the value of undulating.
