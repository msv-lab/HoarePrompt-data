The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the states of the variables `n`, `i`, and `undulating` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a string of at least length 3 representing an integer, `i` is 1, `undulating` is `False`, and it is not the case that (the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `n`, or the character at index `i-1` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i+1` in `n`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
