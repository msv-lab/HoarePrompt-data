Postcondition: ***`n` is a string of at least length 3 representing an integer, `i` is 1, and either `undulating` is `True` if the current value of the characters in `n` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are such that either the character at `i-1` is less than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is less than the character at `i+1`, or the character at `i-1` is greater than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is greater than the character at `i+1`, or `undulating` is `False` if it is not the case that (the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `n`, or the character at index `i-1` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i+1` in `n`), and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
