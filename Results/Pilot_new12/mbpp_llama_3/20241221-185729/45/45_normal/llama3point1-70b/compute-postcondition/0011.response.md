To solve this, let's consider the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `n` is a string of at least length 4 representing an integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `undulating` is `True` if the current value of the characters in `n` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are such that either the character at `i-1` is less than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is less than the character at `i+1`, or the character at `i-1` is greater than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is greater than the character at `i+1`. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.

Given Code:
```python
undulating = False
```

This code directly sets the value of `undulating` to `False`, regardless of the previous conditions or the values of `n` and `i`.

Therefore, after executing this code:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a string of at least length 4 representing an integer.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2.
- The value of `undulating` is now `False`, as directly set by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a string of at least length 4 representing an integer, `i` is 2, and `undulating` is `False`.**
