Postcondition: ***`n` is a string of at least length 4 representing an integer, `i` is 2. If the characters at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in `n` are such that either the character at `i-1` is less than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is less than the character at `i+1`, or the character at `i-1` is greater than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is greater than the character at `i+1`, then `undulating` is `True`. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
