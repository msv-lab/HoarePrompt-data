Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` as input, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits in the string are in an undulating pattern, where each digit is either less than or greater than its neighboring digits. It returns `True` if the digits are in an undulating pattern and `False` otherwise. The function handles all positive integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the digits are in an undulating pattern or not. The function's output is solely dependent on the input integer `n` and does not modify the input in any way. The function also handles single-digit integers and integers with two digits, returning `True` for single-digit integers and `True` or `False` for two-digit integers based on the comparison of the two digits.**
