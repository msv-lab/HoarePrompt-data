The code sets `undulating` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` is still a string of at least length 5 representing an integer, and `i` is still 3.

Output State: **`n` is a string of at least length 5 representing an integer, `i` is 3, `undulating` is False**
