The value of `undulating` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string of at least length 3 representing an integer, `i` is 1, and `undulating` is `False`, and it is not the case that (the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `n`, or the character at index `i-1` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i+1` in `n`).

Output State: **`n` is a string of at least length 3 representing an integer, `i` is 1, `undulating` is `False`, and it is not the case that (the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `n`, or the character at index `i-1` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i` in `n` and the character at index `i` in `n` is greater than the character at index `i+1` in `n`)**
