Postcondition: **`n` is a string of at least length 3 representing an integer, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is used to compare characters in `n` such that the character at index `i-1` and the character at index `i` and the character at index `i+1` have a specific relationship. `undulating` is `True`. The current value of the characters in `n` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are such that either the character at `i-1` is less than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is less than the character at `i+1`, or the character at `i-1` is greater than the character at `i` and the character at `i` is greater than the character at `i+1`.**
