The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

The states of `n`, `i`, and `undulating` are not affected. Therefore, `n` remains a string of at least length 5 representing an integer, `i` remains 3, and `undulating` remains False.

Output State: **`n` is a string of at least length 5 representing an integer, `i` is 3, `undulating` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
