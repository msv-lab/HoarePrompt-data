Postcondition: **`n` is a string of at least length 5 representing an integer, `i` is 3. If the digits at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in `n` are either in ascending or descending order, then `undulating` can be either True or False. Otherwise, `undulating` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
