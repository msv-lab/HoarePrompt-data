Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to check whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where the digits alternate between two values. The provided function `func_1` checks this condition.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The function first converts the input number `n` into a string `s`. This allows for easier manipulation of the digits.
2. It checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `False`, because an undulating number must have at least 3 digits to alternate between two values.
3. The function then checks if the first two digits of the number are the same. If they are, the function returns `False`, because an undulating number must start with two different digits to alternate between them.
4. The function then enters a loop that checks each digit in the string `s` starting from the third digit (index 2).
5. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current index `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it checks if the current digit is equal to the first digit `first_digit`. If `i` is odd, it checks if the current digit is equal to the second digit `second_digit`. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns `False`.
6. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

Based on the provided assertions, the function seems to work as expected:

- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True`, because the digits alternate between 1 and 2.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False`, because the digits do not alternate between two values.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True`, because the digits alternate between 1 and 2.

After analyzing the program's logic and the provided assertions, it appears that the function correctly checks whether a given number is undulating or not. I couldn't find any cases where the function does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
