Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks if the string representation of a given positive integer `n` has a length of at least 3 and alternates between the first two digits starting from the first character. This matches the problem description of an undulating number, where the digits alternate between two values. 

The provided unit tests also support this, with `func_1(1212121)` and `func_1(121)` returning `True` (as they are undulating) and `func_1(1991)` returning `False` (as it is not undulating). 

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the first two digits are the same (returning `False`), the string length is less than 3 (returning `False`), or the alternation pattern is broken at any point (returning `False`). 

The output hints agree with the code, confirming that it checks for a string representation of a given positive integer `n` with a length of at least 3 and alternates between the first two digits. 

Since we can't find any example where the program does not work as expected in the description, and all the examples given work correctly, the code is correct.
