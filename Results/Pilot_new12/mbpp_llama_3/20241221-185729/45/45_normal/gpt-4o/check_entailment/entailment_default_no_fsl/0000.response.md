Correctness: **True**

The code checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number whose digits alternate between two values. The code correctly implements this by first checking if the length of the number is less than 3 (in which case it's not undulating), then checking if the first two digits are the same (in which case it's not undulating), and finally checking if the rest of the digits alternate between the first two digits. 

The code handles all edge cases, including numbers with less than 3 digits, numbers whose first two digits are the same, and numbers whose digits do not alternate. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the code. 

For example, the function `func_1` correctly returns `True` for the number 1212121, which is an undulating number, and `False` for the number 1991, which is not an undulating number. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description, and there are no obvious cases where it would not work as expected. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
