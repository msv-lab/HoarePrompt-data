Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 4, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 3. If `i` is odd and the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to `second_digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, if `i` is even and the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to `first_digit`, the program returns False. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made.***
