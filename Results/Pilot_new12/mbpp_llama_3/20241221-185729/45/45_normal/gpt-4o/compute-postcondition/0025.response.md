Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 5, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4. If `i` is odd and the fifth digit of `s` is not equal to the `second_digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made, implying that either `i` is even or the fifth digit of `s` is equal to the `second_digit`, and the program's state remains unchanged, with `i` still being 4 and `s` being the string representation of `n`.**
