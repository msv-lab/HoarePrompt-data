The program returns False. Since `i` is 3, which is odd, the condition that `i` is even is not met. However, this does not affect the return value because the code explicitly states `return False`. The value of `n`, `s`, `first_digit`, `second_digit` does not impact the return value in this case.

Output State: **The program returns False**
