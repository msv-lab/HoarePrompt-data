Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, and either `i` is not divisible by 2 or `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`. Since `i` is given as 2, which is divisible by 2, it simplifies to `s[2]` being equal to `first_digit`.**
