Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, `i` is divisible by 2, and `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`. Additionally, either `i` is divisible by 2 or `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit` is not true, which simplifies to `i` is divisible by 2 and `s[i]` is equal to `second_digit` since `i` is 2 and thus divisible by 2. Therefore, it simplifies further to `s[2]` being equal to `second_digit`.**
