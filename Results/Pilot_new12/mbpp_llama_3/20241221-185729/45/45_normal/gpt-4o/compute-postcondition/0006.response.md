Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, and `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, which equals `s[1]`. The current value of `first_digit` is equal to the current value of `second_digit`.**
