The code `s = str(n)` converts the integer `n` to a string and assigns it to the variable `s`. The value of `n` is still a positive integer, and a new variable `s` is introduced, which is equal to the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n`**
