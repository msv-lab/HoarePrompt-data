Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 5, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4, if `i` is even and the fifth digit of `s` is not equal to the first digit, the program returns False, otherwise, no changes are made**
