    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string equal to the string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` as a string, and `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a string, which equals `s[1]`. The first digit of `n` is not equal to the second digit of `n`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer with a string representation `s` that alternates between `first_digit` and `second_digit` starting from the first and second characters respectively, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `s` is the string representation of `n`, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the string representation of a given positive integer `n` has a length of at least 3 and alternates between the first two digits starting from the first character. It returns `True` if the string representation meets these conditions and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases where the first two digits are the same, the string length is less than 3, or the alternation pattern is broken at any point. The input integer `n` remains unchanged throughout the function execution, and the output is a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `n` satisfies the specified conditions.
