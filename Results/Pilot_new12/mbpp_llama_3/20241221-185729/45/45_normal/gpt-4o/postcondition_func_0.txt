The function `func_1` checks if the string representation of a given positive integer `n` has a length of at least 3 and alternates between the first two digits starting from the first character. It returns `True` if the string representation meets these conditions and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases where the first two digits are the same, the string length is less than 3, or the alternation pattern is broken at any point. The input integer `n` remains unchanged throughout the function execution, and the output is a boolean value indicating whether the string representation of `n` satisfies the specified conditions.
