To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code iterates over the string `s` and selects characters at even indices (0-based indexing). It then joins these selected characters into a new string.

Given that `s` is a string, the code will return a new string that consists of characters from `s` that are at even positions (0, 2, 4,...).

Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices (0-based indexing).**
