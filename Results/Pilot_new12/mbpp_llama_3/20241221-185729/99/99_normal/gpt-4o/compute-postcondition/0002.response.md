Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices (0-based indexing), effectively filtering out characters at odd indices. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and returns an empty string in such cases. The original string `s` remains unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a string. If the input is not a string, the function may raise an error. The function does not handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.**
