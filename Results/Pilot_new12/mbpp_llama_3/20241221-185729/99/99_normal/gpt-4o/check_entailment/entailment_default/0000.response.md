Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly removes the characters which have odd index values of a given string. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s` and selects only the characters at even indices (i.e., where `i % 2 == 0`). This is in line with the problem description. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for different input strings.

The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and returns an empty string in such cases. The original string `s` remains unchanged. Although the function does not perform any error checking on the input type, we assume that the input will always be a string, as stated in the problem description.

The output hints agree with the code and describe the function's behavior accurately. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for every potential case.
