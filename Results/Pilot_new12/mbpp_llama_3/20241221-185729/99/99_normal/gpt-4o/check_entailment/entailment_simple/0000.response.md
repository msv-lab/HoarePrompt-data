The function `func_1` is designed to remove characters with odd index values from a given string. In Python, indexing is 0-based, which means the first character of a string is at index 0 (even) and the second character is at index 1 (odd). 

The given function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string `s`, selecting characters at indices `i` where `i % 2 == 0`, which corresponds to even indices. It then uses `''.join()` to concatenate these selected characters into a new string, effectively removing characters at odd indices.

Given the problem description and the provided function, the function indeed meets the requirements. It correctly identifies and removes characters at odd indices (1-based indexing, or simply put, every other character starting from the second one in a 0-based indexing system) from the input string `s`. The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) further validate this behavior for different strings.

Therefore, the function works as intended according to the problem description, assuming that "odd index values" refers to indices being odd in a 0-based indexing system, which is the standard in Python.

Correctness: **True**
