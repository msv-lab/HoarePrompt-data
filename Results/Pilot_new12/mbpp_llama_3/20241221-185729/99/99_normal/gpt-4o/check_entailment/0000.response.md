Correctness: **True**.

I believe the code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description, which is to remove the characters at odd index values from a given string. 

In Python, indexing starts at 0, which means that the even indices are 0, 2, 4, and so on. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string and select only the characters at even indices (`i % 2 == 0`).

For example, given the string 'abcdef', the indices and corresponding characters are:
- 0: 'a' (even index)
- 1: 'b' (odd index)
- 2: 'c' (even index)
- 3: 'd' (odd index)
- 4: 'e' (even index)
- 5: 'f' (odd index)

The code correctly selects the characters at even indices ('a', 'c', 'e') and returns the string 'ace', which matches the expected output.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input strings. Since I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
