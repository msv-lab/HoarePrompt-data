Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It filters out characters at odd indices from the input string `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices. 

The list comprehension `[s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0]` generates a list of characters from `s` where the index `i` is even (0-based indexing). The `join` method then concatenates these characters into a single string, which is returned by the function.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and returns the correct result in each case.

Since we assume that the input will always be a valid string, the lack of error checking in the function does not affect its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
