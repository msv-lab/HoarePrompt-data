Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from a given string `s`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the string, but only includes characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in the new string. 

This is achieved by using `range(0, len(s), 2)` which generates indices starting from 0 and incrementing by 2, effectively selecting characters at even indices.

The function also handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and returns an empty string in such cases.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality. They mention that the function returns a new string containing characters from the even indices of `s`, and that it handles strings of any length, including empty strings.

Since the program description does not specify any error checking or handling for non-string inputs, and we assume that the input will always be valid, the program is considered correct. 

Therefore, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case, assuming valid input.
