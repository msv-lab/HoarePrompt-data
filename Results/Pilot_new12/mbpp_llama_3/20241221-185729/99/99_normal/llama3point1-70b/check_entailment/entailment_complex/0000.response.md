To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's break down the requirements and compare them with the functionality of the provided code.

The problem description asks for a function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string. In Python, indexing is 0-based, meaning the first character of a string is at index 0 (even), the second character is at index 1 (odd), and so on.

The provided function `func_1(s)` uses a generator expression within `''.join()` to iterate over the characters of the string `s`. Specifically, it iterates over the indices `i` of `s` where `i` ranges from 0 to the length of `s` with a step of 2. This means it selects characters at indices 0, 2, 4, and so on, effectively selecting characters at even indices.

By only including characters from even indices in the new string, the function is essentially removing characters at odd indices, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Given this analysis, the function behaves as specified in the problem description for all potential valid inputs (assuming, as per the instructions, that the input will always be a string and not cause any errors). It correctly returns a new string containing characters from the even indices of the input string `s`, leaving the original string unchanged.

Correctness: **True**
