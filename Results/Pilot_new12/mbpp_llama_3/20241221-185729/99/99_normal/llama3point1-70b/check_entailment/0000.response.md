Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string `s`. This is because Python uses zero-based indexing, where the first character is at index 0 (even) and the second character is at index 1 (odd). The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the string, starting from index 0 and incrementing by 2 each time (`range(0, len(s), 2)`), which effectively selects only the characters at even index values.

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the function will return "ace", which are the characters at even index values (0, 2, and 4). This matches the problem description, and the function works correctly for all possible input strings. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
