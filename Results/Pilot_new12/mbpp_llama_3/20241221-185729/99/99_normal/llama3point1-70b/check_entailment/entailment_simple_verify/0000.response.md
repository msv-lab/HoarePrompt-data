Based on the provided problem description, original assessment, and annotated code, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

The problem description asks for a Python function to remove characters at odd index values from a given string. The original assessment claims that the provided function `func_1(s)` correctly achieves this by using a generator expression to iterate over the string, starting from index 0 and incrementing by 2 each time (`range(0, len(s), 2)`), effectively selecting only the characters at even index values.

The annotated code confirms this behavior, stating that the program returns a string consisting of characters at even indices from the original string `s`. This aligns with the problem description, as removing characters at odd indices is equivalent to selecting characters at even indices.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly explains the function's behavior and how it meets the problem description. The annotated code provides additional evidence to support this assessment, as it clearly describes the program's state and behavior.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and based on the provided information, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
