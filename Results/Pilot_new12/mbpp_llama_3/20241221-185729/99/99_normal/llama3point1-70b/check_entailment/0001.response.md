Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to be correct. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where all characters at odd index positions are removed. 

The expression `s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)` generates a sequence of characters from the input string `s`, but only includes characters at even index positions (0, 2, 4,...). The `''.join(...)` expression then concatenates these characters into a single string, effectively removing the characters at odd index positions.

This solution correctly handles strings of any length and content, including empty strings. It does not perform any error checking on the input, but as long as the input is a string, it will produce the expected output.

For example, given the input string `"abcdefgh"`, the function will return `"aceg"`, which is the expected result of removing the characters at odd index positions. 

Since the function behaves as expected for all inputs, including empty strings and strings with an odd or even number of characters, and since no edge cases have been found where the function does not produce the expected output, the program can be considered correct.
