Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string. 

In Python, indices are 0-based, meaning they start at 0. Therefore, even indices are 0, 2, 4, and so on, while odd indices are 1, 3, 5, etc. The given function `func_1` uses a generator expression to iterate over the string `s` with a step size of 2, effectively selecting only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4,...).

Here is how it works:

- The `range(0, len(s), 2)` generates numbers from 0 to the length of the string `s` with a step size of 2.
- The expression `s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)` iterates over these even indices, selecting the corresponding characters from the string.
- The `''.join(...)` combines these characters back into a string.

For example, given the string "abcdef", the function will return "ace" because 'a' is at index 0 (even), 'c' is at index 2 (even), and 'e' is at index 4 (even). The characters 'b', 'd', and 'f' are at odd indices (1, 3, 5) and are thus excluded.

Therefore, the function correctly removes the characters which have odd index values of a given string, as specified in the problem description.
