The original assessment states that the program is correct, with a correctness of **True**. This assessment is based on the understanding that the Python function `func_1(s)` correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string `s` by using a generator expression to iterate over the string, starting from index 0 and incrementing by 2 each time.

Upon reviewing the provided code and output hints, it appears that the original assessment is indeed accurate. The function `func_1(s)` uses zero-based indexing and correctly selects only the characters at even index values by using `range(0, len(s), 2)`. This means that characters at indices 0, 2, 4, and so on, are included in the returned string, effectively removing characters at odd indices.

The output hints support this correctness, stating that the function returns a new string containing characters from the even indices of `s`, handles strings of any length (including empty strings), and leaves the original string `s` unchanged. The hints also mention that the function does not perform error checking on the input, but this does not affect the correctness of the program given the assumption that the input will always be a string.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of **True** is maintained because the function correctly achieves its intended purpose of removing characters at odd index values from a string.

Final: **True**
