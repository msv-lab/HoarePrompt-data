Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string containing characters from the even indices of `s`. The returned string includes characters at indices 0, 2, 4, and so on, up to the second last character if the length of `s` is odd, and the last character if the length of `s` is even. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings, in which case it returns an empty string. The original string `s` remains unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will always be a string. If the input is not a string, the function may throw an error.**
