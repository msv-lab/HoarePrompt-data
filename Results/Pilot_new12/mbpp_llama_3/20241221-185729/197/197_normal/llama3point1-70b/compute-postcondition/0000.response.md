To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code `return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` iterates over each element in `lst` (which is a list) and counts how many times each of these elements appears in `tup` (which is a tuple). It then sums up all these counts.

Given that `tup` is a tuple and `lst` is a list, the code returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` of all elements present in `lst`. 

Output State: **The program returns the total count of occurrences in tuple `tup` of all elements present in list `lst`**
