Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as parameters and returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` of all elements present in `lst`. The function effectively counts each occurrence of every element from `lst` that exists in `tup`, regardless of the order or frequency of elements in either the tuple or the list. It handles cases where elements in `lst` may not exist in `tup`, in which case they are simply not counted. The function also implicitly handles scenarios where `lst` or `tup` might be empty, returning 0 in such cases since there would be nothing to count. Additionally, if there are duplicate elements in `lst`, each of them is counted separately as long as they exist in `tup`. The final state of the program after execution is that the variables `tup` and `lst` remain unchanged, and an integer value representing the total count is returned.**
