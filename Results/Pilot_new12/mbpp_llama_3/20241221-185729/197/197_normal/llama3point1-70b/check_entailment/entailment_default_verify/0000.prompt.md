You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and counts its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method. The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total occurrence of all elements in the list.

Here's why I believe the function is correct:

- It handles cases where the list and tuple have common elements.
- It handles cases where the list and tuple have no common elements (in which case it returns 0).
- It handles cases where the list contains duplicate elements, counting each occurrence in the tuple correctly.
- It handles cases where the tuple contains duplicate elements, again counting each occurrence correctly.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3]`, the function correctly returns 3, because the element 2 occurs twice in the tuple and the element 3 occurs once. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, which suggests that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as parameters and returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` of all elements present in `lst`. The function effectively counts each occurrence of every element from `lst` that exists in `tup`, regardless of the order or frequency of elements in either the tuple or the list. It handles cases where elements in `lst` may not exist in `tup`, in which case they are simply not counted. The function also implicitly handles scenarios where `lst` or `tup` might be empty, returning 0 in such cases since there would be nothing to count. Additionally, if there are duplicate elements in `lst`, each of them is counted separately as long as they exist in `tup`. The final state of the program after execution is that the variables `tup` and `lst` remain unchanged, and an integer value representing the total count is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
