Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple. It utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple. The `sum` function then adds up these counts for each element in the list, effectively giving the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.

The function handles various scenarios, including:

- Elements in the list not existing in the tuple: They are simply not counted.
- Empty list or tuple: The function returns 0, as there are no elements to count.
- Duplicate elements in the list: Each of them is counted separately if they exist in the tuple.
- Order and frequency of elements in the tuple or the list: The function is unaffected by these, counting each occurrence as required.

Given that we assume valid input (i.e., the function will always receive a list and a tuple), the function operates as expected without handling invalid input cases such as non-list or non-tuple inputs. The output hints support the functionality of the code, outlining its behavior in various scenarios without indicating any discrepancies with the problem description. Therefore, based on the problem description and assuming valid inputs, the code accurately implements the required functionality.
