Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` appears to correctly count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. Here's why:

- The function takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).
- It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst`.
- For each element in `lst`, it counts the occurrences of that element in `tup` using the `count` method.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these counts, effectively giving the total count of all elements from `lst` that are found in `tup`.

This approach correctly handles the task as described in the problem statement. It does not matter if there are duplicate elements in `lst` because the `count` method will be called for each one, and `sum` will add up all the counts. If an element in `lst` is not found in `tup`, `count` will return 0, and this will not affect the total sum.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)` and `lst = [2, 4, 5]`, the function will correctly count the occurrences of 2 (twice) and 4 (once) in the tuple, and since 5 is not in the tuple, it will contribute 0 to the sum, resulting in a total count of 3.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including when the list or tuple is empty, or when there are no matches between the list and the tuple. Therefore, the provided function is correct according to the problem description.
