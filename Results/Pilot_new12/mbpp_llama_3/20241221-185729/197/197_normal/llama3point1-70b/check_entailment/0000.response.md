Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and counts its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method. The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total occurrence of all elements in the list.

Here's why I believe the function is correct:

- It handles cases where the list and tuple have common elements.
- It handles cases where the list and tuple have no common elements (in which case it returns 0).
- It handles cases where the list contains duplicate elements, counting each occurrence in the tuple correctly.
- It handles cases where the tuple contains duplicate elements, again counting each occurrence correctly.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3]`, the function correctly returns 3, because the element 2 occurs twice in the tuple and the element 3 occurs once. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, which suggests that the function is correct.
