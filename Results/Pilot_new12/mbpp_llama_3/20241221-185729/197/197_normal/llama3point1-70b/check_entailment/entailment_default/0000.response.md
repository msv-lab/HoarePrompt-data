Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code seems to correctly implement the function to count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple, effectively handling all potential cases as described in the problem description and output hints.

Here are the key points that support the correctness of the code:
1. **Handling of Non-Existing Elements**: If an element from the list does not exist in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` returns 0, which does not contribute to the sum, thus correctly handling cases where elements in the list may not be present in the tuple.
2. **Duplicate Elements in the List**: The code counts each occurrence of every element from the list that exists in the tuple separately. This means if there are duplicate elements in the list, and these elements also exist in the tuple, they will be counted as many times as they occur in the list.
3. **Empty List or Tuple**: If either the list or the tuple is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no elements to count, which aligns with the expected behavior.
4. **Order and Frequency**: The code is not sensitive to the order of elements in either the list or the tuple, nor does it require any specific frequency of elements for the counting to work correctly.

Given that the code handles all the described scenarios correctly and does not have any apparent logical flaws or omissions regarding the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the code works as expected for every potential case.
