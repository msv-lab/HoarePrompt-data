You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of occurrences in tuple `tup` of all elements present in list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as parameters and returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` of all elements present in `lst`. The function effectively counts each occurrence of every element from `lst` that exists in `tup`, regardless of the order or frequency of elements in either the tuple or the list. It handles cases where elements in `lst` may not exist in `tup`, in which case they are simply not counted. The function also implicitly handles scenarios where `lst` or `tup` might be empty, returning 0 in such cases since there would be nothing to count. Additionally, if there are duplicate elements in `lst`, each of them is counted separately as long as they exist in `tup`. The final state of the program after execution is that the variables `tup` and `lst` remain unchanged, and an integer value representing the total count is returned.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
