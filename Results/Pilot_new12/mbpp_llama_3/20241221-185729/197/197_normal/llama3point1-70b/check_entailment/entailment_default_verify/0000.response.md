The original assessment and the provided code align with the problem description, which is to write a Python function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. The function `func_1(tup, lst)` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list `lst` and counts its occurrences in the tuple `tup` using the `count` method. This approach effectively calculates the total occurrence of all elements in `lst` that exist in `tup`, regardless of their order or frequency in either data structure.

The output hints further support the correctness of the program by detailing how it handles various scenarios, such as:
- Counting each occurrence of every element from `lst` that exists in `tup`.
- Handling cases where elements in `lst` may not exist in `tup`, by simply not counting them.
- Implicitly handling empty `lst` or `tup`, by returning 0 due to the absence of elements to count.
- Correctly counting duplicate elements in `lst` separately if they exist in `tup`.
- Leaving the original state of `tup` and `lst` unchanged after execution, with the function returning an integer representing the total count.

Given this analysis, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The function behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles various edge cases without error, ensuring that it correctly counts the occurrences of list elements in the tuple.

Final: **True**
