The program provided counts the total occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description requires. 

Here is why it is correct:
- The function `func_1(tup, lst)` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as arguments.
- The `sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` line uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst`, count its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method, and then sum up all these counts.
- This approach ensures that for each element in the list, its occurrences in the tuple are counted, and all these counts are summed up to give the total count of occurrences in the tuple of all elements present in the list.
- The function returns this total count, which meets the requirement of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
