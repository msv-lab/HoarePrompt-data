Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description because it correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Counting occurrences**: The program uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list `lst`. For each element, it counts the occurrences of that element in the tuple `tup` using the `count` method of the tuple.

2. **Handling cases where elements in `lst` may not exist in `tup`**: The `count` method returns 0 if the element is not found in the tuple. Therefore, elements in `lst` that do not exist in `tup` are correctly counted as 0, not contributing to the total count.

3. **Handling empty `lst` or `tup`**: If either `lst` or `tup` is empty, the function will return 0. This is because the `count` method will always return 0 for an empty tuple, and the `sum` function will return 0 for an empty iterable.

4. **Handling duplicate elements in `lst`**: Each occurrence of an element in `lst` is counted separately as long as it exists in `tup`. This is because the generator expression iterates over each element in `lst`, and for each one, it counts the occurrences in `tup`.

5. **Preserving the state of `tup` and `lst`**: The function does not modify `tup` or `lst` since it only uses methods that do not modify the tuple or list (e.g., `count` method) and does not assign to `tup` or `lst` within the function.

Therefore, the program correctly fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct in all potential cases where valid inputs are provided.
