Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input and returns the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`.

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list `elements` and counts the occurrences of each element in the tuple `tup` using the `count` method. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the total count of all occurrences.

The program handles various edge cases:

* If the list `elements` is empty, the function will return 0 because there are no elements to count.
* If the tuple `tup` is empty, the function will return 0 because there are no elements in the tuple to count.
* If the list `elements` contains duplicate elements, the function will count each occurrence of each element in the tuple `tup`.
* If the tuple `tup` contains duplicate elements, the function will count each occurrence of each element from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various inputs.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
