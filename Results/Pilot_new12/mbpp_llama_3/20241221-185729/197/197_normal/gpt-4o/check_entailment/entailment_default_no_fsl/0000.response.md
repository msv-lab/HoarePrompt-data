Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately counts the occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple. The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the list and uses the `count` method to find the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple. It then sums up these counts to get the total number of occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.

The code handles various cases correctly:

* If the list `elements` is empty, the function will return 0 because the `sum` function will be called with an empty generator.
* If the tuple `tup` is empty, the function will return 0 because the `count` method will return 0 for each element in the list.
* If the list `elements` contains duplicate elements, the function will count each occurrence of the duplicated elements separately.
* If the tuple `tup` contains duplicate elements, the function will count each occurrence of these elements.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code, as they cover different scenarios and the function behaves as expected in each case. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's correctness is not affected by potential edge cases such as invalid input types or values.
