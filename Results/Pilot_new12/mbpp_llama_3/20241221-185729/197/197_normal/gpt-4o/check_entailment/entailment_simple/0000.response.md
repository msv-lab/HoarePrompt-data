Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input and returns the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list `elements`.
2. For each element, it uses the `count` method of the tuple `tup` to count the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple.
3. The `sum` function is then used to add up the counts of all elements, resulting in the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`.
4. The function returns this total count, which is the expected output based on the problem description.

The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input scenarios. The function correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup` and returns the total count.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says. It handles all potential cases as expected and returns the correct output for valid inputs.
