Correctness: **True**

The given code is correct because it counts the occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple as required by the problem description. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple using the `count` method. This approach ensures that all occurrences of each element are counted, and the total count is returned.

The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or an empty tuple, in which case it returns 0. Additionally, the function can handle duplicate elements in both the list and the tuple, correctly counting each occurrence.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of how the function works. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs. 

Since the function works as expected for all potential cases, including the edge cases, and the Output hints and examples agree with the code, the code is correct.
