Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element in the list. The `count` method of the tuple is used to count the occurrences of each element. 

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. 

The given function will work correctly for any potential case, including:

- When the tuple and the list are empty.
- When the tuple and the list contain duplicate elements.
- When the tuple and the list contain different data types (e.g., strings and integers).
- When the list contains elements that are not present in the tuple.

In all these cases, the function will correctly count the occurrences of the elements in the list within the tuple. 

No potential case has been found where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
