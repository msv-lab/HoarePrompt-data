Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

* The function takes two parameters: `tup` (the tuple to search in) and `elements` (the list of elements to count).
* The `sum` function is used with a generator expression to iterate over each element in `elements`.
* For each element, the `count` method of the tuple `tup` is used to count the number of occurrences of that element.
* The results of these counts are summed up to get the total count of all elements in the list.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function. They cover different scenarios, such as counting multiple elements, and the function returns the expected results.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the function would not work as expected. The function correctly handles cases with multiple occurrences of the same element, as well as cases with different data types (e.g., strings and integers). Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
