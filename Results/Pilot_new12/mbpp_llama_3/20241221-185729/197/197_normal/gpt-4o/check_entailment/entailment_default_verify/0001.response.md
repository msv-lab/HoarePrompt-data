Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. 

The code uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list `elements` and count its occurrences in the tuple `tup`. This approach ensures that each element in the list is accounted for, regardless of whether it appears once or multiple times in the tuple.

The output hints provide additional insight into the function's behavior, confirming that it handles various edge cases, such as:

1.  An empty list `elements`, in which case the function returns 0.
2.  An empty tuple `tup`, in which case the function also returns 0.
3.  Duplicate elements in the list `elements`, which are correctly counted.
4.  Duplicate elements in the tuple `tup`, which are also correctly counted.

The function's behavior aligns with the problem description, which asks for a count of all occurrences of elements from the list in the tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles different scenarios correctly and does not modify the input data.

Given this analysis, the original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the output hints support its correctness.

Final: **True**
