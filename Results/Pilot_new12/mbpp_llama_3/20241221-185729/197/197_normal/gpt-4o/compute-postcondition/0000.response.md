The code calculates the count of each element in the list `elements` that exists in the tuple `tup` and sums them up. The result is stored in the variable `count`. 

The value of `count` is equal to the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` that exists in `tup`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple, `elements` is a list, `count` is equal to the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` that exists in `tup`.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `elements` is a list, `count` is equal to `sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)`**
