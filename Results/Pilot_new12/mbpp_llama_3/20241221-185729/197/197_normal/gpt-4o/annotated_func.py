#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elements is a list.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of occurrences of all elements from list 'elements' in tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input, and returns the total count of occurrences of all elements from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`. The function handles cases where elements from the list are not present in the tuple, and counts each occurrence of an element from the list in the tuple. The function does not modify the input tuple or list. If the list `elements` is empty, the function will return 0, because there are no elements to count. If the tuple `tup` is empty, the function will return 0, because there are no elements in the tuple to count. The function will also work correctly even if the list `elements` contains duplicate elements, or if the tuple `tup` contains duplicate elements. The function returns an integer value representing the total count of occurrences.
