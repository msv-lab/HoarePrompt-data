#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers, where the rounded numbers are the rounded versions of the numbers in the list 'numbers' and the total count is the number of elements in 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, calculates the sum of their rounded versions, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. It handles lists of any length and content, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of 0 and any number is 0. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a single value, which is the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers.
