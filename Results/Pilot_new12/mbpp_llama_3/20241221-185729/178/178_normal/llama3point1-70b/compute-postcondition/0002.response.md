To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is as follows: 
- `numbers` is a list of numbers.
- `rounded_numbers` is a list where each element is the rounded version of the corresponding number in `numbers`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all the numbers in `rounded_numbers`.

The code snippet is: 
```
return total_sum * len(numbers)
```

Given this information, the return value is the product of `total_sum` and the length of the `numbers` list. 

`total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`, which means it's the sum of the rounded versions of all numbers in `numbers`. The length of `numbers` is the count of how many numbers are in the `numbers` list.

Therefore, the program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers, where the rounded numbers are the rounded versions of the numbers in the list 'numbers' and the total count is the number of elements in 'numbers'.**
