To determine the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given Python code snippet affects it.

Initial State: 
- `numbers` is a list of numbers.
- `rounded_numbers` is a list where each element is the rounded version of the corresponding element in `numbers`, achieved by applying the `round()` function to each number (`num`) in `numbers`.

Given Code:
```python
total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code calculates the sum of all elements in the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns this sum to a new variable named `total_sum`.
- The `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` lists remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.
- The `total_sum` variable is new and its value is the sum of the rounded numbers.

Output State:
Given that `rounded_numbers` is derived from `numbers` by rounding each number, the `total_sum` is essentially the sum of these rounded numbers. Therefore, `total_sum` equals the sum of `round(num)` for each `num` in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each element is `round(num)` for `num` in `numbers`, and `total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`.**
