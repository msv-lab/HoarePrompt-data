Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input. It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer using the `round` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list.

This program correctly follows the problem description. It handles every potential case by:

1. Rounding every number in the given list.
2. Calculating the total sum of these rounded numbers.
3. Multiplying this total sum by the length of the list.

It does not contain any conditional statements or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. The list comprehension and built-in functions like `round`, `sum`, and `len` ensure that the function works as expected for all valid inputs.

For example, if the input list is `[1.2, 2.7, 3.4]`, the function rounds these numbers to `[1, 3, 3]`, calculates their sum as `7`, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list (`3`), resulting in `21`. This result aligns with the problem description.

Without any known limitations or exceptions, the program appears to be correct for all cases.
