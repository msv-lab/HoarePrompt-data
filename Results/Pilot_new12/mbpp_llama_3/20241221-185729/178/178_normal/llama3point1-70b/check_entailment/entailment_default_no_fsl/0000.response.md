Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number using the `round` function, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. 

The output hints agree with the code's behavior, including the handling of edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. The function does not modify the original list and returns a single value, which is the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers.

The code correctly handles the case when the input list is empty, returning 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of 0 and any number is 0. 

Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or contains non-numeric elements. 

Overall, the function is correctly implemented according to the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
