You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a function named `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns this sum multiplied by the length of the input list. This operation directly follows the problem description.

The key components of the function are:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` effectively rounds every number in the input list. The `round()` function in Python rounds a number to the nearest integer, which is the expected behavior.

2. **Calculating Sum**: The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the rounded numbers, which is stored in `total_sum`.

3. **Multiplication by Length**: Finally, the function returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the input list (`len(numbers)`), which matches the requirement to multiply the total sum by the length of the list.

Given the problem description and analyzing the code, it seems to correctly implement the required functionality without any logical errors or omitted edge cases. It handles the rounding, summing, and multiplication operations as described. Since no specific case can be found where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the code is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers, where the rounded numbers are the rounded versions of the numbers in the list 'numbers' and the total count is the number of elements in 'numbers'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
