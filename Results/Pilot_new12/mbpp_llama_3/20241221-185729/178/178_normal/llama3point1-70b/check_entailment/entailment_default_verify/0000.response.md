Based on the provided problem description, the given Python program, the original assessment, and the output hints, I conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

The problem description asks to write a function that rounds every number in a given list of numbers and prints the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns this sum multiplied by the length of the input list.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, citing that it effectively rounds every number, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the list. This aligns with the problem description.

The output hints further support the correctness of the program by detailing its behavior, including handling lists of any length and content, not modifying the original list, and returning the expected product. They also clarify the program's behavior in edge cases, such as when the input list is empty, which is consistent with how one would expect the program to behave based on the problem description.

A key point that could have raised a concern about the program's correctness is how it handles an empty list. The output hints explicitly state that if the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is mathematically correct because the sum of an empty list is 0, and any number multiplied by 0 is 0. This aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description and shows the program handles this edge case as would be expected.

Therefore, considering all the provided information, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
