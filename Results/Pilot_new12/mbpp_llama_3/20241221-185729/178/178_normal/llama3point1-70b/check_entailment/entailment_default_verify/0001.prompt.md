You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input. It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer using the `round` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the original list.

This program correctly follows the problem description. It handles every potential case by:

1. Rounding every number in the given list.
2. Calculating the total sum of these rounded numbers.
3. Multiplying this total sum by the length of the list.

It does not contain any conditional statements or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. The list comprehension and built-in functions like `round`, `sum`, and `len` ensure that the function works as expected for all valid inputs.

For example, if the input list is `[1.2, 2.7, 3.4]`, the function rounds these numbers to `[1, 3, 3]`, calculates their sum as `7`, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list (`3`), resulting in `21`. This result aligns with the problem description.

Without any known limitations or exceptions, the program appears to be correct for all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numbers, calculates the sum of their rounded versions, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. It handles lists of any length and content, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of 0 and any number is 0. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a single value, which is the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
