Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the list.

The given code correctly implements this functionality. It uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list.

The code also correctly handles the edge case where the input list is empty. In this case, the `sum` function will return 0, and the product of 0 and the length of the list (which is also 0) will also be 0, which is the expected result.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior, but they do not reveal any cases where the code does not work correctly. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases.
