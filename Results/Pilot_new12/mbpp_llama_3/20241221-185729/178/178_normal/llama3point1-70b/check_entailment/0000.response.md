Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a function named `func_1` that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns this sum multiplied by the length of the input list. This operation directly follows the problem description.

The key components of the function are:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` effectively rounds every number in the input list. The `round()` function in Python rounds a number to the nearest integer, which is the expected behavior.

2. **Calculating Sum**: The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the rounded numbers, which is stored in `total_sum`.

3. **Multiplication by Length**: Finally, the function returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the input list (`len(numbers)`), which matches the requirement to multiply the total sum by the length of the list.

Given the problem description and analyzing the code, it seems to correctly implement the required functionality without any logical errors or omitted edge cases. It handles the rounding, summing, and multiplication operations as described. Since no specific case can be found where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the code is considered correct.
