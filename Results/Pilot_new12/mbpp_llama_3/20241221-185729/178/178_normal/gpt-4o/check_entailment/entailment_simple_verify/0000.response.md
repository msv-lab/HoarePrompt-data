Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I have evaluated the program's behavior and reasoning. The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` implements the problem description accurately. 

The problem description asks to round every number in a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The function `func_1` does exactly this: it rounds each number in the input list using a list comprehension, calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior. It states that the program returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of all numbers in the list and the total count of numbers in the list, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, which suggests that the function works correctly for various inputs, including positive and negative numbers, integers, and floating-point numbers.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
