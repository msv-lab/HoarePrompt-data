Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly rounds every number in the given list using the `round()` function, calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works as expected for various inputs, including lists containing both positive and negative numbers, as well as a mix of integers and floating-point numbers. 

The code handles the rounding correctly, and the calculation of the total sum and multiplication by the length of the list is straightforward and accurate. Since all potential cases that can be thought of work as expected according to the problem description and there are no apparent edge cases that the code fails to handle, the program is correct. 

In the given code:
- The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer.
- `sum(rounded_numbers)` calculates the sum of these rounded numbers.
- `total_sum * len(numbers)` then multiplies this sum by the number of elements in the original list.

Given that this logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and that the provided assertions pass, it suggests the code is functioning as intended without any identifiable errors or omissions in the handling of the described task.
