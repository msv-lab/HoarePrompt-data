Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer using the `round` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the list. 

The code aligns with the problem description and handles all cases as specified. The function correctly rounds each number, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the total count of numbers. It also correctly handles lists of any size, including empty lists, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. 

Since we assume the input will always be a list of numbers and we do not need to check for any potential errors, we consider the function correct for all potential cases. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional insight into how the function operates, stating that it will return 0 for an empty list, which is a correct behavior given that the sum of an empty list is 0 and any number multiplied by 0 is 0.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, including lists with both positive and negative numbers, as well as lists containing both integers and floats. Given the alignment of the code with the problem description, the correct handling of rounded numbers, and the successful passing of the provided unit tests, the function is considered correct.
