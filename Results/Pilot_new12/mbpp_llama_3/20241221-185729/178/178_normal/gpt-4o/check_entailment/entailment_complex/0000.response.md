Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description exactly. Here's why:

1. **Rounding numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list to the nearest integer using the `round` function. This meets the requirement of rounding every number in the given list.

2. **Calculating the sum**: The program calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum` function. This meets the requirement of calculating the total sum of the rounded numbers.

3. **Multiplying by the length of the list**: The program multiplies the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the input list using the `len` function. This meets the requirement of multiplying the total sum by the length of the list.

4. **Returning the result**: The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the length of the list. This meets the requirement of printing(or returning in this case) the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

The program handles lists of any size, including empty lists, correctly because the sum of an empty list is 0 and any number multiplied by 0 is 0. The program also assumes that the input is a list of numbers, which is a valid assumption given the problem statement.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
