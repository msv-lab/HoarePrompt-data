Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list.

The function uses a list comprehension to efficiently round each number in the input list. It then uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers. Finally, it multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, which suggests that the function works correctly for various inputs, including positive and negative numbers, integers, and floating-point numbers.

I couldn't find any edge case or potential input for which the function would not work correctly according to the problem description. The function handles empty lists (which would result in a total sum of 0 and a final result of 0), lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. It also correctly handles lists containing a mix of integers and floating-point numbers.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and implements the problem description accurately.
