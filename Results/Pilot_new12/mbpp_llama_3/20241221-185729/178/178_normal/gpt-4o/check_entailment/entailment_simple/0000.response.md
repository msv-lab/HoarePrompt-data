Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It rounds every number in the list using a list comprehension and the `round` function, and stores the result in `rounded_numbers`.
3. It calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum` function and stores the result in `total_sum`.
4. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the list (i.e., the total count of numbers) using the `len` function and stores the result in `result`.
5. Finally, it returns the result, which is the product of the sum of the rounded values of all numbers in the list and the total count of numbers in the list.

The program does not have any conditional statements or loops that could potentially cause it to deviate from the problem description. It performs the required operations in a straightforward and deterministic manner.

Additionally, the provided unit tests demonstrate that the program produces the expected results for different input lists, which further confirms its correctness.

The only thing missing from the program is the print statement mentioned in the problem description. However, it seems that the function is expected to return the result instead of printing it, as indicated by the return statement and the unit tests. If the intention was to print the result instead of returning it, the program would be incorrect, but based on the provided code and unit tests, it appears that the function is supposed to return the result.
