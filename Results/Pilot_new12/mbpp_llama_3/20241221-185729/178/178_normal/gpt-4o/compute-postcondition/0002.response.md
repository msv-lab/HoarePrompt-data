`result` is assigned the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of `numbers`. The state of `numbers` is not affected, so `numbers` is still a list of numbers. The state of `rounded_numbers` is also not affected, so `rounded_numbers` is still a list where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`. The state of `total_sum` is not affected, so `total_sum` is still the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`, `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`**
