#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of all numbers in the list and the total count of numbers in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and then returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the list. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, in which case it will return 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and any number multiplied by 0 is 0. The function does not modify the original list and assumes that the input is a list of numbers, potentially including floats or other numeric types, and it does not include any error checking for non-numeric values. The result is the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers, effectively giving a weighted sum where the weight is the total count of numbers.
