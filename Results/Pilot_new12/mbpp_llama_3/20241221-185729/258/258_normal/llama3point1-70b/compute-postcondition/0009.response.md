To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for digit in num_str:
    sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```
The loop iterates over each character `digit` in the string `num_str`, which is the string representation of the non-negative integer `num`. For each iteration, it adds the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len` to the variable `sum`.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

* `num` remains a non-negative integer.
* `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
* `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, which is also the length of the string `num_str`.
* `sum` is the sum of the values of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `sum` will be the sum of the values of all digits in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`. If `num_str` is empty (i.e., `num` is 0), the loop will not execute, and `sum` will remain 0.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is the sum of the values of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`, or 0 if `num` is 0.**
