The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` updates the value of `sum` by adding the value of the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`. 

Given that `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with at least 2 characters, and `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, we know that `num_len` represents the number of digits in `num_str`. 

However, without knowing the specific value of `digit`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum`. We can only express it as the old value of `sum` plus the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. 

The states of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is updated to its old value plus `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is the old value of `sum` plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len`**
