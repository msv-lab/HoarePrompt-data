To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and state before the loop starts.

The loop iterates over each character `digit` in the string `num_str`. For this loop to execute, `num_str` must have at least one character. Since `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, and `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will have at least one character if `num` is not 0.

Given states:
- `num` is a non-negative integer
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num`
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`
- `sum` is 0

Adjustments needed for the loop to execute:
- `num_str` must have at least one character, which implies `num` must be greater than 0 or `num_str` must be '0' to have a loop execution.
- Since `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, for the loop to execute, `num_len` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `digit` will take the value of the first character in `num_str` at the start of the loop.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`**
