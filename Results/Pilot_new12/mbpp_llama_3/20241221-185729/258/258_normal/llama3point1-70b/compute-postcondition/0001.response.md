The code calculates the length of the string `num_str` and assigns it to `num_len`. Since `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, the length of `num_str` is equal to the number of digits in `num`. 

Therefore, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`**
