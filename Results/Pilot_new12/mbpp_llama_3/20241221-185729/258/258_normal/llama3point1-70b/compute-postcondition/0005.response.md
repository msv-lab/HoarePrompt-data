According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`. If `num_str` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is `int(digit)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters, and since one character has been processed, the remaining string must have at least one character. The `num_len` must be greater than or equal to 2. The `sum` will be updated with the next digit.
