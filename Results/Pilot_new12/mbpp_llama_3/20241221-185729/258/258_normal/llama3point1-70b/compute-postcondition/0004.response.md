The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. The value of `digit` is the first character in `num_str`, which is a string representation of `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is `int(digit)` ** `num_len`, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`**
