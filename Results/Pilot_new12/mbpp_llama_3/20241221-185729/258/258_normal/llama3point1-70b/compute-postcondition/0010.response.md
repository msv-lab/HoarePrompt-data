To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the return statement.

Given:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.
- `sum` is the sum of the values of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`, or 0 if `num` is 0.

The return statement is `return sum == num`.

This means the program will return a boolean value indicating whether `sum` is equal to `num`.

Since `sum` is calculated based on `num` (specifically, the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`), and considering `num` can be any non-negative integer, the comparison `sum == num` will depend on the specific value of `num`.

For example, if `num` is 0, `sum` will be 0, so `sum == num` will be True. For other values of `num`, the result will depend on whether the sum of the digits of `num` raised to the power of the number of digits equals `num` itself.

Therefore, without a specific value for `num`, we can say that the program returns a boolean value indicating the result of the comparison between `sum` (the sum of the digits of `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`) and `num` itself.

Output State: **The program returns True if the sum of the digits of `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` equals `num`, and False otherwise.**
