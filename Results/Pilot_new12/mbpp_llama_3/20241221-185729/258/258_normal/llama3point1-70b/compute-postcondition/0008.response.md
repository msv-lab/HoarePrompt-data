The code increments the value of `sum` by the value of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`. 

To understand the impact of this code, let's consider the initial state: 
- `num` is a non-negative integer, 
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with at least 2 characters, 
- `num_len` is at least 2, 
- `sum` is the accumulation of `int(digit)` to the power of decreasing `num_len`.

After the execution of the given code, `sum` will be updated to `sum + int(digit) ** num_len`. 

The value of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` remains unchanged because the given code does not modify these variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`num` is a non-negative integer, 
`num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, 
`num_len` is at least 2, 
`sum` is the updated accumulation of `int(digit)` to the power of decreasing `num_len`, which can be expressed as the old `sum` plus `int(digit)` raised to the power of the current `num_len`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, `num_len` is at least 2, `sum` is the old `sum` plus `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`**
