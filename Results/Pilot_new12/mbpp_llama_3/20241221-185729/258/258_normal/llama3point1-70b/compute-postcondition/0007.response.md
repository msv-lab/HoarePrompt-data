According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`. If `num_str` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has at least 2 characters, and since one character has been processed, for the loop to execute again, `num_str` must have at least 2 characters left after the previous iteration, meaning it must have had at least 3 characters initially and now has at least 2 characters left after processing one character. `num_len` must be greater than or equal to 2 plus 1 (for the character that has been processed) for one more iteration to happen, so it must be greater than or equal to 3 initially for the loop to have executed at least twice, and now it should be greater than or equal to 2 for one more iteration, considering one character has been processed.

However, focusing strictly on the change from the previous iteration to the next: 
- `num_str` must have at least one more character than what was left after the last iteration, implying it originally had more characters.
- Since `num_len` represents the length of `num_str` and one character has been processed in the loop, for the loop to execute again, it means we are considering the state before the next iteration starts, thus considering the length after one iteration has occurred.

But the precise adjustment in state considering the loop's progression:
- `num` remains a non-negative integer as its value isn't directly modified by the loop's iterative process described.
- `num_str` must have had at least 3 characters initially for the loop to execute more than once, now it must have at least 2 characters for the next iteration to happen, considering one character has been processed.
- `num_len` should reflect the length of `num_str` after one character has been processed, so it must be at least 2 for the next iteration.
- `sum` is the old value of `sum` plus `int(digit)` to the power of `num_len`, but since we're focusing on the state adjustment for the next iteration rather than the calculation within the loop body, we acknowledge its value will change with each iteration but the exact change depends on the digit being processed.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, `num_len` is at least 2, `sum` is the accumulation of `int(digit)` to the power of decreasing `num_len`**
