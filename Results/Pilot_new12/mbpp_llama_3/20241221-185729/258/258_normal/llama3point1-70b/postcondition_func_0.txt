The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the digits of `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` equals `num`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including 0, and correctly calculates the sum for single-digit and multi-digit numbers. It returns `True` if the sum equals `num`, and `False` otherwise, covering edge cases such as when `num` is 0 or a single-digit number. The function does not modify the input `num` and only uses it to calculate the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits, ensuring that the original value of `num` remains unchanged.
