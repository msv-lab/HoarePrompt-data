Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The provided program does exactly that. It takes a non-negative integer `num` as input, calculates the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, and checks if this sum equals `num`. If the sum equals `num`, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects a non-negative integer `num`. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-negative integer), the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

2. **Calculation**: It converts the number to a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len`. Then, it iterates through each digit in `num_str`, raises the digit to the power of `num_len`, and sums these values.

3. **Comparison**: After calculating the sum, it compares this sum to the original number `num`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating `num` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `num` is 0 or a single-digit number. For 0, the sum will be 0 (since 0 raised to any power is 0), and the function correctly returns `True` because 0 is considered an Armstrong number. For single-digit numbers, the sum will be the number itself (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number), so the function also correctly returns `True` for these cases.

Therefore, the program accurately implements the logic required to determine if a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number, as described in the problem statement.
