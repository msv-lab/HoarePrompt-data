Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1(num)` that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:
- Converts the input number to a string to be able to iterate over its digits.
- Calculates the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number).
- Initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will hold the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
- Iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to `sum`.
- Returns `True` if the calculated sum equals the original number and `False` otherwise.

This logic aligns perfectly with the definition of an Armstrong number, and there are no obvious cases where the function would not work as expected. It correctly handles numbers of any length and will return the correct result for all Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers. 

For example, for the input `153`, which is an Armstrong number because `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`, the function will correctly return `True`. For any non-Armstrong number, it will correctly return `False`. 

Therefore, without being able to find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the program is considered correct.
