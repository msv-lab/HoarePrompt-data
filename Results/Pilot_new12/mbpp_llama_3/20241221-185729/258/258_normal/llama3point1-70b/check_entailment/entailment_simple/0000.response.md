Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It converts the input number to a string `num_str` to easily access each digit.
2. It calculates the length of the string `num_str` (which is the number of digits in the number) and stores it in `num_len`.
3. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and then iterates over each digit in `num_str`.
4. For each digit, it raises the digit to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits) and adds the result to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits (`sum`) is equal to the original number `num`. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including numbers with multiple digits and single-digit numbers (which are trivially Armstrong numbers). It also correctly handles the case where the input number is 0, in which case the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits is also 0, and therefore it returns `True`.

Overall, the program accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number and correctly identifies whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.
