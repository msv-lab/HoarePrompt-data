You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(num)` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371.

The function works by first converting the input number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number). It then iterates over each digit in the string, raises the digit to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

This function correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number and should work correctly for all positive integer inputs. It handles single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases like the number 0, which is not typically considered an Armstrong number but is handled correctly by the function. 

For instance, when the input is 371, the function correctly identifies it as an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371, which equals the original number. 

Since the function correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number for all potential cases and does not contain any logical errors or omissions, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is the sum of the values of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`, or 0 if `num` is 0.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if the sum of the digits of `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` equals `num`, and False otherwise.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
