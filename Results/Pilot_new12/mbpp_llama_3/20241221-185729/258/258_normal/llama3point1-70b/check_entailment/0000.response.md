Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(num)` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371.

The function works by first converting the input number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number). It then iterates over each digit in the string, raises the digit to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

This function correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number and should work correctly for all positive integer inputs. It handles single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases like the number 0, which is not typically considered an Armstrong number but is handled correctly by the function. 

For instance, when the input is 371, the function correctly identifies it as an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371, which equals the original number. 

Since the function correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number for all potential cases and does not contain any logical errors or omissions, it is considered correct.
