Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function `func_1(num)` takes an integer as input, calculates the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits, and returns `True` if the sum equals the original number, and `False` otherwise.

The output hints confirm that the function handles all non-negative integers, including 0, and correctly calculates the sum for single-digit and multi-digit numbers. It covers edge cases such as when `num` is 0 or a single-digit number, and returns the expected result.

The code is correct because it follows the definition of an Armstrong number and handles all potential cases, including edge cases. The use of a for loop to iterate over the digits of the number, the calculation of the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits, and the comparison of the sum with the original number are all correct and in line with the problem description. 

Since we assume that the input will be a valid non-negative integer, the function will work correctly for all possible inputs and will not cause any errors. Therefore, the code meets the requirements in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
