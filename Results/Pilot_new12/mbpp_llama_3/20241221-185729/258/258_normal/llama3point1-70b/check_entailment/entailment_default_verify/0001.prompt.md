You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1(num)` that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works as follows:
- Converts the input number to a string to be able to iterate over its digits.
- Calculates the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number).
- Initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will hold the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
- Iterates over each digit in the string representation of the number, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to `sum`.
- Returns `True` if the calculated sum equals the original number and `False` otherwise.

This logic aligns perfectly with the definition of an Armstrong number, and there are no obvious cases where the function would not work as expected. It correctly handles numbers of any length and will return the correct result for all Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers. 

For example, for the input `153`, which is an Armstrong number because `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`, the function will correctly return `True`. For any non-Armstrong number, it will correctly return `False`. 

Therefore, without being able to find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the digits of `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` equals `num`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including 0, and correctly calculates the sum for single-digit and multi-digit numbers. It returns `True` if the sum equals `num`, and `False` otherwise, covering edge cases such as when `num` is 0 or a single-digit number. The function does not modify the input `num` and only uses it to calculate the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits, ensuring that the original value of `num` remains unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
