To assess the correctness of the program, let's first analyze the problem description and the provided code.

The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371.

The provided Python function `func_1(num)` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. It works by first converting the input number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number). It then iterates over each digit in the string, raises the digit to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

However, upon closer examination, it appears that the function does not correctly implement the definition of an Armstrong number for all cases. The function raises each digit to the power of the number of digits, but according to the definition of an Armstrong number, each digit should be raised to the power of the fixed exponent, which is always 3, not the number of digits.

For example, when the input is 371, the function calculates 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3, which is correct. But when the input is a 4-digit number, the function calculates each digit to the power of 4, not 3.

The output hints provided do not contradict this observation, as they describe the function's behavior in a general sense but do not explicitly confirm that it calculates the sum of cubes of the digits.

Based on this reasoning, the original assessment does not accurately reflect the program's correctness. The program does not meet the problem description for all non-negative integers, as it does not correctly calculate the sum of cubes of the digits for numbers with a variable number of digits.

Therefore, the refined assessment is:

Final: **False**
