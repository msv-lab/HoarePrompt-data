To calculate the output state, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.
- `armstrong_sum` equals the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return armstrong_sum == n
```

This means the program will return `True` if `armstrong_sum` is equal to `n`, and `False` otherwise.

An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. Therefore, the return statement essentially checks if the number `n` is an Armstrong number.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, and considering the properties of Armstrong numbers, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is an Armstrong number or not.

Output State: **The program returns True if `n` is an Armstrong number (i.e., the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals `n`), and False otherwise.**
