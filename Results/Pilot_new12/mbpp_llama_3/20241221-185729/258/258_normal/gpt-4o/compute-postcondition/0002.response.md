To solve this, let's break down the given code and initial state:

Initial State: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.

The code is calculating `armstrong_sum`, which is the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`. This can be expressed as follows:

`armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`

Given the initial state, we know:
- `n` can be any non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2,...).
- `num_str` is the string form of `n`, meaning if `n` is 123, `num_str` would be "123".
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, which corresponds to the number of digits in `n`.

Now, let's consider what `armstrong_sum` would be. For any given digit `digit` in `num_str`, we take the integer value of that digit and raise it to the power of `num_len`. We do this for each digit in `num_str` and sum up all these values to get `armstrong_sum`.

For example, if `n = 371` (a classic Armstrong number), then:
- `num_str = "371"`.
- `num_len = 3`.
- For each digit: 
  - The first digit "3" becomes `3 ** 3 = 27`.
  - The second digit "7" becomes `7 ** 3 = 343`.
  - The third digit "1" becomes `1 ** 3 = 1`.
- `armstrong_sum = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371`, which equals `n`.

However, without a specific value of `n`, we can only express `armstrong_sum` in terms of `n` and `num_len`. Given `n` and knowing that `num_str` is its string representation and `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, `armstrong_sum` is a calculated value based on the digits of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The values of `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len` do not change; the code introduces a new variable `armstrong_sum` which is calculated based on `num_str` and `num_len`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.
- `armstrong_sum` equals the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, or in other words, `armstrong_sum` equals `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, and `armstrong_sum` equals `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`**
