The code calculates the length of the string `num_str` and assigns it to the variable `num_len`. Since `num_str` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `num_str` is equal to the number of digits in `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`**
