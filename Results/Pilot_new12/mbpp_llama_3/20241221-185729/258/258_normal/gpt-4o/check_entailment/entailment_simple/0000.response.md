Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Conversion**: The program converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits.
2. **Number of Digits**: The program calculates the number of digits `num_len` in the input number.
3. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression: `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`.
4. **Comparison**: The program compares the calculated Armstrong sum with the original input number `n` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number.

The program meets the problem description because it:

* Checks if the given number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
* Returns `True` if the number is an Armstrong number and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness:

* `func_1(153)` returns `True` because 153 is an Armstrong number (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153).
* `func_1(259)` returns `False` because 259 is not an Armstrong number.
* `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because 4458 is not an Armstrong number.

Overall, the program accurately implements the definition of an Armstrong number and meets the problem description.
