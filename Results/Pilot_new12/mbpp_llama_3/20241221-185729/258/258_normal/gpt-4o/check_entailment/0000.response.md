Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

In the given code, the function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and first converts it to a string to easily calculate the number of digits. Then, it calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number and returns `True` if it is (i.e., the number is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, `153` is an Armstrong number because `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`, so `func_1(153)` correctly returns `True`. Similarly, `259` is not an Armstrong number because `2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862`, which is not equal to `259`, so `func_1(259)` correctly returns `False`. The same reasoning applies to the other test case.

Since the function works correctly for all the test cases and the logic is sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.
