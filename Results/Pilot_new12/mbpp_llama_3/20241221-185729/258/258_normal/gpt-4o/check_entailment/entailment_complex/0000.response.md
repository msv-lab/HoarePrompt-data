Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to check whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number or not. 

The problem description requires a function to check if the sum of the digits of a number, each raised to the power of the number of digits, equals the number itself. 

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` does exactly this:

1. It converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits `num_len`.
2. It then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
3. Finally, it checks if this calculated sum equals the original number `n` and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating `n` is an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

The function covers all necessary cases as described:
- It works for single-digit numbers because the power will be 1, and any number to the power of 1 is itself.
- It works for multi-digit numbers by correctly calculating the power based on the number of digits.
- It also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 0, because 0 raised to any power is 0, which matches the definition of an Armstrong number.

Given the assumption that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description, making it correct.
