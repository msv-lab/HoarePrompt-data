Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a correct implementation of the problem description. It checks whether a given non-negative integer `n` is an Armstrong number. The function `func_1(n)` works by converting the number into a string to calculate the number of digits, then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. If this sum equals the original number, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests and output hints cover various cases, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases where `n` is not an Armstrong number. The code handles these cases correctly according to the definition of an Armstrong number.

The code does not explicitly handle cases like negative numbers or non-integer inputs, but based on the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-negative integer), the code behaves as expected for all potential valid inputs. There are no known or provided examples where the program does not work as described, and the given examples support the correctness of the program for the specified domain of valid inputs.
