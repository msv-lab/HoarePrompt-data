Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not by comparing the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits with the original number.

The output hints confirm that the function covers all potential cases, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases where `n` is 0. The function correctly handles non-negative integers and returns `True` if the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals `n`, and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. The function works correctly for all the test cases, and the logic is sound. The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
