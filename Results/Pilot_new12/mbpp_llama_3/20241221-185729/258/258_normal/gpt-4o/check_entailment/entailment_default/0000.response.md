Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided checks whether a given non-negative integer `n` is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits and comparing it to `n`. This logic aligns with the definition of an Armstrong number. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) cover both positive and negative cases for Armstrong numbers, and there is no indication from the output hints that the function fails to handle any specific cases, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, or the edge case where `n` is 0. The function correctly handles these cases by converting the number to a string to easily calculate the number of digits and then using a generator expression to calculate the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits. Given the assumption that the input will be a valid non-negative integer, the function appears to correctly determine whether the input is an Armstrong number for every potential case.
