The original assessment claims that the program is correct based on its logic and the provided unit tests. The problem description is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not, and the provided code implements this functionality correctly.

Upon examining the annotated version of the code, we can see that the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and returns `True` if this sum equals the original number, indicating that it is an Armstrong number. The annotations provided also accurately describe the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Given the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, it appears that the program meets the problem description. The logic implemented in the code is sound, and the unit tests provided confirm the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the final correctness of the program is maintained as accurate.

Final: **True**
