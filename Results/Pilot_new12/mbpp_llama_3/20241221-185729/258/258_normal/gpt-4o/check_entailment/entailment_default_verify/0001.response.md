The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number, which is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1(153) == True`, `assert func_1(259) == False`, `assert func_1(4458) == False`) demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including a single-digit Armstrong number (which is not a typical Armstrong number but the function still correctly returns False for single-digit numbers greater than 1), a multi-digit Armstrong number, and a non-Armstrong number.

Additionally, the output hints indicate that the function correctly handles various cases, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases where `n` is 0. Since 0 is equal to 0^1, the function will return True for the input 0, which is correct.

One may argue that the function does not handle negative numbers, but the problem description implies that the input will be a non-negative integer. Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking for negative numbers does not affect the program's correctness.

The function's implementation is straightforward and correctly applies the definition of an Armstrong number. The calculations are performed accurately, and the comparison between the sum of the powered digits and the original number is correct.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
