Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number or not. 

The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, converts it to a string to calculate the number of digits, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and checks if this sum is equal to the original number. The annotations in the code confirm this logic and describe the state of the program at different points.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, `153` is an Armstrong number because `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`, and `func_1(153)` correctly returns `True`. Similarly, `259` is not an Armstrong number because `2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862`, which is not equal to `259`, and `func_1(259)` correctly returns `False`.

The original assessment correctly concludes that the program is correct based on the logic and the unit tests. The annotated version of the code does not provide any new information that would contradict the original assessment. 

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
