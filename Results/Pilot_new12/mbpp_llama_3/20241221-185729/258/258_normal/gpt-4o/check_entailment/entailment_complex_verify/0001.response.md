Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I can see that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not.

The annotated version provides additional information about the state of the program at different points, but it does not contradict the original assessment. In fact, the annotated version supports the original assessment by explaining the purpose of each part of the function and the expected output.

The function correctly handles non-negative integers, converts the input number to a string to access each digit, calculates the length of the input number, and then calculates the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. If this sum equals the original number, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The original assessment mentioned that the function correctly handles numbers with different lengths and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers. The annotated version confirms this by stating that the function covers all potential cases, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and edge cases where `n` is 0.

Since the annotated version provides additional evidence that supports the original assessment, I maintain the original assessment. The program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number, and the provided unit tests pass, which indicates that the function is working correctly.

Final: **True**
