Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. It first converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily access each digit.
2. Then, it calculates the length of the input number `num_len`, which is used to determine the power to which each digit should be raised.
3. The `armstrong_sum` is calculated by summing the cubes of each digit (or raising each digit to the power of `num_len`).
4. Finally, it checks if the `armstrong_sum` is equal to the original number `n`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

All the provided unit tests (`assert func_1(153) == True`, `assert func_1(259) == False`, `assert func_1(4458) == False`) pass, which indicates that the function is working correctly for these test cases.

After analyzing the function, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles numbers with different lengths and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
