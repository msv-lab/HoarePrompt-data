Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as input. It then returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from a different index `i` in the range of `n`. 

This code behaves as described in the problem description for every potential case. It correctly splits the list into `n` sublists, covering all edge cases such as when `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, or when `lst` is empty. The code also preserves the original data in the returned sublists, which are slices of the original list. Since we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a list and a positive integer), the code does not need to handle cases where the input is invalid.

The code works by using list comprehension to generate the sublists. The expression `lst[i::n]` generates a slice of `lst` starting at index `i` and stepping by `n`, which effectively selects every `n`th element. The outer list comprehension `[... for i in range(n)]` repeats this process for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, resulting in `n` sublists with the desired elements.

Overall, the code accurately implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases correctly, assuming valid input.
