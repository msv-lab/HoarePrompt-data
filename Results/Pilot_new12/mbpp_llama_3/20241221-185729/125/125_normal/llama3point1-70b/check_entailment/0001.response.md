Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct according to the given problem description. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as inputs and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

- The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates `n` sublists.
- For each `i` in the range of `n`, `lst[i::n]` slices the list starting from the `i`-th index and takes every `n`-th element.
- The result is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a group of elements that are `n` positions apart in the original list.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected output.

This program correctly handles various edge cases, including:

- When `n` is 1, it returns a list containing the original list, as every element is selected.
- When `n` is equal to the length of the list, it returns a list containing the original list, as every element is selected only once.
- When `n` is greater than the length of the list, it returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains at most one element from the original list.

Since the program works as expected for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
