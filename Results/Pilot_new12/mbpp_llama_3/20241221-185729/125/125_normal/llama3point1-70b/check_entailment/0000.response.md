Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(lst, n)` correctly splits a list for every nth element. This function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. Here's how it works:
- It iterates over a range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`) to consider each possible starting point for the sublists.
- For each starting point `i`, it slices the list `lst` from index `i` to the end, stepping by `n` (`lst[i::n]`). This means that it selects every `n`th element from the list, starting at the `i`th index.

For example, if you have a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and you want to split it every `3` elements, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected output.

This function correctly handles various edge cases:
- If `n` is larger than the length of the list, it simply returns a list of lists where each inner list contains one element from the original list, with the number of inner lists being equal to `n`.
- If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing the original list, because splitting every 1 element does not change the list.

Overall, the function `func_1(lst, n)` accurately implements the requested behavior, handling all potential cases as described.
