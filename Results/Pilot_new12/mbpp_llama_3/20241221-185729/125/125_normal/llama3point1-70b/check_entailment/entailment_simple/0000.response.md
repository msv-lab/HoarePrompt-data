To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's break down what the problem description asks for and compare it with what the function `func_1` does.

The problem description requires a function that:
1. Takes in a list and an integer `n` as inputs.
2. Splits the input list for every `n`th element.
3. Returns a list of the resulting lists.

The provided function `func_1`:
1. Accepts a list `lst` and an integer `n` as parameters.
2. Utilizes list comprehension to generate sublists from `lst`.
3. Each sublist `lst[i::n]` contains every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from a different index `i` in the range of `n`.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the function `func_1` does not exactly match the problem description's requirement to "split a list for every nth element." The function actually creates sublists where each sublist contains elements at the same position in every nth group of elements, not necessarily splitting the list into segments of length `n`.

For instance, given `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function returns:
`[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`.

However, a correct interpretation of "splitting a list for every nth element" might yield segments of the list like this:
`[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`.

A function that splits the list correctly according to the problem statement could be implemented as follows:

```python
def correct_func(lst, n):
    return [lst[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(lst), n)]
```

Given the discrepancy between the problem description and the original function's behavior, we must conclude that the original function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
