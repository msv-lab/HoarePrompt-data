Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

The original assessment correctly describes how the function uses Python's list slicing feature to split a list for every nth element and handles various edge cases. The output hints also confirm the correctness of the function's behavior, including its ability to handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, where `lst` is empty, and where the function assumes `n` is a positive integer.

The function correctly returns a list of 'n' sublists, each containing every 'n'th element from `lst`, starting from a different index 'i' in the range of 'n'. It also does not modify the original list `lst`, preserving its elements in the returned sublists.

The only potential consideration that might affect the correctness is the assumption that `n` is a positive integer and that no error checking is performed on this assumption. However, the problem description explicitly states that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this does not impact the correctness of the function within the bounds of its specified inputs.

Given that the program matches the problem description and the output hints support the correctness of the function, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
