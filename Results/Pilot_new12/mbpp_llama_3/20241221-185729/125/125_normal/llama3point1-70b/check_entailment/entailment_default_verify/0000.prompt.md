You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(lst, n)` correctly splits a list for every nth element. This function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. Here's how it works:
- It iterates over a range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`) to consider each possible starting point for the sublists.
- For each starting point `i`, it slices the list `lst` from index `i` to the end, stepping by `n` (`lst[i::n]`). This means that it selects every `n`th element from the list, starting at the `i`th index.

For example, if you have a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and you want to split it every `3` elements, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected output.

This function correctly handles various edge cases:
- If `n` is larger than the length of the list, it simply returns a list of lists where each inner list contains one element from the original list, with the number of inner lists being equal to `n`.
- If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing the original list, because splitting every 1 element does not change the list.

Overall, the function `func_1(lst, n)` accurately implements the requested behavior, handling all potential cases as described.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of 'n' sublists. Each sublist contains every 'n'th element from `lst`, starting from a different index 'i' in the range of 'n'. The function covers all potential edge cases, including when `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. It also handles cases where `lst` is empty, returning a list of 'n' empty sublists. The function does not modify the original list `lst` and its elements are not altered in any way. The returned sublists are slices of the original list, preserving the original data. The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and does not perform any error checking on this assumption. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
