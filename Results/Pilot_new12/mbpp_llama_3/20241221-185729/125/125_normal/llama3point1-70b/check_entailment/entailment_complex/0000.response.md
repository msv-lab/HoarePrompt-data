Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as inputs, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from a different index `i` in the range of `n`.

The program achieves this by using list slicing with a step size of `n`. The expression `lst[i::n]` generates a slice of the list `lst` starting at index `i` and stepping by `n`. By iterating over `range(n)`, the program generates `n` such slices, each starting at a different index.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the program will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which meets the requirements.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, or when `lst` is empty. In these cases, the program returns a list of `n` sublists, with some sublists potentially being empty.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore its correctness is **True**.
