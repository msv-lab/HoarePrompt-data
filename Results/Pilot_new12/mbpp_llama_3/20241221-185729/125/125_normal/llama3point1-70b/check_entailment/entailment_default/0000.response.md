Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the described behavior. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`th element from `lst`, starting from a different index `i` in the range of `n`. 

The function handles the edge case where `n` is greater than the length of `lst` by creating sublists that may be empty. It also correctly handles the case where `lst` is empty, returning a list of `n` empty sublists.

The function does not modify the original list `lst` and its elements are not altered in any way. The returned sublists are slices of the original list, preserving the original data.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where `n` is not a positive integer or `lst` is not a list. 

For example, if we have the list `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected output. 

Therefore, the function seems to work correctly for all potential cases.
