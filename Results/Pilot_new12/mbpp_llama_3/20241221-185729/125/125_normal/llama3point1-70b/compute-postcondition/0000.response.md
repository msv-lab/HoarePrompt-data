To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet: `return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]`. 

Here, `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer. 

The code uses list comprehension to generate a new list. It iterates over the range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`), and for each iteration `i`, it slices the list `lst` starting from index `i` and takes every `n`th element.

So, the program returns a list of lists, where each sublist is a slice of `lst` with a step of `n`, starting from a different initial index `i`.

The number of sublists returned is equal to `n`, and each sublist contains elements from `lst`, spaced `n` indices apart, starting from the index `i`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist contains every 'n'th element from the list 'lst', starting from a different index 'i' in the range of 'n'.**
