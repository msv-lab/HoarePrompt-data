Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of 'n' sublists. Each sublist contains every 'n'th element from `lst`, starting from a different index 'i' in the range of 'n'. The function covers all potential edge cases, including when `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. It also handles cases where `lst` is empty, returning a list of 'n' empty sublists. The function does not modify the original list `lst` and its elements are not altered in any way. The returned sublists are slices of the original list, preserving the original data. The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and does not perform any error checking on this assumption. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected.**
