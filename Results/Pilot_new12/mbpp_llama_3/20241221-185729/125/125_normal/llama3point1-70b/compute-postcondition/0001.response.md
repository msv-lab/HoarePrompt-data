The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list, and `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of 'n' sublists. Each sublist contains every 'n'th element from the list 'lst', starting from a different index 'i' in the range of 'n'.
