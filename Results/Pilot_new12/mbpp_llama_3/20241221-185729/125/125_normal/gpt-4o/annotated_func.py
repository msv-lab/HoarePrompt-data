#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `element` is the last element in `lst`.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`, where `n` is a positive integer and `lst` is the original list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`. The input list `lst` remains unchanged, and the function handles cases where `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to the length of `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. The function's output is a new list of lists, with no modifications made to the original input list or integer. The cyclic distribution ensures that the first element of `lst` goes to the first sublist, the second element to the second sublist, and so on, wrapping around to the first sublist when the index exceeds `n-1`.
