To calculate the result, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the program. 

The code `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the `element` to the sublist in `result` at the index `i % n`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element
- `n` is a positive integer
- `result` is a list of `n` empty lists
- `i` is 0
- `element` is the first element in the list

Since `i` is 0, `i % n` equals 0. Therefore, the `element` is appended to the first sublist in `result`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, except for `result` which now has its first sublist containing the `element`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where the first list contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in the list**
