To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes some number of times.

The loop code is:
```python
for i, element in enumerate(lst):
    result[i % n].append(element)
```

From the loop code, we can understand that the loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. For each element at index `i`, it appends this element to the list in `result` at index `i % n`. This means that elements from `lst` are distributed across the lists in `result` in a cyclic manner based on the modulus of their index with `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is a list.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.

And the output states after the loop executes some number of times:
- After 1 time: `result` has the first element of `lst` appended to the first list.
- After 2 times: The description provided does not accurately reflect the operation of the loop. Given the loop code, the second element of `lst` would be appended to the second list in `result` (because `1 % n` equals `1` when `n` is greater than 1), not that the second list contains two instances of the second element.
- After 3 times: Similar to the misunderstanding after 2 times, the third element of `lst` would be appended to the third list in `result` (if `n` is at least 3), due to `2 % n` equals `2` when `n` is greater than 2.

Correcting the understanding based on the loop code:
- Each element in `lst` is appended to a list in `result` based on its index `i` modulo `n`. This means the distribution of elements from `lst` to `result` cycles through the lists in `result`.

If `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `result` remains a list of `n` empty lists.

After all iterations are completed:
- `lst` remains unchanged as it's the input list.
- `n` remains unchanged as it's used to determine the distribution of elements.
- `result` will have elements from `lst` distributed across its lists in a cyclic manner based on the index of each element in `lst` modulo `n`.
- `i` will be the last index of `lst` (which is `len(lst) - 1`), and `element` will be the last element in `lst`.

However, the exact distribution in `result` depends on the length of `lst` and the value of `n`. If `lst` has fewer elements than `n`, not all lists in `result` will have elements appended. If `lst` has more elements than `n`, the lists in `result` will have multiple elements appended in a cyclic manner.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `element` is the last element in `lst`.**
