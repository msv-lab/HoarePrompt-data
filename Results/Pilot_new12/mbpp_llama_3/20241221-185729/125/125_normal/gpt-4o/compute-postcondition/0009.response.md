The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` lists with elements from `lst` distributed cyclically.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists with elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner.**
