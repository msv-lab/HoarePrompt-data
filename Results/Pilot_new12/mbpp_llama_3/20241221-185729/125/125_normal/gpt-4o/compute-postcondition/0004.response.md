To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists where the first list contains the first element of `lst` and the second list contains the second element of `lst`.
- `i` is 1.
- `element` is the second element in the list `lst`.

The code provided is:
```python
result[i % n].append(element)
```

Let's break down what this line does:
- `i % n` calculates the remainder of `i` divided by `n`. Since `i` is 1, this expression will evaluate to 1 (because 1 % n = 1 for any n > 1).
- `result[i % n]` refers to the second list in `result` (since list indices start at 0, and 1 % n = 1 refers to the second element).
- `.append(element)` adds the `element` (which is the second element of `lst`) to the end of the list `result[i % n]`.

However, given that `result` initially contains the first and second elements of `lst` in its first and second lists respectively, and `element` is the second element of `lst`, we're essentially adding the second element of `lst` to the second list in `result`.

So, the second list in `result` will now contain two copies of the second element of `lst`.

The states of `lst`, `n`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. Only the structure of `result` is modified.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where the first list contains the first element of `lst`, the second list contains two instances of the second element of `lst`, and the rest of the lists remain as initially defined, `i` is 1, and `element` is the second element in the list `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where the first list contains the first element of `lst`, the second list contains two instances of the second element of `lst`, and the rest of the lists remain as initially defined, `i` is 1, and `element` is the second element in the list `lst`.**
