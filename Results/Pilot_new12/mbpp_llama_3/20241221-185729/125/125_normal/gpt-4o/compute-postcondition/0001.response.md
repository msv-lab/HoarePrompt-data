According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `element`, and `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer, and `result` is a list of `n` empty lists. 

For the loop to execute, `lst` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0 (the initial index), and `element` is the first element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` empty lists, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in the list**
