Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`. The input list `lst` remains unchanged, and the function handles cases where `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to the length of `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. The function's output is a new list of lists, with no modifications made to the original input list or integer. The cyclic distribution ensures that the first element of `lst` goes to the first sublist, the second element to the second sublist, and so on, wrapping around to the first sublist when the index exceeds `n-1`.**
