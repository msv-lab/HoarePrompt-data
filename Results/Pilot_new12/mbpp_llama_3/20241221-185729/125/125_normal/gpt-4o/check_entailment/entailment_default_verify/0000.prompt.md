You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that splits a list into sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list. 

The code uses list comprehension to create a list of `n` empty sublists. It then iterates over the input list `lst`, appending each element to the corresponding sublist based on its index modulo `n`. This approach ensures that every `n`th element is added to the same sublist.

For example, if `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n` is `2`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`. This is because the elements at indices `0`, `2`, and `4` (which are `1`, `3`, and `5`, respectively) are added to the first sublist, and the elements at indices `1` and `3` (which are `2` and `4`, respectively) are added to the second sublist.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. 

The function correctly handles lists of different lengths, including empty lists, and splits them according to the specified interval `n`. It also works with lists containing elements of different data types. 

Therefore, the code is correct, and the `Correctness` is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where each list contains elements from `lst` distributed in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`. The input list `lst` remains unchanged, and the function handles cases where `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to the length of `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. The function's output is a new list of lists, with no modifications made to the original input list or integer. The cyclic distribution ensures that the first element of `lst` goes to the first sublist, the second element to the second sublist, and so on, wrapping around to the first sublist when the index exceeds `n-1`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
