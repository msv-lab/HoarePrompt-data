Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it splits the list in a cyclic manner based on the index of the elements, not every nth element. 

The problem description asks for a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the provided function distributes the elements of the list into n sublists in a cyclic manner, where the first element of the list goes to the first sublist, the second element to the second sublist, and so on, wrapping around to the first sublist when the index exceeds n-1.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, not `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` which is what the problem description asks for.

To meet the problem description, the function should be implemented as follows:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i+n])
    return result
```
This function splits the list into sublists of length n, where n is the given integer. If the length of the list is not a multiple of n, the last sublist will be shorter than n.
