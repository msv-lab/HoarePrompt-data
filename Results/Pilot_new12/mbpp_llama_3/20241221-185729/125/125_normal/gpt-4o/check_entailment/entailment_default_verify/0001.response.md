The original assessment is accurate because it correctly evaluates the function's behavior based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` indeed splits the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, distributing the elements in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`. The output hints provided further support this assessment, as they describe the same behavior and edge cases that the original assessment considered.

The key points that support the accuracy of the original assessment include:

1. **Correct distribution of elements**: The function correctly distributes the elements of the input list into sublists based on their index modulo `n`, ensuring a cyclic distribution.
2. **Handling of edge cases**: The function correctly handles cases where `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to the length of the input list, as well as the case where the input list is empty.
3. **No modification of input**: The function returns a new list of lists without modifying the original input list or integer.
4. **Compliance with problem description**: The function's behavior matches the problem description, which requires splitting a list into sublists every `n` elements.

The output hints provided do not introduce any new information that would contradict the original assessment. Instead, they reinforce the understanding of the function's behavior and confirm that it aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **True**
