Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` lists. Each of the `n` lists contains elements from `lst` that are at indices `i` where `i % n` equals the index of the list in the result.

2. **Cyclic Distribution**: The program correctly distributes the elements of `lst` in a cyclic manner among the `n` lists based on their original indices modulo `n`. This is achieved using the expression `result[i % n].append(element)` inside the for loop, which appends each element to the list in `result` at an index determined by the current index `i` modulo `n`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid and does not require error handling for cases like an empty list or non-positive integer, the given function will still work correctly for an empty list (it will return a list of `n` empty lists) and for a list with a length that is not a multiple of `n` (it will correctly distribute the elements).

4. **Provided Assert Statements**: The provided assert statements demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs and values of `n`. These statements show that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

In summary, the program correctly splits the input list into `n` lists, distributing the elements in a cyclic manner based on their original indices modulo `n`, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
