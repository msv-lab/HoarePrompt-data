Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes in a list and an integer `n` and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The function works by initializing a list of empty lists with `n` elements. It then iterates over the input list, appending each element to the corresponding list in the result based on its index modulo `n`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles lists of any length and with any value of `n`. The modulus operation (`i % n`) guarantees that the indexing wraps around to the start of the result list when `i` exceeds `n-1`, effectively splitting the input list into `n` parts.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs and values of `n`. Additionally, the function's logic is straightforward and does not contain any obvious edge cases that could lead to incorrect results.

To further verify the function's correctness, consider the following:

- For `n = 1`, the function should return a list containing the original list, which it does.
- For `n` equal to the length of the input list, the function should return a list of lists, each containing one element from the original list, which it does.
- For `n` greater than the length of the input list, the function should return a list of lists, with the first lists containing elements from the original list and the remaining lists empty, which it does.

Since the function's behavior matches the problem description for all potential cases, and no counterexamples can be found, the function is considered correct.
