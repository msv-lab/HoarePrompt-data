Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` splits a list into sublists, distributing elements in a cyclic manner based on their original index modulo `n`. 

For every potential case, the code behaves as expected. If `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to the length of `lst`, the function correctly distributes elements among the sublists. 

The output hints agree with the code, and the function handles cases where `lst` is empty, returning a list of `n` empty lists as expected. 

The function also correctly handles cases where `n` is a positive integer, as assumed in the problem description. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correct behavior of the function for various inputs. The code implementation is straightforward and correctly follows the problem description, so it's reasonable to conclude that it will work correctly for all valid inputs. 

The function uses a list comprehension to create `n` empty sublists and then uses a loop to distribute elements from `lst` among these sublists based on their index modulo `n`. This approach ensures that elements are correctly distributed in a cyclic manner, meeting the requirements of the problem description. 

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs, based on the provided problem description and output hints.
