Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that splits a list into sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list. 

The code uses list comprehension to create a list of `n` empty sublists. It then iterates over the input list `lst`, appending each element to the corresponding sublist based on its index modulo `n`. This approach ensures that every `n`th element is added to the same sublist.

For example, if `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n` is `2`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`. This is because the elements at indices `0`, `2`, and `4` (which are `1`, `3`, and `5`, respectively) are added to the first sublist, and the elements at indices `1` and `3` (which are `2` and `4`, respectively) are added to the second sublist.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. 

The function correctly handles lists of different lengths, including empty lists, and splits them according to the specified interval `n`. It also works with lists containing elements of different data types. 

Therefore, the code is correct, and the `Correctness` is **True**.
