Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the function that splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to distribute the elements of the input list in a cyclic manner among the sublists.

The code correctly handles various cases, including:

* When `n` is greater than, less than, or equal to the length of the input list.
* When the input list is empty, in which case it returns a list of `n` empty lists.
* When the input list has a length that is a multiple of `n`, in which case it returns `n` sublists of equal length.

The output hints provided are consistent with the code's behavior, and the examples given in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code.

For example, the code correctly handles the case when `n` is 3 and the input list is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']`, returning `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`, which is the expected output.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all the potential cases as described in the problem description.
