Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the string. 

This function handles edge cases such as an empty string (''), strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with 'std' at the beginning or end, and strings with 'std' in the middle. It also handles cases where 'std' is not present in the string at all.

The unit tests provided also cover various scenarios, including multiple occurrences, single occurrence, and no occurrence of 'std'. Since the `count()` method is a built-in Python function, it is reliable and efficient for this task. 

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, so the correctness of the program is **True**.
