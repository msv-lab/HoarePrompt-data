Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of the string class to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`. This approach is straightforward and efficient.

The function works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it should work correctly for any potential input. The reason is that the `count` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. Since 'std' is a fixed substring, this method will always return the correct count of its occurrences in the input string.

The function handles edge cases correctly as well, such as an empty string, which returns 0, and strings that contain 'std' zero, one, or multiple times. The function does not have any logical errors or missing edge cases that could cause it to produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
