You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to count the number of occurence of the string 'std' in a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('letstdlenstdporstd') == 3
assert func_1('truststdsolensporsd') == 1
assert func_1('makestdsostdworthit') == 2
assert func_1('stds') == 1
assert func_1('') == 0

def func_1(s: str) -> int:
    return s.count('std')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of the string class to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`. This approach is straightforward and efficient.

The function works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it should work correctly for any potential input. The reason is that the `count` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. Since 'std' is a fixed substring, this method will always return the correct count of its occurrences in the input string.

The function handles edge cases correctly as well, such as an empty string, which returns 0, and strings that contain 'std' zero, one, or multiple times. The function does not have any logical errors or missing edge cases that could cause it to produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. The return value is an integer, which can be 0 if 'std' is not found in `s`, or a positive integer if 'std' appears one or more times in `s`. The function does not modify the input string `s`. All potential edge cases, including an empty string, a string containing 'std' at the beginning, end, or middle, and a string not containing 'std', are handled by returning the correct count. The function also handles cases where 'std' appears multiple times in `s`, counting each occurrence correctly. If `s` is `None`, the function will throw an error, as the `count` method is not defined for `None`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
