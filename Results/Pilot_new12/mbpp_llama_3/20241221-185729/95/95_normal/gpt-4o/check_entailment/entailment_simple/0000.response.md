Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The provided Python function `func_1` does exactly this by using the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring ('std' in this case) in the string `s`.

The function correctly handles different cases, such as an empty string (returning 0), a string containing one or more occurrences of 'std', and a string that does not contain 'std' at all. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.

Since the `count` method is a standard part of the Python string API and is designed to do exactly what the problem description requires, the function `func_1` is a straightforward and correct implementation of the problem description.
