#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the number of occurrences of 'std' in string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. It does not modify the input string `s` and handles all possible input strings, including empty strings and strings without the substring 'std', by returning the correct count of 'std' occurrences. The function covers all potential edge cases, such as strings with multiple consecutive occurrences of 'std', strings with 'std' at the beginning or end, and strings containing only 'std'. It returns 0 if 'std' is not found in the string.
