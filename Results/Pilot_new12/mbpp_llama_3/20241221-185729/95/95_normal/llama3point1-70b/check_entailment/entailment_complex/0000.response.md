Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Counting occurrences**: The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which counts the number of occurrences of the specified value. In this case, it counts the occurrences of 'std' in the string `s`.

2. **Handles edge cases**: Although the program does not explicitly include condition checks for edge cases such as empty strings, strings without 'std', strings with multiple consecutive 'std's, or strings with 'std' at the beginning or end, the `count` method inherently handles these cases correctly. It returns 0 if 'std' is not found, and it correctly counts 'std' occurrences in all other scenarios.

3. **Does not modify input**: The function does not modify the input string `s`. It returns a count of 'std' occurrences without altering `s`.

4. **Returns correct count**: The function will return the correct count of 'std' occurrences in all potential input strings, assuming valid input.

Since the function meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description and handles all potential edge cases, it is correct.
