Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The provided function `func_1(s)` does exactly that by using the built-in `count()` method in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified value.

This method is case-sensitive and will count the occurrences of 'std' as a substring in the string `s`. For example, if the string is 'standardstd', it will return 2, because 'std' appears twice.

Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases or additional requirements, and assuming that the input will always be a valid string, the program correctly implements the required functionality. 

For any given string `s`, `func_1(s)` will return the number of occurrences of 'std', which aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential valid inputs.
