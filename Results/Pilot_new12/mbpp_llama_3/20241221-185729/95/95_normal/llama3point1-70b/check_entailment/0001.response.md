Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string `s`. This is achieved by utilizing the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring.

The function works as expected for various inputs, including:
- Empty strings: `func_1("")` returns 0, which is correct since there are no occurrences of 'std'.
- Strings without 'std': `func_1("hello world")` returns 0, which is correct.
- Strings with one occurrence of 'std': `func_1("std is here")` returns 1, which is correct.
- Strings with multiple occurrences of 'std': `func_1("std std std")` returns 3, which is correct.
- Strings with 'std' as part of other words: `func_1("standardized")` returns 0, which is correct because it counts 'std' as a standalone substring, not part of other words.

The `count` method does not overlap counts, meaning it will not count 'std' twice if 'std' is part of a larger repeated pattern like 'stdstd'. This behavior aligns with typical expectations for such a function. Given that the function behaves as expected in all these scenarios, it appears to be correct according to the problem description.
