To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `nums` has at least two distinct elements.
- `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`.
- The length of `unique_nums` is more than or equal to 2.

Given this, `unique_nums` contains distinct integers from `nums`, and since `nums` has at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` will also have at least two elements.

The code snippet is:
```python
return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
```
This code sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order and then returns the second element (`[1]` because indexing starts at 0).

Since `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums` and has at least two elements, sorting it will arrange these unique integers in ascending order. The second element (`index 1`) will be the second smallest unique integer in `nums`.

Therefore, the program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.**
