The given code creates a new list `unique_nums` containing the unique elements from the list `nums`. This is achieved by converting the list `nums` to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, and then converting it back to a list.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`.**
