Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the second smallest number in a list. The provided function, `func_1`, accomplishes this by first removing duplicate integers from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. It checks if the resulting list of unique numbers has at least two elements. If not, it returns `None`, which is a valid response according to the problem description for cases where the list contains less than two distinct integers.

If the list has at least two distinct integers, the function sorts the unique numbers in ascending order and returns the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest unique integer from the original list. This process correctly identifies the second smallest number regardless of the original order or frequency of the integers in the input list.

The function handles edge cases where the input list may contain duplicate integers or integers that are not distinct, and it correctly identifies the second smallest unique integer in such cases. The function's output is determined solely by the unique integers present in the input list, which aligns with the problem description's requirements.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program (e.g., the input will always be a non-empty list of integers), the function operates within the expected constraints and provides the correct output for every potential valid case. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
