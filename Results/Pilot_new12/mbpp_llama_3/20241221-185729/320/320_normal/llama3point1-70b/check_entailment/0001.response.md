Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the second smallest number in the list. If the list contains less than two unique numbers, the function returns `None`.

Here's why the code is correct:

*   The program first removes duplicates from the input list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. This ensures that the function only considers unique numbers.
*   It checks if the length of the set is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None` because there is no second smallest number.
*   If the set has at least two elements, the function sorts the unique numbers in ascending order and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`), which is the second smallest number.

The code handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with duplicate elements correctly. For example:

*   If the input list is `[5, 5, 5]`, the function will return `None` because there is only one unique number.
*   If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `2`, which is the second smallest number.
*   If the input list is `[]`, the function will return `None` because the list is empty.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
