Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. It first removes duplicates from the input list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. This ensures that it only considers unique integers.
2. If the resulting list of unique integers has less than 2 elements, it returns `None`, which aligns with the problem description.
3. Otherwise, it sorts the list of unique integers and returns the second element (at index 1), which is the second smallest unique integer.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional insight into its behavior. The function handles edge cases, such as duplicate integers or non-distinct integers, correctly. The hints also clarify that the function's output is determined solely by the unique integers in the input list, regardless of their original order or frequency.

Given the assumed valid input, the code works as expected and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
