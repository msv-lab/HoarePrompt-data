Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then back to a list, storing it in `unique_nums`.
2. It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number in the list (since there are less than two distinct elements).
3. If the length of `unique_nums` is 2 or more, the function sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order and returns the second element, which is the second smallest unique integer in the list.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list has less than two distinct elements by returning `None`. For lists with at least two distinct elements, it correctly identifies and returns the second smallest unique integer.

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements) holds, and the program's behavior is correct under these assumptions. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
