Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Handling Duplicate Integers**: The function first converts the input list to a set (`unique_nums = list(set(nums))`), which automatically removes any duplicate integers. This is in line with the problem description and the output hints, which state that the function operates based on unique integers.

2. **Checking for Less Than Two Distinct Integers**: It checks if there are less than two unique integers (`if len(unique_nums) < 2`), and if so, it returns `None`. This matches the output hints and the problem description.

3. **Sorting and Returning the Second Smallest**: If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts them (`sorted(unique_nums)`) and returns the second element (`[1]`), which corresponds to the second smallest number. This directly addresses the problem's requirement to find the second smallest number in the list.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is designed to handle lists with duplicate integers or integers that are not distinct and correctly identifies the second smallest unique integer. It does not rely on the original order or frequency of integers, which aligns with the output hints.

5. **Assuming Valid Input**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers), the function does not need to include error checking code for invalid inputs such as an empty list, non-integer values, or non-list inputs.

Considering these points, the function `func_1` accurately implements the described behavior for finding the second smallest unique integer in a list, making it correct for every potential case under the provided assumptions.
