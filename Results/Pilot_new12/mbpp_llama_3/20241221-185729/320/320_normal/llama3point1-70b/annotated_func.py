#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is more than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns either `None` or the second smallest unique integer from the list. If the list contains less than two distinct integers, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest unique integer. The function handles edge cases where the input list may contain duplicate integers or integers that are not distinct, and it correctly identifies the second smallest unique integer in such cases. The function's output is determined solely by the unique integers present in the input list, regardless of their original order or frequency.
