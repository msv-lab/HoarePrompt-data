The code `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` creates a new sorted list `unique_nums` containing the distinct elements from the list `nums`. The `set(nums)` expression removes duplicate elements from `nums` (although `nums` is already stated to contain distinct integers, this operation does not change the fact), and `sorted()` sorts these unique elements in ascending order.

Given that `nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, the set of `nums` will be the same as `nums` itself because `nums` already contains distinct integers. Therefore, `unique_nums` will be a sorted version of `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is a sorted list of the integers in `nums`.**
