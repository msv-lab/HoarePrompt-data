The given code checks if the length of `unique_nums` is more than 1. Since `nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, and `unique_nums` is a sorted list of the integers in `nums`, `unique_nums` will also have at least two elements. Therefore, the condition `len(unique_nums) > 1` will always be true. 

As a result, the program will return `unique_nums[1]`, which is the second smallest integer in the sorted list `unique_nums`. 

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest integer in the sorted list of distinct integers from `nums`.**
