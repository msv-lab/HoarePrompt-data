You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list. If the list has less than two unique elements, the function returns `None`.

Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. The code first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set, which only contains unique elements. It then sorts this set of unique numbers in ascending order.
2. If the length of the sorted set of unique numbers is more than 1, it returns the second element (at index 1), which is the second smallest number in the list.
3. If the length of the sorted set of unique numbers is 1 or less, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number in the list.

I couldn't find any potential case where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, lists with negative numbers, lists with floating point numbers, and lists with less than two unique elements.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code, covering various scenarios such as lists with multiple unique elements, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with less than two unique elements. Overall, the code seems to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, sorts the unique integers in ascending order, and returns the second smallest integer if there are at least two unique integers. If there is only one unique integer or the input list is empty, the function returns None. The function does not modify the original input list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
