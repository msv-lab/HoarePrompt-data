Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order. If there are at least two unique numbers, it returns the second smallest number; otherwise, it returns None.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, demonstrating cases where the list contains multiple unique numbers, duplicate numbers, and only one unique number. The function behaves as expected in all these cases.

There are no edge cases that the code does not handle, given the assumption that the input will always be a valid list of numbers. The function correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers, negative numbers, and floating-point numbers. It also correctly returns None when there is only one unique number or when the input list is empty.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1([2, 2])` returns None because there is only one unique number, and `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` returns -2, which is the second smallest number in the list.

Therefore, the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
