Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list. If the list has less than two unique elements, the function returns `None`.

Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. The code first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set, which only contains unique elements. It then sorts this set of unique numbers in ascending order.
2. If the length of the sorted set of unique numbers is more than 1, it returns the second element (at index 1), which is the second smallest number in the list.
3. If the length of the sorted set of unique numbers is 1 or less, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number in the list.

I couldn't find any potential case where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, lists with negative numbers, lists with floating point numbers, and lists with less than two unique elements.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code, covering various scenarios such as lists with multiple unique elements, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with less than two unique elements. Overall, the code seems to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
