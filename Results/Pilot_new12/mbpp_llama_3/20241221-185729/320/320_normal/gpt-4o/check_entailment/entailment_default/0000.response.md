Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that finds the second smallest number in a list of numbers. The function first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set, then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order. If there are at least two unique numbers, it returns the second smallest number; otherwise, it returns `None`.

The code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers, lists with less than two unique numbers, and empty lists. The function does not modify the original input list, as stated in the output hints.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:

- `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2` returns the second smallest number, which is -2.
- `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5` returns the second smallest number, which is -0.5.
- `func_1([2, 2]) == None` returns `None` because there is only one unique number in the list.
- `func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None` also returns `None` for the same reason.

Overall, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as expected.
