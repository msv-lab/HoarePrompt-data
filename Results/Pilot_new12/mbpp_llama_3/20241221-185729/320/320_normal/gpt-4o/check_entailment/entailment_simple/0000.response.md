Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers `nums` as input.
2. It converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the resulting set in ascending order, storing the result in `unique_nums`.
3. The function then returns the second smallest number in the sorted list `unique_nums` if there are at least two unique numbers. If there is only one unique number, it returns `None`.
4. The use of `set` ensures that duplicate numbers are removed, and the `sorted` function ensures that the remaining unique numbers are in ascending order.
5. The index `1` in `unique_nums[1]` correctly accesses the second smallest number because list indices in Python start at 0.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one unique number in the list, in which case it returns `None`. 

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the program, covering various scenarios, including lists with negative numbers, duplicate numbers, and lists with only two elements. 

Overall, the program accurately implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list as specified in the problem description.
