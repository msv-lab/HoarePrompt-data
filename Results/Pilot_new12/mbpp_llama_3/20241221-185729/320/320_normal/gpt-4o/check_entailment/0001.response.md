Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. The program first creates a set of unique numbers from the input list using `set(nums)`. This is necessary to handle duplicate numbers in the list.
2. It then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order using `sorted()`.
3. If the list has more than one unique number, it returns the second smallest number using `unique_nums[1]`.
4. If the list has only one unique number (i.e., all numbers are the same), it returns `None`, which is a reasonable output since there is no second smallest number in this case.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness:

- The test case `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` returns `-2`, which is the second smallest number in the list.
- The test case `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])` returns `-0.5`, which is the second smallest number in the list.
- The test cases `func_1([2, 2])` and `func_1([2, 2, 2])` return `None`, which is correct because there is no second smallest number in these lists.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
