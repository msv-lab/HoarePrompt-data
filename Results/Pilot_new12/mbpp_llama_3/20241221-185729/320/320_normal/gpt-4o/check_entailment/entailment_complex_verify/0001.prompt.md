You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. The program first creates a set of unique numbers from the input list using `set(nums)`. This is necessary to handle duplicate numbers in the list.
2. It then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order using `sorted()`.
3. If the list has more than one unique number, it returns the second smallest number using `unique_nums[1]`.
4. If the list has only one unique number (i.e., all numbers are the same), it returns `None`, which is a reasonable output since there is no second smallest number in this case.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness:

- The test case `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` returns `-2`, which is the second smallest number in the list.
- The test case `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])` returns `-0.5`, which is the second smallest number in the list.
- The test cases `func_1([2, 2])` and `func_1([2, 2, 2])` return `None`, which is correct because there is no second smallest number in these lists.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second smallest integer in the sorted list of distinct integers from `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, sorts the unique integers in ascending order, and returns the second smallest integer if there are at least two unique integers. If there is only one unique integer or the input list is empty, the function returns None. The function does not modify the original input list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
