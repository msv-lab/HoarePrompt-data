Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the problem description as it correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. 

Here's why it works:

- The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input.
- It removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
- If there are at least two unique numbers, it returns the second smallest number by indexing into the sorted list of unique numbers (`unique_nums[1]`).
- If there is only one unique number, it returns `None`.

The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description:

- It handles lists with multiple unique numbers and returns the second smallest number.
- It handles lists with only one unique number and returns `None`.
- It handles lists with duplicate numbers by removing duplicates before finding the second smallest number.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program for various input scenarios. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
