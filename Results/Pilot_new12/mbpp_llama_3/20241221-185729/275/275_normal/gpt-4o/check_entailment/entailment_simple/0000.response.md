Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.
2. The program first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the program returns 0, which is the correct answer because an empty list has no subsets.
3. If the list is not empty, the program sorts the list in ascending order. This is a necessary step to ensure that the divisibility checks are performed correctly.
4. The program then initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with the same length as the input list. Each element in the DP array represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at the corresponding index in the sorted list.
5. The program then iterates over the sorted list and for each element, it checks all previous elements to see if the current element is divisible by any of them. If it is, the program updates the DP array to reflect the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at the current index.
6. Finally, the program returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. For example, if the input list contains only one element, the program returns 1, which is the correct answer because a single-element list is a valid subset. If the input list contains multiple elements, the program correctly identifies the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness. For example, the test case `assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4` shows that the program correctly returns the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible, which is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
