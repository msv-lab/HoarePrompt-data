Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it only considers the divisibility of each number by the previous numbers in the sequence, but it does not consider all possible subsets of the input list.

The problem description states that the function should find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. However, the program only checks for divisibility between consecutive numbers in the sorted list, and it does not consider other possible subsets that may have every pair divisible.

For example, consider the input list [2, 4, 6, 12]. The program will return 4, which is correct. However, if we consider the input list [2, 4, 8, 12], the program will return 2, because it only considers the divisibility between consecutive numbers (2 and 4, and 4 and 8), but it does not consider the subset [2, 4, 12] or [4, 8, 12] or [2, 8, 12] which does not meet the condition, but [2, 4, 12] meets the condition.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible subsets of the input list and returning the size of the largest subset that meets the condition.

However, the annotated program provided does not do this. It only checks for divisibility between consecutive numbers in the sorted list, which is not sufficient to meet the problem description.

To fix this issue, we would need to modify the program to check all possible subsets of the input list, not just consecutive numbers. This could be done using a different algorithm, such as generating all possible subsets of the input list and checking each one to see if every pair is divisible. 

Here is a simple example of how it could be done:

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

def func_1(nums):
    def all_pairs_divisible(subset):
        for i in range(len(subset)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(subset)):
                if subset[i] % subset[j]!= 0 and subset[j] % subset[i]!= 0:
                    return False
        return True

    subsets = list(chain(*map(lambda x: combinations(nums, x), range(0, len(nums)+1))))
    max_length = 0
    for subset in subsets:
        if all_pairs_divisible(subset):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(subset))

    return max_length
```
This code generates all possible subsets of the input list and checks each one to see if every pair is divisible. It keeps track of the maximum length of a subset that meets this condition and returns it as the result.
