You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible. This is achieved through dynamic programming, where the program iterates over the sorted list of numbers and for each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by the previous one. If it is, the program updates the maximum subset size for the current number.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Sorting**: The program starts by sorting the input list of numbers. This is crucial because it ensures that smaller numbers come before larger ones, allowing the program to efficiently check for divisibility.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: The program uses a DP array (`dp`) where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i` such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. The program initializes `dp` with all elements as 1, meaning each number forms a subset of size 1.

3. **Checking Divisibility**: For each number at index `i`, the program checks all previous numbers (`j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`). If the current number (`nums[i]`) is divisible by a previous number (`nums[j]`), it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This effectively extends the subset ending at `j` by including the number at `i`, if such an extension is possible and increases the subset size.

4. **Returning the Maximum Subset Size**: After filling up the `dp` array, the program returns the maximum value in `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the program, demonstrating its ability to handle different input scenarios.

Given the above explanation and the absence of any found counterexamples, it's reasonable to conclude that the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` equals the length of `nums` minus 1. If `nums` has only one element, `dp` is a list with a single element, which is 1.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list 'nums'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
