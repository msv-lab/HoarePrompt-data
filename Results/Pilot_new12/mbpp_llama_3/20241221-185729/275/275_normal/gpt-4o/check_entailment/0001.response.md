Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. 

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:
- It first checks if the input list is empty and returns 0 in that case, which is correct because an empty list cannot have a divisible subset.
- It then sorts the list, which does not affect the divisibility of pairs but helps in the subsequent dynamic programming steps.
- The dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to build up a table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at `nums[i]`.
- For each `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This ensures that `dp[i]` always represents the size of the largest subset ending at `nums[i]`.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

All the provided test cases seem to work correctly with this function, and there are no immediately apparent edge cases that the code does not handle. Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided test cases, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
