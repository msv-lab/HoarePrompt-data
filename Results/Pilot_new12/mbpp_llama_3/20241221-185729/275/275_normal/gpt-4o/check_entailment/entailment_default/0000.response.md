Correctness: **True**

The code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It sorts the input list in ascending order and uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers. The function correctly handles empty input lists, lists with one element, and lists where no sequence of divisible numbers can be found. 

The dynamic programming approach used in the code ensures that it considers all possible sequences of divisible numbers in the sorted list, and it returns the length of the longest sequence found. The code also correctly modifies the original list to be sorted in ascending order if it was not empty, as hinted in the output hints.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the code works as expected for different input cases. 

The function assumes that the input will be a list of integers, as stated in the problem description. If the input is not a list or is an empty list, the function will still work correctly, returning 0 in the case of an empty list, but as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid. 

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and unit tests, the code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
