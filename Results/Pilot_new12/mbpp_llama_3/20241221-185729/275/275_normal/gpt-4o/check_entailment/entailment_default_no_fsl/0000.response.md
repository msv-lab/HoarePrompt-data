Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that determines the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. The function sorts the input list in ascending order and utilizes dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at index `i`. It iterates over the sorted list, updating `dp[i]` whenever it finds a number at index `j` that divides the number at index `i`, and returns the maximum value in `dp`.

The provided output hints and the function's implementation align with the problem description. The function correctly handles the edge cases, such as an empty input list (returning 0) and a list with a single element (returning 1). The dynamic programming approach allows the function to efficiently find the longest sequence of divisible numbers.

The given unit tests also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function produces the expected results.

Overall, the code seems to correctly solve the problem, and there are no apparent cases where it fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
