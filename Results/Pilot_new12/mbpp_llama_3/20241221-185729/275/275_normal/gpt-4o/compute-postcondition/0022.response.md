To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop: `for j in range(i):`

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before.
- `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.

For the loop `for j in range(i):` to execute one more time, it means we are looking at the next iteration of the outer loop that controls `i`, because `j` iterates over the range of `i`. Thus, when we move to the next iteration of the outer loop (which increments `i`), the inner loop (controlled by `j`) will start again from 0 up to the new value of `i`.

At the start of the next iteration of the outer loop:
- `nums` still is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and because we are considering the next iteration, it implies `nums` could potentially have another element or it's being processed further.
- `dp` still represents the lengths of the longest sequences of divisible numbers ending at each `nums[i]`, but its values may need update based on the new `nums` or the iteration process.
- `i` has increased by 1 because we're moving to the next element in `nums` for processing. So, if `i` was greater than 0 before, now it's even greater.
- `j` starts over from 0 because it iterates over `range(i)`, and with `i` increased, `j` has more values to iterate through up to the new `i`.

Considering these adjustments for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than its previous value, `j` is 0**
