The code creates a new list `dp` and assigns it a value of a list of 1s, where the number of 1s is equal to the length of `nums`. The state of `nums` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`**
