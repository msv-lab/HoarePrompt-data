According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `nums` is already stated to be not empty, we can confirm that the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, and `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 0**
