Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, then `dp` is a list where the value at index `i` is 2 and all other values are 1. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged with all values being 1.***
