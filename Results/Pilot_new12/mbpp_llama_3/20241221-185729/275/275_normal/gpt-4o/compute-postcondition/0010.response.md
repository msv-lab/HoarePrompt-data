According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. If `j` is less than `i-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The state of `nums` remains unchanged as it is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty. The state of `i` also remains unchanged as it is greater than 0. The state of `dp` depends on the condition `if nums[i] is a multiple of nums[j]`, but since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we cannot determine the exact state of `dp` without knowing the values of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. However, we can say that `dp` is a list where all values are initially 1, and the value at index `i` may be 2 if the condition is met.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dp` is a list where all values are initially 1, and the value at index `i` may be 2 if `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`**
