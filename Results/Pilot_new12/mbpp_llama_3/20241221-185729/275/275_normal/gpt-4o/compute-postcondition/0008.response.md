The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` is a list of 1s initially, `dp[j]` is 1. Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 1) and 2.

The new value of `dp[i]` is 2, because `dp[i]` is initially 1 and `dp[j] + 1` is 2, and 2 is greater than 1. 

Other variables are not affected by this code. So, `nums` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list where the value at index `i` is 2 and all other values are 1, `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. Also, `nums[i]` is still a multiple of `nums[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list where the value at index `i` is 2 and all other values are 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`.**
