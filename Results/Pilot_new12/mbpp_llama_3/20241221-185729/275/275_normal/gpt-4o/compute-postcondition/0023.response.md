`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, this update indicates that if a longer sequence ending at `nums[i]` is found by extending a sequence that ends at `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to reflect this longer sequence. 

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is updated based on the divisibility relationships between the numbers in `nums`. The update does not change the fact that `nums` is sorted or that `i` is greater than its previous value, nor does it change `j` being 0. 

The state of `dp` is updated specifically at index `i`, now holding the maximum length of a sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, considering sequences that can be extended from `nums[j]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]` considering possible extensions from previous elements like `nums[j]`, `i` is greater than its previous value, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is updated where `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is greater than its previous value, `j` is 0**
