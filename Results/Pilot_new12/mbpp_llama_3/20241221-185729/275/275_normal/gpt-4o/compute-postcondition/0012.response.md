Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, if `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value (1 or 2) and 2, and all other values in `dp` remain unchanged; otherwise, the state of `nums`, `i`, `j`, and `dp` remains unchanged, with `dp` being a list where all values are initially 1, and the value at index `i` may be 2 if the condition was met before this check***
