To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information and the loop condition.

Given:
- `nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`.
- `j` is 0.

The loop condition is `for j in range(i):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. Since `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `nums` but greater than its current value (0) since it has already executed at least once.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop condition directly.
- `dp` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop condition directly.
- `i` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop; it represents the length of `nums`, which does not change.
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 up to but not including `i`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1, and `i` remains the same as it is the limit of the loop. The condition regarding divisibility and the update of `dp` is part of the loop body and does not influence the condition for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 1**
