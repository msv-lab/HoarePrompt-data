Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is at least 2 and other values in `dp` are as previously set, with `dp[2]` being 1 unless previously updated. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, then the state of `dp` and other variables remains unchanged.***
