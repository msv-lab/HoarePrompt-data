Postcondition: ***`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 1, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the state of the program remains unchanged with `nums[i]` being a multiple of `nums[j]`.***
