According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0 (and also greater than 1 because `j` is 1). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and `i` remains greater than 0 (and also greater than 2 because `j` is 2). The state of `nums` and `dp` remains unchanged because the loop body is not executed yet.
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `dp` is a list where all values are initially 1, and the value at index `i` may be 2 if the condition was met before this check**
