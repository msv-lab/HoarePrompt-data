The code attempts to update the value of `dp[i]`. However, since `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, it is out of range for the list `dp`. 

In Python, list indices range from 0 to length - 1. Therefore, trying to access `dp[i]` when `i` is equal to the length of `nums` would result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception.

However, assuming that this code is part of a larger loop and `i` is not always equal to the length of `nums`, let's analyze the impact of this line on the program.

The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is 2, this means that `dp[i]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[2]`.

However, in the given initial state, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`. Therefore, the code will throw an error.

Let's assume that the initial state was different, and `i` was a valid index for `dp`. In that case, the output state would be: 
`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]` and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its old value and `dp[2] + 1`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 2.

But since `i` is not a valid index, we can't update `dp[i]`. 

So, we assume that the code does not execute due to the index error, and therefore the state of the variables does not change.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 2, and an IndexError occurs**
