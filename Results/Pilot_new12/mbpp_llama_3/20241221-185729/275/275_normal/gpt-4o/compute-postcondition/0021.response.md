Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0.***
