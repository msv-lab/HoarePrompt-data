`dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. The value of `nums[i]` being divisible by `nums[j]` is not explicitly checked in this code snippet, but based on the initial state, it is mentioned that `dp` is updated under this condition. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, the output state will reflect the update of `dp[i]` based on the divisibility condition mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
