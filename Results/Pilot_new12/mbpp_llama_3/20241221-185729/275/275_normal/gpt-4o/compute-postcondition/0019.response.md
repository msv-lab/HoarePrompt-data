Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is a list with at least one more element than before where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` modulo `nums[j]` equals 0**
