To determine the state at the start of the for loop, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The given state is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 0.

The for loop statement is: `for j in range(i):`

For this loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because `range(i)` will generate numbers from 0 to `i-1`. If `i` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

However, given that `i` is initially 0, we need to adjust this state for the loop to potentially execute. Since the loop iterates over `range(i)`, for any iteration to occur, `i` must be at least 1.

Additionally, `j` is introduced in the loop, which will take values from 0 to `i-1`. Thus, at the start of the loop, `j` would be 0 if the loop were to execute.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
