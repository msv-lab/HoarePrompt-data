Postcondition: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` modulo `nums[j]` equals 0.**
