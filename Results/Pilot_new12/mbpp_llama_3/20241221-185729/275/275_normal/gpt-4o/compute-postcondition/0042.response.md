To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, and `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`. The variable `i` equals the length of `nums` minus 1, indicating it points to the last index of the list `nums`. If `nums` has only one element, `dp` is a list with a single element, which is 1.

Given the return statement `return max(dp)`, we are looking to find the maximum value within the `dp` list. Since `dp` contains lengths of the longest sequences of divisible numbers ending at each position in `nums`, the maximum value in `dp` would represent the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers found in the list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list 'nums'.**
