According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, which means the loop will execute as long as `nums` is not empty. So for the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0, which implies `nums` must have at least 1 element, and `j` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 0**
