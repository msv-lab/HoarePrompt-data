To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i)`. This means that the loop will iterate over all indices from 0 to `i-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, but since the loop iterates over the range of `i`, we actually need to consider the value of `i` and how `j` relates to it.

Since `j` is currently 1, and we are considering the next iteration, we should think about how the loop progresses. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

However, given that `i` is the length of `nums`, which means it's already at the end of the list, the next iteration of the outer loop (not shown in the snippet) would typically involve incrementing or changing the value of `i` or the state of `nums` or `dp` in some way to make the inner loop (`for j in range(i)`) execute again with different parameters.

But, focusing strictly on the provided loop and the fact that `i` equals the length of `nums`, for the loop `for j in range(i)` to execute one more time with a different value of `j`, we consider what happens at the end of an iteration and the start of the next. 

Given `j` is 1, and we're looking at the next iteration, `j` would naturally increment to 2 because it's the next value in the sequence generated by `range(i)`. However, the crux here is understanding that the loop's ability to execute again doesn't directly depend on `nums` or `dp` but rather on the range defined by `i`.

So, considering the incrementation of `j` and the conditions provided:
- `nums` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` remains a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is still equal to the length of `nums`, because the loop in question (`for j in range(i)`) doesn't change `i`; it changes `j`.
- `j` increments by 1, so it becomes 2.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 2**
