The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` modulo `nums[j]` equals 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`nums` is still a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is still a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is still greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is still 0.
The value of `dp[i]` becomes the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.
Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
