According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1, but since `i` is already at the end of the list, this iteration is the last one. However, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration if it were to happen, we should consider what would happen if `nums` had more elements.

If `nums` had more elements, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be equal to the previous length of `nums`. Since `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, if `nums` had more elements, `dp` would also need to have more elements to accommodate the longer list of numbers.

Since we are tasked with determining the state at the start of the next iteration, and we know that `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least one more element than it did previously. This means `i` would be equal to the previous length of `nums`, and `dp` would need to have an additional element to accommodate the new number in `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is a list with at least one more element than before where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is equal to the previous length of `nums`**
