Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `i` is greater than its previous value, `j` is 0, and `dp` is updated such that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`***
