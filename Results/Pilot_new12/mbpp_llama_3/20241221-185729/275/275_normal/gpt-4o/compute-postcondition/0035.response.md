To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given code and its impact on the variables. The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`.
- `j` is 1.

The code tries to update `dp[i]`, but given that `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, this will result in an "IndexError" because list indices in Python go from 0 to length - 1. However, based on the task's requirements to simulate the execution and provide the output state as if the operation were valid, we will consider the logical impact of the operation.

Since `i` equals the length of `nums`, it's not a valid index for `dp` or `nums`. Thus, we can't directly apply the operation as intended. However, considering the purpose of the task is to understand the impact on variable states, we recognize that the actual intention might have been to use a valid index for `dp` and `nums`.

Assuming a typographical error and the intention was to use a valid index for `dp`, the impact of the code is on `dp[i]`, which would be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is 1. 

However, since `i` is not a valid index (as it equals the length of `nums`), the most accurate interpretation under the constraints given is that the code as presented does not directly alter the state of `dp`, `nums`, `i`, or `j` in a meaningful way due to the indexing issue. The variable `dp[i]` cannot be updated because `i` is out of range for `dp`.

Thus, considering the direct interpretation of the given code and the initial state, the output state remains:
- `nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, but no actual update can occur due to the indexing error.
- `i` is greater than 0 and equal to the length of `nums`.
- `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, `j` is 1**
