According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, and `dp` is a list with at least one more element than before where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is equal to the previous length of `nums`. For the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 0 at the start of the loop. 
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `dp` is a list with at least one more element than before where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
