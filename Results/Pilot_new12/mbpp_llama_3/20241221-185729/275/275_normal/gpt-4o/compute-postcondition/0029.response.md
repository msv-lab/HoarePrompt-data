According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, but since `i` is already at the last index, the loop will not execute again. However, to follow the format and provide a state, we consider what would be the state if the loop were to execute one more time, even though it won't due to the condition. 

In this case, `i` should be equal to the length of `nums`, which means it has gone beyond the bounds of `nums`. However, considering the adjustment for the sake of understanding the task: if the loop were to execute one more time, `nums` remains the same as it's not modified by the loop iteration condition, `dp` would also remain the same as its modification depends on the loop body which is not provided, and `i` would be equal to the length of `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is equal to the length of `nums`**
