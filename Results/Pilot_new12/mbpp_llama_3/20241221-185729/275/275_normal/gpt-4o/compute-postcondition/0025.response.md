To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `i` is greater than its previous value, `j` is 0, and `dp` is updated.

Since the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0, we need to make sure that `i` is indeed greater than 0 for the next iteration. 

Also, since the loop counter `j` is in the range of `i`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0. As `j` is currently 0, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element than before, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `dp` is updated such that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`**
