#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0

        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list where each value at index `i` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` equals the length of `nums` minus 1. If `nums` has only one element, `dp` is a list with a single element, which is 1.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, sorts the list in ascending order if it is not empty, and returns either 0 (if the input list is empty) or the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list. The function considers a sequence of divisible numbers to be a series of numbers where each number is divisible by the previous number in the sequence. If the input list contains only one element, or if no sequence of divisible numbers can be found, the function returns the length of the longest sequence found, which will be at least 1. The state of the input list after the function call is that the original list has been modified to be sorted in ascending order if it was not empty, and the function returns an integer value representing the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers.
