The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, this update reflects the possibility of extending the sequence ending at `j` by adding the element at `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its old value and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 0, and `nums[i]` modulo `nums[j]` equals 0.**
