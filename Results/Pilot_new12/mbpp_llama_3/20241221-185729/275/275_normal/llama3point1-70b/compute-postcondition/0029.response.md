According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. The loop starts from 1 and goes up to the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop goes up to `len(nums)`, for it to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows: `i` is incremented by 1, `nums` must still be a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the new `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums`**
