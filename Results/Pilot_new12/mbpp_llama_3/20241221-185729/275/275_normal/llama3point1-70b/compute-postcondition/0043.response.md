The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. The function returns a value based on the input list. If a certain condition is met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest sequence in the sorted list `nums` where each element is divisible by the previous one. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either 0 or the length of the longest divisible sequence in the sorted list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums`, returns either 0 or the length of the longest sequence where each element is divisible by the previous one in the sorted list.**
