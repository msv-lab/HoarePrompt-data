To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state.

Given loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Initial state:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.

For the loop `for j in range(i):` to execute, it depends on the value of `i`. Since `range(i)` generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `i`, the loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0.

Given that `i` is initially 1, which is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the initial state does not need adjustment for `i` to make the loop executable, as `i` being 1 already satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

However, to accurately describe the state at the start of the loop considering the loop's dependency:
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `dp` remains a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1.
- `i` is 1, which is sufficient for the loop to execute because `range(1)` will generate the number 0, allowing the loop to run once.
- `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop since `range(1)` generates the sequence 0.

Thus, considering the loop's execution, the state adjustments focus on ensuring that the loop can execute based on its defined conditions, which in this case, it can since `i` is greater than 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
