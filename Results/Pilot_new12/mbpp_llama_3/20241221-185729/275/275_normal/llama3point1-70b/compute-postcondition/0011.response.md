The value of `dp[i]` becomes the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, `dp[2]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp` is a list where `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements in `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp` is a list where `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + 1**
