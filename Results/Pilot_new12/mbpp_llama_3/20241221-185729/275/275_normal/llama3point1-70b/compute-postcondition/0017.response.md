According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` should be one more than the length of `nums` for the loop to not execute again, but for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` must be greater than `i`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be equal to the length of `nums`, but `nums` should have at least one more element so the length of `nums` is greater than `i`. Then `i` should be equal to the length of `nums` minus one, and when it's incremented, it will be equal to the length of `nums` which is less than the new length of `nums`. However, considering `i` equals the length of `nums`, for `i` to be less than the length of `nums`, `nums` must have at least one more element. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, and `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`**
