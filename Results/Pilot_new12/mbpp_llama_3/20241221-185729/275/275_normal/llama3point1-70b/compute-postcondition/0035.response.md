To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus one. This implies that the length of the longest sequence where each element is divisible by the previous one, up to the current position `i`, is being updated based on the information available at position `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`.
- `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.

The code affects `dp[i]` by potentially increasing its value based on `dp[j]`. Since `j` is 1, `dp[j]` refers to the length of the longest sequence up to the second element in `nums` (considering list indices start at 0). If the element at position `i` in `nums` is divisible by the element at position `j` in `nums`, or if considering the sequence lengths, `dp[i]` could be updated to `dp[j] + 1` if that results in a longer sequence.

The value of `dp[i]` becomes the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is fixed at 1, the update depends on the fixed value of `dp[1]` plus one. The states of `nums`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i` with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its old value and `dp[1] + 1`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i` with `dp[i]` = max(`dp[i]`, `dp[1]` + 1), `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
