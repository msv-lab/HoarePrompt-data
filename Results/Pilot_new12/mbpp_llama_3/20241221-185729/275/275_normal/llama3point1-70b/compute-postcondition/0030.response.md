According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to `i`, and `i` equals the length of the old `nums`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` is now 0 (the initial value for the loop variable).

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
