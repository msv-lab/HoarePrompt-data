To calculate the output state, we first need to consider the impact of the given code on the program and then update the variables accordingly.

The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp` at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp` at index `j` plus 1. This means that if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current value of `dp[i]`, then `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.
- `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Since `dp[i]` initially is 1 and `dp[j]` is also 1, `dp[j] + 1` equals 2. Given that `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, it implies that `dp[i]` should indeed be updated to reflect this relationship, thus `dp[i]` will be updated to 2 because `dp[j] + 1` (which is 2) is greater than its current value (which is 1).

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is now 2, and the rest of the elements are still 1 (since only `dp[i]` where `i` is 1 has been updated).
- `i` is still 1.
- `j` is still 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
