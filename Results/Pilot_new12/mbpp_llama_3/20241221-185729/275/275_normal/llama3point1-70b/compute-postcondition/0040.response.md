To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
From the output states after a few iterations, we can see that:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`.
- `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `j` takes on values from 0 to `i-1` during the iterations.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `j` will have taken on all values in the range `0` to `i-1`. The `if` condition checks whether `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and if so, updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

For each position `i` in `nums`, `dp[i]` will store the length of the longest sequence where each element is divisible by the previous one, ending at `nums[i]`. This is because the loop checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) and updates `dp[i]` if a longer divisible sequence is found.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `i` is 0), `dp` will contain default or uninitialized values, and `nums` will remain unchanged.

Considering these observations, we can conclude that:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`.
- The loop will execute if `i` (the original length of `nums`) is greater than 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, with `dp` initialized accordingly if `i` is 0.**
