The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list of integers `nums` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. The list is not empty, so the sorting operation is valid.

The impact of the code on the program is that the list `nums` is rearranged to be in ascending order.

The Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty**
