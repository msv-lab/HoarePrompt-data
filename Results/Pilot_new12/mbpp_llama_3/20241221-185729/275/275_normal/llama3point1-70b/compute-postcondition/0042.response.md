To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:

1. `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
2. `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`, with `dp[i]` representing the length of the longest such sequence ending at `nums[i]`.
3. The code `return max(dp)` finds the maximum value in the list `dp`.

Given that `dp` represents the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, and considering that `nums` is sorted, the maximum value in `dp` would represent the length of the longest sequence in `nums` where each element is divisible by the previous one.

Therefore, when the code returns `max(dp)`, it returns the length of the longest sequence in the sorted list `nums` where each element is divisible by the previous one.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the longest sequence in the sorted list `nums` where each element is divisible by the previous one.**
