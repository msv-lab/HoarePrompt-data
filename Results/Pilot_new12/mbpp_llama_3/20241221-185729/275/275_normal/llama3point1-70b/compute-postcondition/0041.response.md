To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we'll analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    for j in range(i):
        if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements initially equal to 1, we can infer the following:

1. The loop iterates over `nums` starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element.
2. For each element `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
3. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This effectively keeps track of the longest sequence where each element is divisible by the previous one, ending at `nums[i]`.

From the output states provided for the first few iterations, we can observe that:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`.
- The value of `i` after the loop finishes is not directly relevant to the final state of `nums` and `dp`, but it's clear that `i` will equal the length of `nums` minus 1 after the loop executes, since the loop iterates up to `len(nums)`.

Considering the loop's logic and the initial conditions:

- If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute because the `range(1, len(nums))` will be empty, and `dp` will remain unchanged (all elements equal to 1), which aligns with the logic since an empty list has no sequences.
- If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute, and `dp` will be updated according to the divisibility rules.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`, with `dp[i]` representing the length of the longest such sequence ending at `nums[i]`.**
