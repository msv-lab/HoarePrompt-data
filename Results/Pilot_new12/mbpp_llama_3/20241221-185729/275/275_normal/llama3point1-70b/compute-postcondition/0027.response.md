Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 2, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[2]` plus 1.***
