The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The value of `i` is equal to the length of the old `nums`, which is one less than the length of the new `nums`. The value of `j` is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 2, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its old value and `dp[2] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 2, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, with `dp[i]` = max(`dp[i]`, `dp[2]` + 1)**
