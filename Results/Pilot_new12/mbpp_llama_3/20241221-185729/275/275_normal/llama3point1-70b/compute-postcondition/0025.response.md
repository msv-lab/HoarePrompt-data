To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. **Loop Statement Analysis**: The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`. This means the loop will iterate over all indices from 0 up to but not including `i`. The loop variable `j` will take on the values 0, 1, 2,..., `i-1` in each iteration.

2. **Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element.
   - `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums`, which is one less than the length of the new `nums`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its old value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1 since the loop iterates over the range of `i`.
   - Given that `j` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `i` remains crucial for the loop condition but does not change within the loop itself. It's the upper limit for the loop and is used to determine the range for `j`.
   - `nums` and `dp` are used within the loop body (not shown), but their state adjustments are determined by the operations within the loop body, which we cannot see. However, based on the given information, `nums` having at least one more element and being sorted in ascending order, and `dp` containing sequence lengths, are conditions that would allow the loop to potentially execute again if the divisibility condition is met for the next `j`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next integer value (2 in this case), since the loop iterates over the range defined by `i`.
   - The state of `nums` and `dp` remains as given, with the understanding that `nums` is sorted and has enough elements, and `dp` reflects the divisibility relationships as per the loop body operations.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 2, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one**
