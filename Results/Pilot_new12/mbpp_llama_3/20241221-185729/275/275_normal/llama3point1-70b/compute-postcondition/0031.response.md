Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, the current value of `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums` at index `i` is divisible by the current value of `nums` at index `j`**
