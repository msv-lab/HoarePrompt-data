The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp` at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp` at index `j` plus 1.

Given the initial state, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, and the current value of `nums` at index `i` is divisible by the current value of `nums` at index `j`. 

Since `nums` at index `i` is divisible by `nums` at index `j`, a sequence ending at `i` can be formed by appending `nums` at index `i` to a sequence ending at `j`. 

Therefore, the length of the longest sequence ending at `i` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the longest sequence ending at `j` plus 1.

The value of `dp[i]` becomes `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `nums` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`**
