According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, and `i` equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`. This means `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `j` is 0.
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 0**
