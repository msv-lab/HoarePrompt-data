To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the program state.

The initial state is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty.

The given code is: `dp = [1] * len(nums)`

This line of code creates a new list `dp` where all elements are 1, and the length of this list is equal to the length of `nums`.

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, the length of `nums` is a positive integer. Therefore, `dp` will also be a list of positive length, where all elements are initialized to 1.

The state of `nums` does not change; it remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1**
