Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 2, `j` is 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[2]` plus 1.**
