According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1. This ensures that the loop will execute if `nums` has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed, `i` should be initialized to 1 (the starting index of the range), and `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 1**
