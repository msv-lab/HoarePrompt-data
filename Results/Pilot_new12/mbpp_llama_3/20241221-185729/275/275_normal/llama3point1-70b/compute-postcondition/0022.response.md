To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one.
- `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`.
- `j` is 0.
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its old value and `dp[j] + 1`.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means `j` will iterate over all indices less than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, since the loop will terminate when `j` equals `i`.

State adjustments:
- `nums` remains the same since there is no operation indicating its modification within the loop.
- `dp` remains the same for now, as its update depends on the condition within the loop body, which is not provided.
- `i` remains the same because its value does not change within the loop; it's the upper limit of the loop.
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.

Considering these adjustments and focusing on the loop condition which depends on `i` and the iteration variable `j`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0, so for the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 1**
