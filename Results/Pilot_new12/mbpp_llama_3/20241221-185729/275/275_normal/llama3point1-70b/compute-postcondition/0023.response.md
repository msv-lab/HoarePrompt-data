To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one.
- `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums`, which is one less than the length of the new `nums`.
- `j` is 1.

The code line is:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

This line updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is 1, this essentially checks if adding 1 to the length of the longest sequence ending at index `j` (which is `dp[j]`) is greater than the current length of the longest sequence ending at index `i` (`dp[i]`). If it is, then `dp[i]` is updated to this new, longer sequence length.

Given that `i` equals the length of the old `nums` (and is thus one less than the length of the new `nums`), and considering the properties of `nums` and `dp`, we can conclude:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element.
- `dp` still contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, but `dp[i]` has been updated to potentially reflect a longer sequence.
- `i` is still greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums`.
- `j` is still 1.

The specific change is to `dp[i]`, which now equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`. Since `dp[1]` represents the length of the longest sequence ending at index 1 (which is at least 1 since a single element is a sequence of length 1), `dp[i]` could potentially increase by 1 if `dp[1] + 1` is greater than its previous value.

Therefore, the output state, considering the update to `dp[i]`, is:
Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its old value and `dp[1] + 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums`, `j` is 1**
