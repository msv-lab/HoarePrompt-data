The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `j` is 1. 

When `nums[3]` is divisible by `nums[1]`, `dp[3]` will be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`. However, after executing the given code, `dp[3]` will be updated to `max(dp[3], dp[1] + 1)`. 

Since `dp[3]` is already the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1` when `nums[3]` is divisible by `nums[1]`, the code will not change `dp[3]` when `nums[3]` is divisible by `nums[1]`. 

However, if `nums[3]` is not divisible by `nums[1]`, then `dp[3]` will be updated to `max(dp[3], dp[1] + 1)`, which is `dp[1] + 1` because `dp[3]` was not updated before.

In any case, `dp[i]` (or `dp[3]`) will be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j]` (or `dp[1]`) plus 1.

`nums` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is still 3, `j` is still 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `dp[3]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`**
