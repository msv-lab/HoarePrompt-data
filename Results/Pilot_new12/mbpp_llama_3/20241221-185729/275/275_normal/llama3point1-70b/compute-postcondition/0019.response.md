Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` modulo `nums[j]` equals 0.**
