Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is 2, otherwise the state of `dp` remains unchanged with all elements equal to 1***
