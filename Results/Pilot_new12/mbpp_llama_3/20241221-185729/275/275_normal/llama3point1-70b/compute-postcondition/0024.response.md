Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and has at least one more element, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the old `nums` which is one less than the length of the new `nums`, `j` is 1, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one, with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its old value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
