According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the loop counter `j`. The loop counter `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2 and `i` must be greater than 2 because the loop can only execute if `j` is less than `i`. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
