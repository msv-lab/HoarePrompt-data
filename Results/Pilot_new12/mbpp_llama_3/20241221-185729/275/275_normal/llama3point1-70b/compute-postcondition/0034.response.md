To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for j in range(i)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 0.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**: Since `j` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute, and at the end of the previous iteration `j` is 0, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains the same as it is the loop variable of the outer loop (not shown in this snippet but implied by the context), and its change is not dependent on the inner loop's execution. `nums` and `dp` do not change simply because the loop iterates; their states are updated based on the loop body's operations, which are not detailed here.

4. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted such that `j` is incremented. Since the loop's condition is `j` in `range(i)`, and at the start of the next iteration `j` needs to be 1 (incremented from 0), the adjusted state reflects this change.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position up to the current value of `i`, `i` equals the length of the old `nums` and is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
