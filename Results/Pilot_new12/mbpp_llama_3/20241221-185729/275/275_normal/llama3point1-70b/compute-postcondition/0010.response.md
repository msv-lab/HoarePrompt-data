To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```
State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is 2, otherwise the state of `dp` remains unchanged with all elements equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented because the loop depends on the range of `i`. Since `j` is iterating over the range of `i`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the loop would have covered the range from 0 to 0 (since range(1) generates 0). For the loop to execute again, it implies we are moving to the next iteration of an outer loop (not shown here), which typically would increment `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `nums` remains the same as it's not modified by the loop statement directly.
- `i` needs to be incremented to at least 2 for the loop to have a new iteration, because if `i` remains 1, `j` would still only range over 0, which was the previous state.
- `j` starts over from 0 because it's defined by the range of `i`, and for each new value of `i`, `j` will restart its iteration from 0.
- `dp` would also depend on the new value of `i` and the condition related to `nums`, but given the loop statement doesn't directly modify `dp`, we focus on the conditions that allow the loop to proceed.

Thus, considering `i` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time (with `j` ranging over 0 and 1), and `j` starting over:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`**
