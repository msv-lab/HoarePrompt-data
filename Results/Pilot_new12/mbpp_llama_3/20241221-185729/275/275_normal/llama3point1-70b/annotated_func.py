def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`, with `dp[i]` representing the length of the longest such sequence ending at `nums[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence in the sorted list `nums` where each element is divisible by the previous one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the length of the longest sequence in the sorted list where each element is divisible by the previous one. If the input list `nums` is empty, the function returns 0. The function performs the following actions: it checks if the input list is empty, sorts the list in ascending order if it's not empty, and then calculates the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in the sorted list. The function returns the maximum length found. The potential edge cases considered include an empty input list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements where each element may or may not be divisible by the previous one. The function handles these edge cases by returning 0 for an empty list and by using dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the lengths of the longest sequences for non-empty lists.
