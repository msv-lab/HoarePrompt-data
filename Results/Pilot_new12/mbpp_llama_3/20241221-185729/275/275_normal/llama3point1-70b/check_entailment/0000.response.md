Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is a solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers is divisible. 

The function works by first sorting the input list `nums`. This is done to ensure that for every pair of numbers, the smaller number comes before the larger number. 

Then, it initializes a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`. The DP table is initialized with all ones, meaning that the largest subset ending at any index is at least of size one (the number itself).

The function then iterates over the list from the second number to the last number. For each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the DP table by taking the maximum between the current value and the value of the previous number plus one.

Finally, it returns the maximum value in the DP table, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers such that every pair of numbers is divisible.

This solution correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- The empty list case, where it returns 0.
- The case where all numbers are divisible by each other, where it returns the length of the list.
- The case where no numbers are divisible by each other, where it returns 1.
- The case where the list contains duplicate numbers, where it treats duplicate numbers as different elements in the subset.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list, because it uses two nested loops to iterate over the list. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it uses a DP table of size n. 

So, after analyzing the function, it seems that the code is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
