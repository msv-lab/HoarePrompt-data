You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is a solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers is divisible. 

The function works by first sorting the input list `nums`. This is done to ensure that for every pair of numbers, the smaller number comes before the larger number. 

Then, it initializes a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i`. The DP table is initialized with all ones, meaning that the largest subset ending at any index is at least of size one (the number itself).

The function then iterates over the list from the second number to the last number. For each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the DP table by taking the maximum between the current value and the value of the previous number plus one.

Finally, it returns the maximum value in the DP table, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers such that every pair of numbers is divisible.

This solution correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- The empty list case, where it returns 0.
- The case where all numbers are divisible by each other, where it returns the length of the list.
- The case where no numbers are divisible by each other, where it returns 1.
- The case where the list contains duplicate numbers, where it treats duplicate numbers as different elements in the subset.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list, because it uses two nested loops to iterate over the list. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it uses a DP table of size n. 

So, after analyzing the function, it seems that the code is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest sequences where each element is divisible by the previous one for each position in `nums`, with `dp[i]` representing the length of the longest such sequence ending at `nums[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence in the sorted list `nums` where each element is divisible by the previous one.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
