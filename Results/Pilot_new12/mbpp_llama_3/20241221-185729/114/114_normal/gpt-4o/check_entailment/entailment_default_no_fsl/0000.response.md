Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element `element` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the `element` in the `tup`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which accurately counts the occurrences of the specified element.

The code handles all potential edge cases, including an empty tuple, an element that appears zero times, and an element that appears one or more times in the tuple. The function does not modify the input tuple or element, and it does not handle any exceptions that may occur if the inputs are not of the expected types. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various cases, such as counting occurrences of elements that appear multiple times, counting occurrences of elements that appear zero times, and handling tuples with multiple elements.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function accurately counts the occurrences of the element, regardless of its position or frequency in the tuple, and does not modify the input tuple or element.

Therefore, based on the provided code, unit tests, and output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input.
