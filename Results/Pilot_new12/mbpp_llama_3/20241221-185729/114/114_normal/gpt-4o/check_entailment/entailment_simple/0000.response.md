Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. The problem description requires a function that takes in a tuple and an element, and counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This method is applicable to any type of object that can be compared with the elements in the tuple.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works correctly for different elements and tuples. For example, when the element is not present in the tuple (e.g., `4`), the function returns `0`. When the element is present multiple times (e.g., `10` and `8`), the function returns the correct count.

Since the function uses the `count` method, which is a standard and reliable way to count elements in a tuple, and the unit tests demonstrate its correctness, we can conclude that the program always does what the problem description says. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
