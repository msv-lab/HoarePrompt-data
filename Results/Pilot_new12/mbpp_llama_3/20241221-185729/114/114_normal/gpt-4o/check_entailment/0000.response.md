Correctness: **True**.

The program provided seems to be correct based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input and returns the count of the element in the tuple. It utilizes Python's built-in `count` method for tuples, which accomplishes this task efficiently.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function. For example, when the function is called with the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)` and the element `10`, it correctly returns `3`, which is the number of occurrences of `10` in the tuple. Similarly, it returns `0` for the element `4`, which is not present in the tuple, and `4` for the element `8`, reflecting its occurrences.

The `count` method works by iterating through the tuple and counting the occurrences of the specified element. Since it is a built-in method, it handles edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with a single element, or when the element is not found. 

For any potential case, including but not limited to:
- An empty tuple: `func_1((), 10)` correctly returns `0`.
- A tuple with a single element: `func_1((10,), 10)` correctly returns `1`.
- When the element is not found: `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` correctly returns `0`.
- A tuple with all elements the same: `func_1((10, 10, 10), 10)` correctly returns `3`.

Given that the provided code correctly handles these cases and utilizes a reliable built-in method, it seems to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description without any apparent gaps or errors in handling potential edge cases. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
