Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple and an element, and it returns the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple.

The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This method handles all potential edge cases, including an empty tuple, an element that appears zero times, and an element that appears one or more times in the tuple.

The program's correctness can be verified through the provided unit tests, which demonstrate that the function correctly counts the occurrences of different elements in the tuple. Additionally, the program's documentation provides a clear description of its behavior, including its input parameters, return value, and edge cases.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's lack of error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-tuple inputs or non-comparable elements) does not affect its correctness. Therefore, the program is considered correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple for all valid inputs.
