Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The `count()` method in Python is a built-in method that returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different inputs. The function correctly returns 0 when the element is not found in the tuple, and it correctly counts the occurrences of elements that are present in the tuple.

After examining the code, no potential cases were found where the function does not work as expected. The function handles tuples with duplicate elements, tuples with a single element, and tuples with no occurrences of the specified element. The function also handles cases where the element is not found in the tuple, as demonstrated by the first unit test.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the implementation of the function, it can be concluded that the function is correct and meets the requirements for every potential case.
