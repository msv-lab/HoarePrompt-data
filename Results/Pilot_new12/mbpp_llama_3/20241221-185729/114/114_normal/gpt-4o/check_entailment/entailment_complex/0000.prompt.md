You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and element is any type of object that can be compared with the elements in the tuple.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the number of times the 'element' appears in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element` of any comparable type, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. The function handles all potential edge cases, including an empty tuple, an element that appears zero times, and an element that appears one or more times in the tuple. It accurately counts the occurrences of the element, regardless of its position or frequency in the tuple. The function does not modify the input tuple or element, and it does not handle any exceptions that may occur if the inputs are not of the expected types (e.g., if `tup` is not a tuple or if `element` is not comparable with the elements in `tup`). After the function concludes, the state of the program is updated with the returned count, and the input tuple and element remain unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
