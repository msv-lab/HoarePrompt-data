#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and element is any type of object that can be compared with the elements in the tuple.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the number of times the 'element' appears in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element` of any comparable type, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. The function handles all potential edge cases, including an empty tuple, an element that appears zero times, and an element that appears one or more times in the tuple. It accurately counts the occurrences of the element, regardless of its position or frequency in the tuple. The function does not modify the input tuple or element, and it does not handle any exceptions that may occur if the inputs are not of the expected types (e.g., if `tup` is not a tuple or if `element` is not comparable with the elements in `tup`). After the function concludes, the state of the program is updated with the returned count, and the input tuple and element remain unchanged.
