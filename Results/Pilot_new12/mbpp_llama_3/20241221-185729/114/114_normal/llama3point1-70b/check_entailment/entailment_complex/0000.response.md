Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of the tuple, which counts the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The program description requires the function to:

1. Accept a tuple and an element as input.
2. Return the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple.
3. Handle cases where the tuple is empty or the element is not found.
4. Count duplicate elements that match the specified element.
5. Not modify the input tuple or element.

The program meets all these requirements. It uses the `count` method, which:

* Returns 0 if the element is not found or the tuple is empty.
* Counts duplicate elements correctly.
* Does not modify the input tuple or element.

Since the problem description assumes valid input and does not require error handling for invalid inputs, the program's lack of error handling does not affect its correctness in this context.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, making it correct.
