Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of the given element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The `count` method of Python tuples and lists returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple or list. 

This function handles all potential cases, including:

- When the element is present in the tuple, it correctly returns the number of occurrences.
- When the element is not present in the tuple, it returns 0, as expected.
- When the tuple is empty, it also correctly returns 0, since there are no occurrences of the element.
- It works for elements of any type, including strings, integers, and other types that can be compared for equality.

No case has been found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
