Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it correctly counts the occurrences of `elem` in `tup` using the built-in `count` method of Python tuples. 

This function handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty tuples: `tup.count(elem)` will return 0 if `tup` is empty.
- Tuples with no occurrences of `elem`: `tup.count(elem)` will return 0.
- Tuples with one or more occurrences of `elem`: `tup.count(elem)` will return the correct count.
- Tuples with duplicate elements: `tup.count(elem)` will count each occurrence of `elem`.
- Tuples with different data types: `tup.count(elem)` will work correctly regardless of the data type of `elem` and the elements in `tup`.

Since we couldn't find a single case where the program doesn't work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
