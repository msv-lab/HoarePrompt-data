Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This is achieved by using the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

Here are the reasons why the program is correct:

1. **Input parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Counting occurrences**: The `count` method of the tuple is used to count the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.
3. **Return value**: The function returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, which meets the requirement specified in the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets all the specifications mentioned in the problem description, it is considered correct. Additionally, as per the problem statement, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the program does not need to handle any invalid input cases, such as an empty tuple or an element that cannot be compared with the elements in the tuple.
