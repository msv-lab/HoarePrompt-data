Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This functionality matches the problem description. 

The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element. This method works correctly for tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and for elements of any type that can be compared using the equality operator.

The output hints provide additional details about the function's behavior but do not indicate any discrepancies with the problem description. The hints confirm that the function returns 0 if the tuple is empty or if the element is not found, and that it counts duplicate elements correctly.

Since we assume that the input will be valid, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a tuple or where the element cannot be compared with the tuple elements. Under these assumptions, the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem and output hints. 

The simplicity and use of the built-in `count` method ensure that `func_1` behaves as expected according to the problem description, without any observed edge cases that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
