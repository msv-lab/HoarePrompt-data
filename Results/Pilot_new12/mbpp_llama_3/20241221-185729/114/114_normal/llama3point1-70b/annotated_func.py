#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is any type of object that can be compared with the elements in the tuple.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the number of occurrences of 'elem' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, regardless of the type of `elem` as long as it can be compared with the elements in `tup`. If `tup` is empty or `elem` is not found in `tup`, the function will return 0. If `tup` contains duplicate elements that match `elem`, they will be counted multiple times in the returned count. The function does not modify the input tuple `tup` or the element `elem` in any way, and it does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the comparison of `elem` with the elements in `tup`.
