The function accepts an integer parameter `month` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 30 days. The function considers months with 30 days to be April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), returning `True` for these months and `False` otherwise. The function does not perform any error checking on the input month, so it will return incorrect results if the input month is not an integer between 1 and 12. For all other valid months (January, February, March, May, July, August, October, and December), the function will return `False`. The function does not modify the input `month` parameter and only returns a boolean value based on the month's number of days.
