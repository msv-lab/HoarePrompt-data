To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `month` is an integer ranging from 1 to 12, and `months_with_30_days` is a set containing the months {4, 6, 9, 11}, which are the months in a year that have 30 days.

The code `return month in months_with_30_days` checks if the value of `month` is present in the set `months_with_30_days`. This operation will return a boolean value (True or False) indicating whether the `month` is in the set of months with 30 days.

Given that `month` can be any integer from 1 to 12, and the set `months_with_30_days` contains {4, 6, 9, 11}, the return value will be:

- True if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, because these months have 30 days.
- False if `month` is any other value from 1 to 12 that is not in the set {4, 6, 9, 11}, because those months either have 28, 29, or 31 days.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the month in question has 30 days.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month has 30 days (April, June, September, November), and False otherwise.**
