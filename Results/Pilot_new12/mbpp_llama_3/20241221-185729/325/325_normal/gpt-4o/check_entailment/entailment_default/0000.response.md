Correctness: **False**.

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not handle invalid input. The function does not perform any error checking on the input month, so it will return incorrect results if the input month is not an integer between 1 and 12. For example, if the input month is 0, a negative number, or a number greater than 12, the function will return incorrect results. The function will also return incorrect results if the input month is not an integer, such as a float or a string. 

Although the problem description mentions that the input will be valid, the output hints mention that the function does not perform any error checking on the input month. This indicates that the function is not designed to handle invalid input, and therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

For instance, the function will return `False` for months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) but it will not verify if the month is within the valid range of 1 to 12. If the input is 13, the function will return `False` but this is not as per the problem description which expects the function to identify if a given month has 30 days or not, assuming the month is valid.
