Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not, and it does so by checking if the month number is in the set `months_with_30_days`, which includes the months of April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). These are the only months with 30 days in the Gregorian calendar.

The program correctly returns `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function. The function assumes that the input is a valid month number between 1 and 12, which aligns with the problem description.

There are no cases where the program does not follow the problem description, given the assumption that the input will always be valid and within the specified range. The function is straightforward and correctly implements the required logic.
