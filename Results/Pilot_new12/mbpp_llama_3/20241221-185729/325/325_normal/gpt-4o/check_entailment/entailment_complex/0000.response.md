Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` in the annotated program does exactly this by checking if the input month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, or November) and returning `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers of the months with 30 days, and then checks if the input month is in this set using the `in` operator. This approach ensures that the function returns the correct result for all valid month numbers between 1 and 12.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not an integer between 1 and 12. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
