Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` checks whether a given month number has 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store these month numbers and returns `True` if the input month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests also confirm this:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February has 28 or 29 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because December has 31 days.

The function handles all possible inputs from 1 to 12 correctly, and it is efficient because it uses a set for constant-time lookups. Therefore, it meets the problem description for every potential case, making it a correct solution.
