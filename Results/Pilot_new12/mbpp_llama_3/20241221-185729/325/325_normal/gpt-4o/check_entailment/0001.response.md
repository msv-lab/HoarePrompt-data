Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given month contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and returns `True` if the month has 30 days, and `False` otherwise. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are correctly specified in the `months_with_30_days` set.

The program handles all possible cases from 1 to 12, and the unit tests provided also validate its correctness. The months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and February (which has 28 or 29 days) are correctly identified as not having 30 days.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for checking the number of days in a month and handles all possible cases, it is correct.
