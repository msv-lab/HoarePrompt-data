#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given month has 30 days, specifically checking if the month is April, June, September, or November, and returns True if it is one of these months and False otherwise, effectively categorizing the input month into two groups: months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and months with either 28, 29, or 31 days, covering all 12 months of the year without exceptions or edge cases beyond the basic month validation implied by the input range (1 <= month <= 12).
