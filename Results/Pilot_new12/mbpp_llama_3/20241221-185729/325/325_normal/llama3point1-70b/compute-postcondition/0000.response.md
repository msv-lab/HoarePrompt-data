The given code defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the months with 30 days in a year, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). This list does not modify the value of `month` but provides a reference to the months with 30 days.

The state of `month` is not changed by the code, as it only defines a new list. Therefore, `month` remains an integer between 1 and 12.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12, `thirty_days_months` is a list equal to [4, 6, 9, 11]**
