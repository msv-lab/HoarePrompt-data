To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `month` is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive), and `thirty_days_months` is a list containing the months with 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The code `return month in thirty_days_months` checks if the value of `month` is present in the list `thirty_days_months`. This operation will return a boolean value (`True` or `False`), indicating whether the month has 30 days or not.

Given the possible values of `month` (1 through 12) and the specific months listed in `thirty_days_months` (4, 6, 9, 11), the return value will be `True` if `month` is one of these values and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the month in question has 30 days, based on the month being between 1 and 12 and the specific list of months with 30 days.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November; otherwise, it returns False.**
