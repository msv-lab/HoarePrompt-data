Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks whether a given month contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1(month)` takes the month number as input and returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November (which have 30 days), and `False` otherwise.

The program handles all 12 months of the year without exceptions or edge cases. The months are given as numbers from 1 to 12, and the function correctly checks if the input month is in the list of months with 30 days (`thirty_days_months`).

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to consider cases where the input is not a number between 1 and 12. The function will return the correct result for all valid inputs.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, categorizing the input months into two groups: months with 30 days and months with either 28, 29, or 31 days. There are no examples where the program does not work as expected, so we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case.
