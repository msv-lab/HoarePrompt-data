The original assessment claims that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I agree with this assessment. The program accurately identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and returns `True` for these months, while returning `False` for the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) and 28 or 29 days (February).

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, as it clearly states that the program returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November, and `False` otherwise. This is in line with the problem description, which asks to write a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not.

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly checks if the input month is in the list `thirty_days_months`, which contains the months with 30 days. The function handles all possible cases, as it returns `True` for the months with 30 days and `False` for the months with a different number of days.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
