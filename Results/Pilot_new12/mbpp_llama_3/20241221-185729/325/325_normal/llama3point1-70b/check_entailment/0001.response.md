Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The function then uses the `in` operator to check if the given month number is in the `thirty_days_months` list. If the month number is in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 30 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This program correctly handles all potential cases, as it accurately identifies the months with 30 days. The function will return `True` for the months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for all other months, which is in accordance with the problem description.

For example, if you call `func_1(4)`, the function will return `True` because April has 30 days. If you call `func_1(1)`, the function will return `False` because January has 31 days. This pattern holds for all 12 months, making the program correct.
