Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem statement requires a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1(month)` takes a month as input and checks if it is one of the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November).

The function uses a predefined list `thirty_days_months` that contains the numbers of the months with 30 days. It then checks if the input month is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

Since the months with 30 days are exactly April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), and these are the only months checked by the function, the function will correctly return `True` for these months and `False` for all other months. Therefore, the program accurately implements the problem description.
