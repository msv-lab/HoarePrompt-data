Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to make sense. The function `func_1(month)` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are stored in the `thirty_days_months` list.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior. It states that the program returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November; otherwise, it returns False. This aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

The original assessment also correctly notes that the function handles all inputs from 1 to 12 correctly, returning True for months with 30 days and False for months with 31 days or 28/29 days.

Given that the annotated version of the code supports the original assessment, and there are no contradictions or additional information that would suggest otherwise, the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
