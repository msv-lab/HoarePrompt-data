The original assessment is that the program is correct. After reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment.

The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1(month)` that checks if the input `month` is in the list of months with 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The output hints confirm that the function determines whether a given month has 30 days and returns True if it is one of the months with 30 days and False otherwise. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles all inputs from 1 to 12 correctly, including months with 30 days, months with 31 days, and months with 28 or 29 days. The function behaves as expected for all possible inputs, and there are no exceptions or edge cases beyond the basic month validation implied by the input range (1 <= month <= 12).

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
