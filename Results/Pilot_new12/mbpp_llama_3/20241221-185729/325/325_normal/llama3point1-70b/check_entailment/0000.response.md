Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(month)` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are stored in the `thirty_days_months` list.

The function simply checks if the input `month` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. This logic is sound and covers all possible cases, as the problem description only mentions months with 30 days.

The function handles all inputs from 1 to 12 correctly:

- For months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `True`.
- For months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the function returns `False`.
- For months with 28 or 29 days (2), the function returns `False`, which is correct because the problem description asks for months with exactly 30 days.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs, it is considered correct.
