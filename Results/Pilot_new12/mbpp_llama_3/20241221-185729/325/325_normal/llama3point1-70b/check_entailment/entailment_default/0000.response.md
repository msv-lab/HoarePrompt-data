Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given code correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November). The function `func_1` then checks if the input `month` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This approach covers all 12 months of the year, and the output hints agree with the code. The code does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., month numbers outside the range 1 to 12), but since we assume the input will be valid, this is not a concern. The function correctly categorizes the input month into two groups: months with 30 days and months with either 28, 29, or 31 days.

For example, if the input is `4` (April), the function will return `True`, because April has 30 days. If the input is `1` (January), the function will return `False`, because January has 31 days. This behavior aligns with the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases or exceptions that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code is correct.
