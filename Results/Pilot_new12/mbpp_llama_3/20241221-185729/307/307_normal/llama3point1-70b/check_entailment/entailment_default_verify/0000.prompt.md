You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. Here's why:

- The function starts with an index `idx` of 1 and enters a loop where it calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.
- If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.

The loop ensures that the function checks every triangular number in ascending order until it finds one with n digits. The use of `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` correctly determines whether a number has n digits or more, including the case when `n` is 1 (since a single-digit number also meets the condition for having at least 1 digit).

Given the logic and implementation, it seems that the function should work correctly for all positive integer values of `n`. It correctly handles the smallest cases (e.g., `n=1` returns `idx=1` because the first triangular number is 1, which has 1 digit) and will continue to increment `idx` until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits for larger values of `n`.

Without being able to find a specific case where the program does not work as expected based on the description, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers, starting from index 1, and returns the index as soon as it finds a triangular number whose string length meets the condition. The function does not have any conditional statements to limit the return value to 1, 2, or 3, as stated in the annotations; instead, it will return the smallest index that satisfies the condition, which can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or is less than 1, and it assumes that such input will not be provided. After the function executes, the program state will be the returned index `idx`, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number whose string length is greater than or equal to the input `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
