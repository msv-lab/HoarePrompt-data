You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest index for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, and the loop terminates with this value of `idx`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers, starting from index 1, and returns the index as soon as it finds a triangular number whose string length meets the condition. The function does not have any conditional statements to limit the return value to 1, 2, or 3, as stated in the annotations; instead, it will return the smallest index that satisfies the condition, which can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or is less than 1, and it assumes that such input will not be provided. After the function executes, the program state will be the returned index `idx`, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number whose string length is greater than or equal to the input `n`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
