Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The function starts with index 1 and keeps generating triangular numbers until it finds one whose string length is greater than or equal to the input n. The function then returns this index.

The code handles the general case where the input n can be any positive integer. The function does not have any conditional statements to limit the return value to specific integers, which means it can handle any positive integer input n.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of how the function works. The hints also mention that the function assumes the input will be a positive integer and does not handle cases where n is not a positive integer or is less than 1. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, so this does not affect the correctness of the code.

Overall, the code correctly implements the function as described in the problem, and there are no cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
