Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, where `n` is the number of digits.
- The function uses a while loop to generate triangular numbers. The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the `idx`-th triangular number.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the length of the string representation of the current triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`.
- The loop increments `idx` by 1 in each iteration, ensuring that it checks every possible triangular number until it finds one with `n` or more digits.
- The function returns the smallest index `idx` for which the corresponding triangular number has `n` or more digits.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It will always return the smallest index for which the triangular number has `n` or more digits, as required by the problem description. 

For example, if `n` is 3, the function will return the index of the smallest triangular number with 3 or more digits, which is 22 (the 22nd triangular number is 253). 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
