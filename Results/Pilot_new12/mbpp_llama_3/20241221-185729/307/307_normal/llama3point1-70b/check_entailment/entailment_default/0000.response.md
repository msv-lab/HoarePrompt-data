Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It iterates through triangular numbers, starting from index 1, and returns the index as soon as it finds a triangular number whose string length is greater than or equal to the input `n`. 

The code handles the case where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, which is the expected input. 

For example, when `n = 1`, the function will return `1` because the smallest triangular number with at least 1 digit is `1` itself, which has an index of `1`. 

When `n = 2`, the function will return `3` because the smallest triangular number with at least 2 digits is `6` (which is the 3rd triangular number), and `6` has 1 digit, but the next triangular number `10` (which is the 4th triangular number) has 2 digits. However, the function actually returns `4` for `n = 2` because `6` does not meet the condition of having at least 2 digits, but `10` does.

There are no examples that indicate the function will not work correctly for any valid input. The function does not need to handle invalid inputs such as negative numbers, zero, or non-integer inputs, as the problem description assumes that the input will be a positive integer. 

Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all expected inputs.
