Based on the provided problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, we can evaluate the program's correctness.

The problem description asks for a function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by describing the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, which aligns with the problem description's requirements. The loop continues until it finds the smallest index `idx` for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the logic and implementation of the function. The function starts with an index `idx` of 1, calculates the triangular number, checks if its string length is greater than or equal to `n`, and returns `idx` if the condition is met. If not, it increments `idx` and repeats the loop. This ensures that the function checks every triangular number in ascending order until it finds one with n digits.

The use of `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` correctly determines whether a number has n digits or more, including the case when `n` is 1. The loop's termination condition is also correct, as it returns the smallest index `idx` that meets the condition.

Given that the annotated version of the code confirms the original assessment's reasoning, and the function's logic and implementation align with the problem description, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
