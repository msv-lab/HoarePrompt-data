Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function uses a simple iterative approach to generate triangular numbers, starting from the first one (with index 1), and checks if the generated number has `n` or more digits.

Here's why the code works for every potential case:

1. **Iterative approach**: The function iterates over the indices of triangular numbers, starting from 1, which ensures that it checks every possible triangular number in ascending order.
2. **Correct triangular number generation**: The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is used to generate the `idx`-th triangular number, which is a well-known and correct formula.
3. **Digit count check**: The function checks if the generated triangular number has `n` or more digits by converting it to a string and checking its length using `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`. This approach correctly handles numbers with varying numbers of digits.
4. **Return the index of the smallest `n`-digit triangular number**: As soon as the function finds a triangular number with `n` or more digits, it returns the corresponding index, which is the smallest such index due to the iterative approach.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I could not find any scenario where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
