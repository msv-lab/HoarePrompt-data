Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits, and the provided function does exactly that.

The function `func_1` starts with an index `idx` of 1 and enters a loop where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. It then checks if the string length of this triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current `idx`.

The loop continues until it finds a triangular number whose string length meets the condition. Since the function iterates through the triangular numbers in ascending order of their indices, the first triangular number that meets the condition will be the smallest one with `n` digits.

The function does not restrict the return value to a specific range, which is correct because the problem description does not impose any such restrictions. The function will return the smallest index `idx` for which the triangular number has `n` digits, which can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

As the problem description and the program annotations assume that the input will be a valid positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 1, the function does not need to handle invalid input cases. Therefore, the program is correct, and it will always return the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for any valid input.
