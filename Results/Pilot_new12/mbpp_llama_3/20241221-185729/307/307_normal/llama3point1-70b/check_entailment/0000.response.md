Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. Here's why:

- The function starts with an index `idx` of 1 and enters a loop where it calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.
- If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.

The loop ensures that the function checks every triangular number in ascending order until it finds one with n digits. The use of `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` correctly determines whether a number has n digits or more, including the case when `n` is 1 (since a single-digit number also meets the condition for having at least 1 digit).

Given the logic and implementation, it seems that the function should work correctly for all positive integer values of `n`. It correctly handles the smallest cases (e.g., `n=1` returns `idx=1` because the first triangular number is 1, which has 1 digit) and will continue to increment `idx` until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits for larger values of `n`.

Without being able to find a specific case where the program does not work as expected based on the description, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
