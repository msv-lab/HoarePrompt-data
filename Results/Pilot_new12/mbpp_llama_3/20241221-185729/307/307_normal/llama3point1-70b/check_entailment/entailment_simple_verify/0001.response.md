The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and after analyzing the annotated version of the code and the problem description, I agree with this assessment. 

Here's why:

1. The iterative approach used in the function ensures that it checks every possible triangular number in ascending order, starting from the first one (with index 1). This is supported by the annotation stating that the state of the program right before the function call is that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

2. The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is used to generate the `idx`-th triangular number, which is a well-known and correct formula. This ensures that the program correctly generates triangular numbers.

3. The function checks if the generated triangular number has `n` or more digits by converting it to a string and checking its length using `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`. This approach correctly handles numbers with varying numbers of digits.

4. As soon as the function finds a triangular number with `n` or more digits, it returns the corresponding index, which is the smallest such index due to the iterative approach. The annotation after the loop confirms this, stating that `idx` is the smallest index for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`.

Since the original assessment provided a thorough and accurate analysis of the program's correctness, and the annotated version supports this analysis, I maintain the original assessment.

The reason I believe the program is correct is that it correctly implements the formula for generating triangular numbers, checks the length of these numbers, and returns the smallest index that meets the condition specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
