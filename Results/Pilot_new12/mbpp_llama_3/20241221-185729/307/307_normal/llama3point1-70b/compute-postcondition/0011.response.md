`idx` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition "If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns `idx`" is still valid and can potentially be triggered, but based on the provided initial state, `triangular_num` is 3, its string representation length is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Since the code `idx += 1` does not affect the condition related to the return of `idx` directly, the return condition remains dependent on the relationship between `n` and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num`. However, since `idx` has been incremented to 3, if the return condition is met, the returned value would be 3, not 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns `idx` which is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns `idx` which is 3.**
