To determine the final output state of the given loop, let's break down its behavior based on the provided information.

1. The loop runs indefinitely until it finds a triangular number whose string length is greater than or equal to `n`.
2. `idx` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. `triangular_num` is calculated as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which is the formula for the `idx`-th triangular number.
4. The loop checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `idx`.
5. From the given output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer that `idx` is incremented until the condition is met, at which point `idx` is returned, indicating the position of the triangular number that meets the length criteria.

Given this understanding, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be summarized as follows:

- The loop will terminate when it finds a triangular number whose string length is greater than or equal to `n`.
- At termination, `idx` will be the position of the triangular number that first meets the length condition.
- The `triangular_num` at the point of termination is not directly relevant to the output state in terms of `n` and `idx`, but it's implied that its string length is greater than or equal to `n`.
- Since `n` is a constant input (a positive integer greater than or equal to 1) and does not change during the loop, its value remains the same.

Therefore, considering the termination condition and the roles of `n` and `idx`, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`idx` is the smallest index for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, and the loop terminates with this value of `idx`.**
