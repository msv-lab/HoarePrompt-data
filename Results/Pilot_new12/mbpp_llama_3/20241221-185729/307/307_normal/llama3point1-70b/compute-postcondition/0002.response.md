The value of `triangular_num` is assigned as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 * 2 // 2` and further simplifies to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**
