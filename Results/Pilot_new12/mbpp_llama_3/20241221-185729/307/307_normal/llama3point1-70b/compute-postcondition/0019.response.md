Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` for which the string length of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers, starting from index 1, and returns the index as soon as it finds a triangular number whose string length meets the condition. The function does not have any conditional statements to limit the return value to 1, 2, or 3, as stated in the annotations; instead, it will return the smallest index that satisfies the condition, which can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or is less than 1, and it assumes that such input will not be provided. After the function executes, the program state will be the returned index `idx`, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number whose string length is greater than or equal to the input `n`.**
