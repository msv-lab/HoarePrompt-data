The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition of returning 3 if the number of digits in `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n` and returning None otherwise is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 4, `triangular_num` is 6. If the number of digits in `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns 3. Otherwise, the program returns None.
