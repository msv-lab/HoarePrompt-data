The code updates the value of `triangular_num` based on the current value of `idx`. Given that `idx` is 3, we can calculate the new value of `triangular_num` as follows: `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2 = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 3 * 4 // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
