According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. Since the condition is always true, no adjustments to the state are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1**
