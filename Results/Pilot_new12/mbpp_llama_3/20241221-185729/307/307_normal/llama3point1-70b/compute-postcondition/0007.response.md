According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it is manually stopped. Since there is no conditional statement that can cause the loop to terminate, the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
