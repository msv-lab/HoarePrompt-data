To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to examine the condition that would cause the loop to terminate or continue. However, since this is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement or an error. There are no conditional statements provided within the loop that would affect its continuation based on the variables `n`, `idx`, and `triangular_num`. 

Given this context, the loop will execute again regardless of the current state of `n`, `idx`, and `triangular_num`. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
