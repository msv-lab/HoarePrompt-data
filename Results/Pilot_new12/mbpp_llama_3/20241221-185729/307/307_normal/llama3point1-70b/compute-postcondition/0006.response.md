The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial state has `idx` as 1, so the new value of `idx` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
