The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer value based on certain conditions. Specifically, there are three possible return cases: 
Case_1: The function returns `idx` which is 1; 
Case_2: The function returns `idx` which is 2; 
Case_3: The function returns 3. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return an integer value, which can be 1, 2, or 3, based on the conditions defined within the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer parameter n and returns an integer value, which can be 1, 2, or 3, based on the conditions defined within the function.**
