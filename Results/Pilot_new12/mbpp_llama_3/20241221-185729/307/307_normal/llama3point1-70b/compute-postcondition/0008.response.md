To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the variables given in the initial state. The code provided is `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, where `idx` is 2.

Given `idx` is 2, we substitute this value into the formula to find `triangular_num`:
`triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`.

Thus, `triangular_num` is updated to 3.

The initial state also mentions that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`. With `triangular_num` now being 3, its string representation is '3', which has a length of 1. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the condition that the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is now 1) is less than `n` still holds true for all possible values of `n` given it is at least 1.

Therefore, after executing the given code:
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `idx` remains 2, as it was not modified by the code.
- `triangular_num` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3**
