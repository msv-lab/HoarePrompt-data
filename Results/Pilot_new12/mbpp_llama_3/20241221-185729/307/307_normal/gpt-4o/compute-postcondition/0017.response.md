To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information.

The loop calculates `triangular_number` using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` and checks if the length of its string representation is equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `k`. The loop increments `k` by 1 in each iteration.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop continues to execute as long as the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.
3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, the function returns `k`.

Since the loop is an infinite loop (`while True`), it will continue to execute until the condition for returning `k` is met.

After analyzing the loop's behavior, we can conclude that:

- The loop will continue to execute until it finds a `triangular_number` whose string representation has a length equal to `n`.
- Once the loop finds such a `triangular_number`, it will return the current value of `k`.
- If no such `triangular_number` is found, the loop will continue indefinitely, incrementing `k` by 1 in each iteration.

However, since the problem statement asks for the output state after all iterations have executed, and given that the loop will eventually return when it finds a matching `triangular_number`, we can infer the following output state:

- The loop will terminate when it finds a `triangular_number` whose string representation has a length equal to `n`.
- At the time of termination, `k` will be the smallest value for which the string representation of `triangular_number` has a length equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **The function returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to the original value of `n`, and this value of `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop has finished executing.**
