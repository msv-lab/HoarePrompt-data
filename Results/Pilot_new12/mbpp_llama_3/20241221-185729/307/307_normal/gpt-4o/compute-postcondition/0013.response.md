To find the output state, we first look at the initial state and the given code. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3. The code given is `triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Given that `k` is 3, we substitute `k` in the equation: `triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2`. This simplifies to `triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2`, which further simplifies to `triangular_number = 12 // 2`, resulting in `triangular_number = 6`.

The states of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Thus, `n` remains a positive integer, and `k` remains 3. The only change is in `triangular_number`, which is now 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
