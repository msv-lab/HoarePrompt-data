Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` (a triangular number) is equal to `n`. The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 1 until it finds a match, and returns this `k`. The function does not have any explicit error handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, so its behavior for such inputs is undefined. The return value is not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather can be any positive integer `k` that satisfies the condition for a given `n`. The function will continue to iterate indefinitely until it finds a `k` that meets the condition, implying that for very large or certain values of `n`, the function might not terminate in a reasonable time or might exceed maximum limit of `k` or `triangular_number` if it exists.**
