The initial state provides the following information: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1, and the string representation of `triangular_number` has a length equal to `n`. 

Given the code `return k`, we are returning the value of `k`. 

Output State: **The program returns k which is 1**
