According to the code, the `while` loop statement is `while True`, which means the loop will always execute again regardless of the current state. Since there are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to continue, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
