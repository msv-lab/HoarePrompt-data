The code updates the value of `triangular_number` to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `triangular_number` as `2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` is still a positive integer, and `k` is still 2. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is now the length of the string '3', which is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3**
