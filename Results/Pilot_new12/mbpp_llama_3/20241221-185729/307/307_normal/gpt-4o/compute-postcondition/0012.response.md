According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement or a return statement. 

Since the loop body is omitted, we can't determine if there's a break statement or not. However, we do know that if the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, the program returns 2, which would exit the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to adjust any states because it's a `while True` loop, which will always execute again unless it encounters a return statement or a break statement.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
