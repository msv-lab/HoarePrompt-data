The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is 2, so the new value of `k` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, if the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, the program returns 2, otherwise, there is no return value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, if the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, the program returns 2, otherwise, there is no return value**
