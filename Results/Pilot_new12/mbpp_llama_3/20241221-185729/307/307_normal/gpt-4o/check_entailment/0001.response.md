Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The function `func_1(n)` starts from `k=1` and calculates the kth triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. It then checks if the length of the string representation of this number is equal to `n`. If it is, it returns `k`. If not, it increments `k` and repeats the process.

The program handles all potential cases correctly because it:

*   Starts from `k=1`, which is the smallest possible triangular number (1).
*   Increments `k` by 1 in each iteration, ensuring that it checks every possible triangular number.
*   Uses the correct formula to calculate the kth triangular number.
*   Correctly checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, and `assert func_1(4) == 45` also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and I couldn't find any potential case where it would not work as expected.
