You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. The nth triangle number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side, and it is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

Here's why the provided function works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `k = 1`, which is the first triangular number (1). 

2. **Loop**: It enters a loop where it calculates the `kth` triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

3. **Condition Check**: It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`. If it does, the function returns `k`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

4. **Increment**: If the condition is not met, `k` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits.

This approach ensures that the function will always find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits because it checks every triangular number in ascending order.

The unit tests provided (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also confirm the correctness of the function for the cases where `n` equals 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits and the provided unit tests pass, it is reasonable to conclude that the function works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` (a triangular number) is equal to `n`. The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 1 until it finds a match, and returns this `k`. The function does not have any explicit error handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, so its behavior for such inputs is undefined. The return value is not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather can be any positive integer `k` that satisfies the condition for a given `n`. The function will continue to iterate indefinitely until it finds a `k` that meets the condition, implying that for very large or certain values of `n`, the function might not terminate in a reasonable time or might exceed maximum limit of `k` or `triangular_number` if it exists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
