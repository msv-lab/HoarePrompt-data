Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. The nth triangle number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side, and it is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

Here's why the provided function works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `k = 1`, which is the first triangular number (1). 

2. **Loop**: It enters a loop where it calculates the `kth` triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

3. **Condition Check**: It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`. If it does, the function returns `k`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

4. **Increment**: If the condition is not met, `k` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits.

This approach ensures that the function will always find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits because it checks every triangular number in ascending order.

The unit tests provided (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also confirm the correctness of the function for the cases where `n` equals 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits and the provided unit tests pass, it is reasonable to conclude that the function works as expected for all potential cases.
