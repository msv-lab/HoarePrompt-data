You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The function returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to the original value of `n`, and this value of `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop has finished executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` (a triangular number) is equal to `n`. The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 1 until it finds a match, and returns this `k`. The function does not have any explicit error handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, so its behavior for such inputs is undefined. The return value is not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather can be any positive integer `k` that satisfies the condition for a given `n`. The function will continue to iterate indefinitely until it finds a `k` that meets the condition, implying that for very large or certain values of `n`, the function might not terminate in a reasonable time or might exceed maximum limit of `k` or `triangular_number` if it exists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
