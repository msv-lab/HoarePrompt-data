Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct because it iterates through values of `k` starting from 1 until it finds a triangular number (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) that has `n` digits. The function returns the smallest `k` that satisfies this condition, which aligns with the problem description. The provided unit tests (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also pass, indicating that the function works as expected for these cases.

Additionally, the code does not have any apparent logical flaws or missing edge cases that would cause it to fail for valid inputs. Since we assume that the input will be valid (a positive integer `n`), the function's behavior for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs is not a concern.

Overall, based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, it appears that the function correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for all valid inputs.
