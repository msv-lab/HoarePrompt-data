Correctness: **True**.

The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` (a triangular number) is equal to `n`. The function iterates through values of `k` starting from 1 until it finds a match, and returns this `k`.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about its behavior, such as the lack of explicit error handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs. However, since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program, as they demonstrate that the function returns the expected values for different inputs.

The program will continue to iterate indefinitely until it finds a `k` that meets the condition, which is fine as long as such a `k` exists. The output hints mention that for very large or certain values of `n`, the function might not terminate in a reasonable time or might exceed maximum limit of `k` or `triangular_number` if it exists. However, this is not a correctness issue, but rather a potential performance issue.

Overall, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
