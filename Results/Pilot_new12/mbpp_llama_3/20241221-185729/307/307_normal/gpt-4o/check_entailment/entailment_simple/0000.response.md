Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

The program works by initializing a counter `k` to 1 and entering a loop where it calculates the `k`-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. It then checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number is equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `k`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

The program will continue to increment `k` and calculate triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` digits. This approach guarantees that the function will return the smallest `k` that corresponds to a triangular number with `n` digits, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different values of `n`. For example, `func_1(2)` returns 4, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number with 2 digits (10), and `func_1(3)` returns 14, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number with 3 digits (105), and so on. 

Therefore, the program is correct because it implements the required functionality and produces the expected results.
