The problem description asks for a function to calculate the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height.

However, the provided function appears to be calculating the volume of a cylinder, not a cone. Although the formulas look similar, they are not exactly the same. The formula implemented in the function (1/3 * π * radius^2 * height) is used to describe the volume of a cylinder, with "height" and "radius" typically referring to the height and radius of the cylinder, respectively.

Therefore, the given function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description because it calculates the volume of a cylinder, not a cone.

Correctness: **False**
