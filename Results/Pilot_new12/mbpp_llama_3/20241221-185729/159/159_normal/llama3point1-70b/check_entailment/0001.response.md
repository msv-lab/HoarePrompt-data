Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`, is the correct mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone.

This program correctly handles all potential cases, as it does not have any conditional statements or loops that could introduce errors. It simply applies the formula to the input values.

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 10)`, it will correctly return the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 and a height of 10. The program does not have any limitations or edge cases that are not handled, as it will work correctly for any positive values of radius and height.

It is worth noting that the program does not include any error checking to handle cases where the input values are not positive numbers. However, based on the provided problem description, it can be assumed that the input values will always be valid. If error checking were required, the program could be modified to include checks for negative numbers and non-numeric input. Nevertheless, given the problem description, the program is correct.
