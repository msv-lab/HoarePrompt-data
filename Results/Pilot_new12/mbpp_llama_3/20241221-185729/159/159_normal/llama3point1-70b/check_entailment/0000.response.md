Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a cone using the formula `V = (1/3) * π * r^2 * h`. The function `func_1(radius, height)` takes the radius and height of the cone as input and returns the volume. 

The formula used in the function is a direct implementation of the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone, with `math.pi` used to represent the constant π. 

The function does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It handles the calculation of the volume for any given radius and height, including non-integer values.

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 10)`, it will correctly calculate and return the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 and a height of 10. 

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
