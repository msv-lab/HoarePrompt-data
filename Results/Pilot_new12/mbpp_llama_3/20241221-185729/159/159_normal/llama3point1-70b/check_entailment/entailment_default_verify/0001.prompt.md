You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function, `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`, is the correct mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone.

This program correctly handles all potential cases, as it does not have any conditional statements or loops that could introduce errors. It simply applies the formula to the input values.

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 10)`, it will correctly return the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 and a height of 10. The program does not have any limitations or edge cases that are not handled, as it will work correctly for any positive values of radius and height.

It is worth noting that the program does not include any error checking to handle cases where the input values are not positive numbers. However, based on the provided problem description, it can be assumed that the input values will always be valid. If error checking were required, the program could be modified to include checks for negative numbers and non-numeric input. Nevertheless, given the problem description, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height as non-negative numbers. It accepts two parameters, radius and height, and returns a single value representing the volume, calculated as 1/3 * Ï€ * radius^2 * height. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for negative or non-numeric inputs, so it assumes the inputs are valid. The function's output is a single numeric value representing the volume of the cylinder. Note that the function does not modify the input parameters, radius and height, and does not have any side effects beyond returning the calculated volume.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
