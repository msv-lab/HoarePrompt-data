Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it calculates the volume of a cylinder, not a cone. The formula used in the program, `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`, is the formula for the volume of a cylinder, but the problem description asks for the volume of a cone. The correct formula for the volume of a cone is `(1.0 / 3) * math.pi * radius * radius * height`, but this formula should be used to calculate the volume of a cone, which has a different shape and characteristics than a cylinder.

The formula used in the program is actually correct for a cylinder, but since the problem description asks for the volume of a cone, the program does not meet the requirements. If the problem description asked for the volume of a cylinder, the program would be correct. However, since it asks for the volume of a cone, the program does not follow the problem description. 

The correct formula for the volume of a cone is the same as that for the volume of a cylinder in terms of the values used in the formula, but the volumes for the cone and the cylinder are calculated for two completely different shapes, and since the formula given in the problem description must be used to calculate the volume of a cone, then the given program must calculate the volume of a cone, not the volume of a cylinder. So, the given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description since it does not calculate the volume of a cone. 

A correct implementation of the problem description would use the same formula, but with comments and documentation that accurately describe the calculation being performed, which in this case is the volume of a cone, not a cylinder. 

Here is a correct implementation of the program in Python:
```python
import math

# State of the program right before the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    # The program returns the volume of a cone, calculated as 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height, 
    # where radius and height are non-negative numbers.
    return (1.0 / 3) * math.pi * radius * radius * height

# Overall this is what the function does: 
# The function calculates and returns the volume of a cone given the radius and height as non-negative numbers. 
# It accepts two parameters, radius and height, and returns a single value representing the volume, 
# calculated as 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height.
