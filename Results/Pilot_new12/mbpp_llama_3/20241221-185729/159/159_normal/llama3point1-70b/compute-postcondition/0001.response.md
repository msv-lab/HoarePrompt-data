The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of a cylinder. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume of a cylinder based on these input values.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, radius and height, which are non-negative numbers, and returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as 1/3 * Ï€ * radius^2 * height.**
