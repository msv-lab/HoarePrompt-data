Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height as non-negative numbers. It accepts two parameters, radius and height, and returns a single value representing the volume, calculated as 1/3 * Ï€ * radius^2 * height. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for negative or non-numeric inputs, so it assumes the inputs are valid. The function's output is a single numeric value representing the volume of the cylinder. Note that the function does not modify the input parameters, radius and height, and does not have any side effects beyond returning the calculated volume.**
