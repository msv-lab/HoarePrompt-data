#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a cone, given non-negative real numbers for radius and height, using the formula 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height. The input parameters, radius and height, are not modified by the function. If either radius or height is negative, or if they are non-numeric, the function will throw an exception or produce an incorrect result, as the calculation does not account for these cases. Additionally, if both radius and height are zero, the function returns zero, which is a valid result for the volume of a cone with zero dimensions. The function assumes that the input values are valid numbers and does not perform any explicit error checking or handling. The result, which is the calculated volume of the cone, is returned as a non-negative real number.
