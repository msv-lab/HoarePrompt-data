Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function is `1/3 * π * radius^2 * height`, which is the standard formula for the volume of a cone.

The program includes three assertions that test the function with different inputs and verify that the results match the expected values within a relative tolerance of 0.001. These assertions suggest that the function is working correctly for the tested cases.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Zero radius**: If the radius of the cone is zero, the function should return zero, since a cone with zero radius has zero volume. Plugging `radius = 0` into the formula, we get `1/3 * π * 0^2 * height = 0`, which is the expected result.

2. **Zero height**: If the height of the cone is zero, the function should return zero, since a cone with zero height has zero volume. Plugging `height = 0` into the formula, we get `1/3 * π * radius^2 * 0 = 0`, which is the expected result.

3. **Negative radius or height**: The function does not explicitly handle negative values for the radius or height. However, since the radius and height are squared in the formula, the function will still produce a result for negative inputs. Nevertheless, in the context of calculating the volume of a cone, negative values for the radius or height are not meaningful, and the function does not include any error checking to handle these cases.

Despite the lack of error checking for negative inputs, the program seems to correctly implement the formula for the volume of a cone for non-negative inputs. Since the problem description does not specify any requirements for handling negative inputs or other edge cases, and the provided assertions suggest that the function is working correctly for the tested cases, we can conclude that the program is correct within the scope of the problem description.
