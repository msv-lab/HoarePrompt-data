You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a cone based on the provided problem description. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The given function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements this formula.

The provided unit tests also verify that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the calculated volumes are within a small tolerance of the expected values, which is a good practice to account for floating-point precision errors.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, no potential cases could be found where the program does not work correctly. The function correctly calculates the volume of a cone for any given radius and height, and the unit tests provide additional confidence in the function's correctness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the volume of a cone, given non-negative real numbers for radius and height, using the formula 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height. The input parameters, radius and height, are not modified by the function. If either radius or height is negative, or if they are non-numeric, the function will throw an exception or produce an incorrect result, as the calculation does not account for these cases. Additionally, if both radius and height are zero, the function returns zero, which is a valid result for the volume of a cone with zero dimensions. The function assumes that the input values are valid numbers and does not perform any explicit error checking or handling. The result, which is the calculated volume of the cone, is returned as a non-negative real number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
