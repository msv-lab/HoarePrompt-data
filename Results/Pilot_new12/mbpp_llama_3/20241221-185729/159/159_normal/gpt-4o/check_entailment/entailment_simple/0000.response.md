Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a cone based on the formula 1/3 * Ï€ * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function `func_1` returns the expected results for different inputs, validating its correctness. The formula used in the function matches the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone, ensuring that it will produce the correct result for any valid input.

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., non-negative real numbers) means that the program does not need to include error checking or handling for invalid inputs, which is consistent with the problem description. 

Therefore, as long as the inputs are valid, the function will always return the correct volume of a cone, making it a correct implementation according to the problem description.
