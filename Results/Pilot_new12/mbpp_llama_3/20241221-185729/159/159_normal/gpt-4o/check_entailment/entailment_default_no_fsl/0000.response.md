Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used, `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is correct and matches the problem description. The function assumes that the input values are valid non-negative real numbers, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem description. The function does not perform explicit error checking or handling, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

The provided unit tests, using `math.isclose`, demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, and there are no cases mentioned in the output hints that would indicate incorrect behavior for valid input. The output hints also mention that the function will throw an exception or produce an incorrect result for invalid inputs (negative numbers, non-numeric values), but this is not a concern since we assume that the input will always be valid. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to correctly implement the function to find the volume of a cone for every potential valid case.
