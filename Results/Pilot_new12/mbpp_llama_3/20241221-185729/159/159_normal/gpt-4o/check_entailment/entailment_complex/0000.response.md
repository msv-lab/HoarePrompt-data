Correctness: **True**

The given Python program accurately calculates the volume of a cone, as described in the problem description. The formula used, `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, is the standard mathematical formula for the volume of a cone, where `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers.

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are assumed to be valid non-negative real numbers. It returns the calculated volume of the cone using the aforementioned formula. The program does not perform explicit error checking or handling, but since we assume that the input will always be valid (non-negative real numbers for `radius` and `height`), this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, and the comments in the code explain how the function calculates the volume of a cone, which aligns with the problem description.

In summary, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and accurately calculates the volume of a cone for any valid input. Therefore, it is considered correct.
