You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula used in the function is `1/3 * π * radius^2 * height`, which is the standard formula for the volume of a cone.

The program includes three assertions that test the function with different inputs and verify that the results match the expected values within a relative tolerance of 0.001. These assertions suggest that the function is working correctly for the tested cases.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Zero radius**: If the radius of the cone is zero, the function should return zero, since a cone with zero radius has zero volume. Plugging `radius = 0` into the formula, we get `1/3 * π * 0^2 * height = 0`, which is the expected result.

2. **Zero height**: If the height of the cone is zero, the function should return zero, since a cone with zero height has zero volume. Plugging `height = 0` into the formula, we get `1/3 * π * radius^2 * 0 = 0`, which is the expected result.

3. **Negative radius or height**: The function does not explicitly handle negative values for the radius or height. However, since the radius and height are squared in the formula, the function will still produce a result for negative inputs. Nevertheless, in the context of calculating the volume of a cone, negative values for the radius or height are not meaningful, and the function does not include any error checking to handle these cases.

Despite the lack of error checking for negative inputs, the program seems to correctly implement the formula for the volume of a cone for non-negative inputs. Since the problem description does not specify any requirements for handling negative inputs or other edge cases, and the provided assertions suggest that the function is working correctly for the tested cases, we can conclude that the program is correct within the scope of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the volume of a cone, given non-negative real numbers for radius and height, using the formula 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height. The input parameters, radius and height, are not modified by the function. If either radius or height is negative, or if they are non-numeric, the function will throw an exception or produce an incorrect result, as the calculation does not account for these cases. Additionally, if both radius and height are zero, the function returns zero, which is a valid result for the volume of a cone with zero dimensions. The function assumes that the input values are valid numbers and does not perform any explicit error checking or handling. The result, which is the calculated volume of the cone, is returned as a non-negative real number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
