Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a cone based on the provided problem description. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The given function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements this formula.

The provided unit tests also verify that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the calculated volumes are within a small tolerance of the expected values, which is a good practice to account for floating-point precision errors.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, no potential cases could be found where the program does not work correctly. The function correctly calculates the volume of a cone for any given radius and height, and the unit tests provide additional confidence in the function's correctness.
