To calculate the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state is that `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. The Python code calculates and returns the volume of a cone, given by the formula `1/3 * π * radius^2 * height`.

Given that:
- `radius` is a non-negative real number.
- `height` is a non-negative real number.
- `math.pi` is approximately 3.14159, a constant representing the mathematical constant pi.

The formula `1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height` calculates the volume of a cone with the given `radius` and `height`. 

Since both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, the calculated volume will also be a non-negative real number, because the product of non-negative numbers is non-negative, and `math.pi` is a positive constant.

Output State: **The program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * π * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.**
