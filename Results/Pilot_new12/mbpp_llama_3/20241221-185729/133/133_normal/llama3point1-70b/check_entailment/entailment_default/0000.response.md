Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` correctly implements the subtraction of elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to calculate the differences between corresponding elements.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. The hints also correctly note that if the tuples are not of the same length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, ignoring any remaining elements in the longer tuple.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to worry about cases where the input tuples are not of the same length or contain non-numeric elements.

Some examples to demonstrate the correctness of the code:
- `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` returns `(-3, -3, -3)`
- `func_1((10, 20), (1, 2))` returns `(9, 18)`
- `func_1((5, 5, 5), (1, 1, 1))` returns `(4, 4, 4)`

In all these cases, the code behaves as expected, returning the correct result for the subtraction operation between corresponding elements of the input tuples.
