You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a Python function named `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:
- The function uses the built-in `zip` function, which pairs the elements from the two input tuples based on their index. This ensures that the subtraction operation is applied to elements at the same index in both tuples.
- The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to calculate the differences between paired elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This efficiently creates a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements in `tup2` from those in `tup1`.
- The function handles tuples of any length, as long as both input tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are of unequal length, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to incorrect results if the caller expects the function to handle tuples of different lengths differently. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in the case of tuples of different lengths, implying that the input tuples are expected to be of the same length.

Since the code performs the described operation correctly for tuples of the same length and does not explicitly handle edge cases such as tuples of different lengths or non-numeric elements, it meets the requirements as specified. Without additional requirements or edge cases to consider, the code can be considered correct as per the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length with elements that support subtraction, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length and that all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other, implying that the elements are numeric or support subtraction operations. If the tuples are not of the same length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, ignoring any remaining elements in the longer tuple. If the elements are not subtractable, the function will raise a TypeError. After execution, the original input tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, remain unchanged, and a new tuple is returned containing the subtraction results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
