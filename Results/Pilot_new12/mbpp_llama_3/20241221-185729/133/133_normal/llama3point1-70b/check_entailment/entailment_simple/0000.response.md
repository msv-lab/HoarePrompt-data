Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. This is achieved by using the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to calculate the differences.

The program assumes that the input tuples are of the same length and contain elements that support subtraction (e.g., numbers), which is in line with the problem description.

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the function will return `(-3, -3, -3)`, which are the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`.

The use of the `tuple` function to convert the generator expression to a tuple ensures that the output is a tuple, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
