Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. It takes two tuples, subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. 

The code uses the built-in `zip` function, which stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, ignoring any remaining elements in the longer tuple. This behavior is consistent with the output hints provided.

Additionally, the code raises a TypeError if the elements are not subtractable, which is also consistent with the output hints. The original input tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, remain unchanged, and a new tuple is returned containing the subtraction results.

Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct for every potential case. The use of a generator expression inside the `tuple` function ensures that the subtraction results are calculated on the fly and stored in a tuple, which is then returned by the function.
