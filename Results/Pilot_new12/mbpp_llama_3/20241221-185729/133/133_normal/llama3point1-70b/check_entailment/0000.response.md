Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a Python function named `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:
- The function uses the built-in `zip` function, which pairs the elements from the two input tuples based on their index. This ensures that the subtraction operation is applied to elements at the same index in both tuples.
- The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to calculate the differences between paired elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This efficiently creates a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements in `tup2` from those in `tup1`.
- The function handles tuples of any length, as long as both input tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are of unequal length, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to incorrect results if the caller expects the function to handle tuples of different lengths differently. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in the case of tuples of different lengths, implying that the input tuples are expected to be of the same length.

Since the code performs the described operation correctly for tuples of the same length and does not explicitly handle edge cases such as tuples of different lengths or non-numeric elements, it meets the requirements as specified. Without additional requirements or edge cases to consider, the code can be considered correct as per the provided problem description.
