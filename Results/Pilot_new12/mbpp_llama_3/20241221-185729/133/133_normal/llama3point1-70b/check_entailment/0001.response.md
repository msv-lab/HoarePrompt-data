Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input. The function uses the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from the two tuples and then uses a generator expression to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple. The result is returned as a tuple.

This program correctly implements the problem description, as it subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The use of `zip` ensures that the elements are paired correctly, and the generator expression performs the subtraction operation as required.

The program handles tuples of equal length correctly, which is implied by the problem description. If the tuples are of unequal length, `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which is the expected behavior in this case, as the problem description does not specify what to do with tuples of unequal length.

To test the program, you can use the following examples:
```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)))  # Output: (-3, -3, -3)
print(func_1((7, 8, 9), (1, 1, 1)))  # Output: (6, 7, 8)
print(func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))  # Output: (-2, -2)
```
