Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Same Length Tuples**: Although the problem description assumes that both input tuples are of the same length, the program handles the case where tuples might not be of the same length. The `zip` function in Python stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, ignoring any remaining elements in the longer tuple. This is in line with the overall behavior described in the annotated program, making the program's behavior consistent with its description.

2. **Elements Support Subtraction**: The problem description and the program assume that all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other, implying they are numeric or support subtraction operations. Given this assumption, the program correctly performs the subtraction between corresponding elements.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`, as specified in the problem description.

4. **Original Tuples Remain Unchanged**: The program does not modify the original input tuples; instead, it returns a new tuple with the subtraction results, which aligns with the problem description.

5. **Handling of Invalid Inputs**: While the problem description does not explicitly require handling cases where inputs might not meet the assumptions (e.g., tuples of different lengths, non-numeric elements), the program's behavior under these conditions is well-defined and consistent with Python's built-in behaviors (e.g., `zip` stopping at the end of the shorter tuple, raising a TypeError for non-subtractable elements).

Therefore, under the assumption that the inputs will always be valid (tuples of the same length containing elements that support subtraction), the program does exactly what the problem description asks for in every potential case.
