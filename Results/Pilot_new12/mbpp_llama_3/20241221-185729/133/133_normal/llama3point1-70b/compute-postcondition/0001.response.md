The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing elements that support subtraction. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, of the same length with subtractable elements and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2.**
