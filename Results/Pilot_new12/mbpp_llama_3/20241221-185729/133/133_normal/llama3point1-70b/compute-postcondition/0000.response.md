The code calculates the difference between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2` using a generator expression within the `tuple` function. It utilizes the `zip` function to iterate over `tup1` and `tup2` in parallel. 

Given that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length and contain elements that support subtraction (such as numbers), the result will be a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2**
