#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing elements that support subtraction (e.g., numbers).
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length with elements that support subtraction, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length and that all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other, implying that the elements are numeric or support subtraction operations. If the tuples are not of the same length, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, ignoring any remaining elements in the longer tuple. If the elements are not subtractable, the function will raise a TypeError. After execution, the original input tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, remain unchanged, and a new tuple is returned containing the subtraction results.
