The program iterates over two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length using the `zip` function. For each pair of corresponding elements `a` and `b` from `tup1` and `tup2`, respectively, it calculates the difference `a - b`. The results of these subtractions are collected into a new tuple, which is then returned by the program.

Given that `tup1` and `tup2` contain elements that support subtraction, the returned tuple will contain the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.**
