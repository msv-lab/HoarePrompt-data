Correctness: **True**

This program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `zip` function in Python, which aggregates elements from each of the iterables (in this case, the two tuples) and returns an iterator of tuples, where the first item in each passed iterator is paired together, and then the second item in each passed iterator are paired together and so on.

It then uses a generator expression to iterate over these pairs of elements and subtracts the elements of the second tuple (`b`) from the elements of the first tuple (`a`). The results are then wrapped in a tuple using the `tuple` function, which is returned by the function.

For example, if you call `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))`, it will first pair up the elements with the same index from each tuple: `(10, 2)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 18)`. It will then subtract the second element from the first in each pair, resulting in `8`, `-1`, `-13`, which are returned as a tuple.

This matches the problem description exactly, as it subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple at the same index, and returns the results as a tuple. Since this holds true for every potential case due to the iterative nature of the `zip` function and the generator expression, the function is correct.
