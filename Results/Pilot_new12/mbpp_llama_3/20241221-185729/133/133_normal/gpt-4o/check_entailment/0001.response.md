Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two tuples and returns a new tuple containing the results of subtracting the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the input tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to calculate the differences between corresponding elements. The results are then wrapped in a `tuple` call to convert the generator expression into a tuple.

This implementation correctly handles tuples of any length, as long as they are the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, and the remaining elements of the longer tuple will be ignored.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior with tuples of the same length, and the results match the expected behavior.

One potential edge case is when the input tuples are of different lengths. In this case, the function will return a tuple containing the results of subtracting corresponding elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. For example:

```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5)))  # Output: (-3, -3)
```

This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify what to do when the input tuples are of different lengths. 

However, if the problem description intended to require the input tuples to be of the same length, and to raise an error when they are not, then the function would be incorrect. But based on the provided information, the function appears to be correct. 

In general, the function works correctly for all potential cases, assuming that the input tuples can be of any length, and that the function should stop at the end of the shorter tuple when they are of different lengths.
