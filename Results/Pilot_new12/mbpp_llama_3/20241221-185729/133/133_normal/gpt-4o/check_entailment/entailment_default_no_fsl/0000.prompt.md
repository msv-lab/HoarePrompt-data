You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length as input, where elements support subtraction. It calculates and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function does not modify the original input tuples and assumes that all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other, potentially raising an error if this assumption is violated. The function does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths or contain non-subtractable elements explicitly, implying that such inputs could result in errors or unexpected behavior. Upon successful execution, the program state includes the original input tuples remaining unchanged and a new tuple being returned, which contains the element-wise differences.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
