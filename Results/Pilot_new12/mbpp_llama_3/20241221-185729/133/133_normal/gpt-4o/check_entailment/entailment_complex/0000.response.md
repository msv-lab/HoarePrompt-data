Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description because it correctly subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple with the same index. 

Here is why it does so:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are assumed to be of the same length.
2. The function uses a generator expression with `zip` to iterate over the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`.
3. For each pair of corresponding elements `a` and `b`, it calculates the difference `a - b`.
4. The results are collected into a new tuple using the `tuple` function.
5. The function returns this new tuple, which contains the element-wise differences between `tup1` and `tup2`.

The program does not modify the original input tuples, and it assumes that all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other. However, as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various input scenarios, and the annotations in the code clearly explain the expected behavior.

Therefore, the program is correct because it always performs the element-wise subtraction of the second tuple from the first tuple, as specified in the problem description.
