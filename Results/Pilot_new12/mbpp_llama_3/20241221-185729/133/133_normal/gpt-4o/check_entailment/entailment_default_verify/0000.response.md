The original assessment concludes that the provided function `func_1` is correct. Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with this assessment.

The problem description asks for a function that subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The provided function `func_1` does exactly this using the `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel and a generator expression to perform the subtraction.

The output hints summarize the code functionality accurately, stating that the function takes two tuples of the same length as input, calculates the differences between corresponding elements, and returns a new tuple without modifying the original input tuples. The hints also note that the function assumes all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other and does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths or contain non-subtractable elements explicitly.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's behavior of stopping at the end of the shorter tuple when the tuples have different lengths is consistent with the `zip` function and does not violate the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
