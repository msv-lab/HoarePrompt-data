Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to perform the subtraction. The result is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple` function.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function for different inputs. The function handles tuples of the same length, and the subtraction operation is performed element-wise.

To verify the correctness of the function, I considered the following cases:

* Tuples of the same length with positive and negative numbers.
* Tuples with zero elements.
* Tuples with the same elements.

In all these cases, the function produces the expected output. Since I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected, I conclude that the function is correct.

Here's an example of how the function works:
```python
print(func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)))  # Output: (8, -1, -13)
print(func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)))  # Output: (-13, -43, -13)
print(func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)))  # Output: (-3, 7, -3)
```
However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the tuples have different lengths. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, without producing an error. This behavior is consistent with the `zip` function, which stops at the end of the shortest input iterable. 

For example:
```python
print(func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5)))  # Output: (8, -1)
```
