Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code is a Python function `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The code uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel and a generator expression to calculate the differences.

The function's behavior matches the problem description, which requires subtracting the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input tuples.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function assumes the input tuples are of the same length and contain elements that support subtraction. While the function may raise an error for invalid inputs (e.g., tuples of different lengths or containing non-subtractable elements), the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid.

Given that the code correctly implements the described behavior for valid inputs, and considering the provided unit tests and output hints, it appears that the code is correct for every potential case within the assumed constraints.
