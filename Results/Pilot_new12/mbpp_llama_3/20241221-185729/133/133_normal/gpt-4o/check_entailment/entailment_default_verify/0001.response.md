The original assessment is that the correctness of the program is **True**. Based on the problem description and the provided code, this assessment seems to be accurate. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as input, calculates the differences between corresponding elements using a generator expression with `zip`, and returns the result as a new tuple. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correct behavior for tuples of the same length, which is in line with the problem description.

The output hints provided confirm that the function is intended to operate on tuples of the same length, with elements that support subtraction, and that it does not explicitly handle cases of different lengths or non-subtractable elements. This matches the behavior observed in the code and the original assessment.

One might consider the lack of explicit error handling for tuples of different lengths or non-subtractable elements as a potential issue. However, given that the problem description does not specify what to do in these cases and assuming, as stated, that the input will always be valid (i.e., tuples of the same length with subtractable elements), the program behaves as expected within these constraints.

Therefore, considering the provided information, the original assessment that the program's correctness is **True** seems accurate. The program does what the problem description asks for under the assumption of valid input, and the output hints confirm the expected behavior under these conditions.

Final: **True**
