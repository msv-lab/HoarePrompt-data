Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid inputs are provided. It takes two tuples as input, subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple, and returns a new tuple containing these differences. 

The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to calculate the differences between corresponding elements. The `tuple` function is then used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is returned by the function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including tuples with positive and negative differences. The function also does not modify the original input tuples, as required by the problem description.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., two tuples of the same length with subtractable elements), the function will work correctly for all such inputs. It will raise an error if the tuples are of different lengths or contain non-subtractable elements, but this is outside the scope of the problem description.
