#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing elements that support subtraction.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length as input, where elements support subtraction. It calculates and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. The function does not modify the original input tuples and assumes that all elements within the tuples can be subtracted from each other, potentially raising an error if this assumption is violated. The function does not handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths or contain non-subtractable elements explicitly, implying that such inputs could result in errors or unexpected behavior. Upon successful execution, the program state includes the original input tuples remaining unchanged and a new tuple being returned, which contains the element-wise differences.
