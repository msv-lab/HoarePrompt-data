Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements from `lst` and `tpl`. The code uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list with the tuple converted to a list using `list(tpl)`. This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including empty lists and tuples. 

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements from `lst` and `tpl`, and that the original list `lst` and tuple `tpl` remain unchanged. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected, correctly concatenating the tuple elements to the end of the list. Since the function correctly implements the required behavior and handles all potential cases, the correctness is **True**. 

Note that the assumption of valid input is also respected, as the function is designed to work with lists and tuples, and the problem description does not specify any error handling requirements for invalid inputs.
