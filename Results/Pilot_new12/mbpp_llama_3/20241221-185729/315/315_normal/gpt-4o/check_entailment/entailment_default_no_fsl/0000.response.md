Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input parameters. It accurately adds all elements from the tuple to the list by converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating it with the original list using the `+` operator. This operation does not modify the original list or tuple; instead, it returns a new list containing all elements from both input data structures.

The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists and tuples, correctly. For example, if `lst` is an empty list `[]` and `tpl` is a tuple `(1, 2)`, the function will return `[1, 2]`, which is the expected behavior. Similarly, if `lst` is a non-empty list `[1, 2]` and `tpl` is an empty tuple `()`, the function will return `[1, 2]`, again as expected.

Given the assumptions that the input will always be valid (i.e., `lst` will always be a list and `tpl` will always be a tuple), the function behaves as intended according to the problem description for every potential case. There are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, based on the provided code and the output hints.
