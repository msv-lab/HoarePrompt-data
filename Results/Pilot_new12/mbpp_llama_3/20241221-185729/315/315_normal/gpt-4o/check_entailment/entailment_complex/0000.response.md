Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input parameters and returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements from `lst` and `tpl`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input handling**: The program assumes that the input will be a list and a tuple, which is in line with the problem description.
2. **Concatenation**: The program uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl`, which is converted to a list using the `list()` function. This produces a new list that contains all elements from both `lst` and `tpl`.
3. **Original inputs remain unchanged**: The program does not modify the original list `lst` or tuple `tpl`, which is in line with the problem description.
4. **Edge cases**: Although the problem description mentions that the function handles all possible edge cases, including empty lists and tuples, the program's implementation does not explicitly handle these cases. However, since the `+` operator and `list()` function work correctly with empty lists and tuples, the program will still produce the correct output even in these cases.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, it is correct.
