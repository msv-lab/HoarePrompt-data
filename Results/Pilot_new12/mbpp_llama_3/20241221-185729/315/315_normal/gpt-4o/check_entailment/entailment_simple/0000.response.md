Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to add the given tuple to the given list. The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple.

This is achieved by the line `return lst + list(tpl)`, where `list(tpl)` converts the tuple to a list and `lst +` concatenates this new list to the original list.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple (after converting the tuple to a list). This operator is defined for lists in Python and always produces a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the list to be concatenated.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. For example, `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, which is the expected result.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is verified.
