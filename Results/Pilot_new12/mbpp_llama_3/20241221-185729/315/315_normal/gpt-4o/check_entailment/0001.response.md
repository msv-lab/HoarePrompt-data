Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the original list and the tuple. The program uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple after converting the tuple to a list using the `list()` function.

This program works correctly for every potential case because it handles the following:

- It correctly concatenates the list and the tuple.
- It handles tuples of any length, not just tuples with two elements as shown in the provided unit tests.
- It does not modify the original list, which is a desirable behavior in functional programming.
- It works with empty lists and tuples.
- It handles tuples containing any type of elements, not just integers.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness with different input scenarios:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5)))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(func_1([], (1, 2)))  # Expected output: [1, 2]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3], ()))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
print(func_1([], ()))  # Expected output: []
print(func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], ('a', 'b')))  # Expected output: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 'a', 'b']
```
All these test cases pass, which further confirms that the program works as expected for various input scenarios.
