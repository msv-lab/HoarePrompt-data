Correctness: **True**.

The program provided appears to be correct as it successfully adds the given tuple to the given list. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function, and then concatenates this list with the original list using the `+` operator. This results in a new list that contains all the elements from the original list followed by all the elements from the tuple.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program, as they demonstrate the expected behavior for different inputs. The function correctly appends the tuple elements to the list without modifying the original list.

For example, when calling `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, the function returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, which is the expected result.

In general, the function will work correctly for any input list and tuple, regardless of their lengths or contents, as long as they are valid Python lists and tuples. Therefore, the program is considered correct based on the provided problem description.
