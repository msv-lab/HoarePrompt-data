You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
assert func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]
assert func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the original list and the tuple. The program uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple after converting the tuple to a list using the `list()` function.

This program works correctly for every potential case because it handles the following:

- It correctly concatenates the list and the tuple.
- It handles tuples of any length, not just tuples with two elements as shown in the provided unit tests.
- It does not modify the original list, which is a desirable behavior in functional programming.
- It works with empty lists and tuples.
- It handles tuples containing any type of elements, not just integers.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness with different input scenarios:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5)))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(func_1([], (1, 2)))  # Expected output: [1, 2]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3], ()))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3]
print(func_1([], ()))  # Expected output: []
print(func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], ('a', 'b')))  # Expected output: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 'a', 'b']
```
All these test cases pass, which further confirms that the program works as expected for various input scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input parameters, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements from `lst` and `tpl`. The original list `lst` and tuple `tpl` remain unchanged. The function handles all possible edge cases, including empty lists and tuples, and correctly returns a list containing all elements from both input data structures. The final state of the program is that a new concatenated list is returned, while the original input list and tuple are preserved in their original state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
