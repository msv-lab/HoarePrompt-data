The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input parameters, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements from `lst` and `tpl`. The original list `lst` and tuple `tpl` remain unchanged. The function handles all possible edge cases, including empty lists and tuples, and correctly returns a list containing all elements from both input data structures. The final state of the program is that a new concatenated list is returned, while the original input list and tuple are preserved in their original state.
