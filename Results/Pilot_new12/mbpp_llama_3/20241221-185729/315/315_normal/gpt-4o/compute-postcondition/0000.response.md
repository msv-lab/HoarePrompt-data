The code is trying to concatenate the list `lst` and the tuple `tpl` after converting `tpl` to a list. 
Since `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple, we can directly concatenate them after converting `tpl` to a list.
Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of list 'lst' and the elements of tuple 'tpl'**
