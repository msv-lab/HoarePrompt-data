The function accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as parameters and returns a new list that concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple. The original list and tuple remain unchanged. This concatenation will work regardless of the contents of the list and tuple, including empty lists or tuples, and lists or tuples containing any type of elements, such as strings, integers, floats, or other lists and tuples. If the input list or tuple contains mutable objects, the returned list will contain references to these mutable objects, meaning changes to these objects will be reflected in the returned list. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it will return a concatenation as long as the inputs are a list and a tuple, regardless of their contents.
