Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes an input list and an input tuple, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates this list with the input list using the `+` operator. The result is a new list that includes all elements from the original list and the tuple.

This approach correctly fulfills the problem description for every potential case where the inputs are a list and a tuple, regardless of their contents. The output hints agree with the code's functionality, indicating that the original list and tuple remain unchanged, and the function can handle various types of elements, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists or tuples.

The function also handles cases with empty lists or tuples correctly, as it simply returns the non-empty input, if any, or an empty list if both inputs are empty. Additionally, it correctly handles mutable objects within the inputs, where changes to these objects would be reflected in the returned list due to the nature of how lists and tuples store references to their elements.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (a list and a tuple), and the provided code does not need to handle error checking for invalid inputs, the code is correct under these assumptions for all potential valid cases.
