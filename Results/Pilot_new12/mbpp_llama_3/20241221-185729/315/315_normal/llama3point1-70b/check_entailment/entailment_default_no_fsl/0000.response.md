Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a Python function named `func_1` that takes an input list and an input tuple, converts the tuple into a list using the `list()` function, and then concatenates this new list with the original input list using the `+` operator. The result is a new list that contains all elements from the original list followed by all elements from the input tuple. 

This operation works for every potential case because it correctly handles any type of elements within the list and tuple, including but not limited to strings, integers, floats, and other lists or tuples. It also correctly handles empty lists and tuples by simply concatenating them (resulting in either the original list or tuple if the other is empty). Additionally, it preserves the original list and tuple, returning a new list that includes references to any mutable objects from the original inputs. This means changes to mutable objects within the returned list can affect the original list or tuple, but changes to the structure of the list itself (e.g., appending or inserting elements) will not affect the originals.

The function does not include any explicit error checking for the inputs being a list and a tuple, respectively, but under the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided (as per the problem description), this omission does not affect the correctness of the function for its intended purpose. Therefore, considering the described behavior aligns with the requirements for adding a tuple to a list and the assumption of valid inputs, the provided Python function correctly implements the described functionality.
