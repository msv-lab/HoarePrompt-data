You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a list that is a concatenation of `input_list` (the original list) and the elements of `input_tuple` (the original tuple converted to a list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as parameters and returns a new list that concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple. The original list and tuple remain unchanged. This concatenation will work regardless of the contents of the list and tuple, including empty lists or tuples, and lists or tuples containing any type of elements, such as strings, integers, floats, or other lists and tuples. If the input list or tuple contains mutable objects, the returned list will contain references to these mutable objects, meaning changes to these objects will be reflected in the returned list. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it will return a concatenation as long as the inputs are a list and a tuple, regardless of their contents.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
