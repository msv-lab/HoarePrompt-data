Correctness: **False**.

The given program is supposed to add a tuple to a list, but it does not actually add the tuple to the list. Instead, it converts the tuple to a list, then combines it with the original list using the `+` operator. This results in a new list where the elements of the tuple have been appended to the original list, rather than the tuple itself.

For example, if the input is `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5))`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is not the same as adding the tuple `(4, 5)` to the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The expected output would be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]`.

To correctly add the tuple to the list, the function should simply append the tuple to the list using the `append` method, like so:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
This way, the tuple itself is added to the list, rather than its elements being appended individually.
