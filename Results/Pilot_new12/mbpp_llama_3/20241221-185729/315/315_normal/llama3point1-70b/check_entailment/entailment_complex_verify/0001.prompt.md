You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not actually add the given tuple to the given list. Instead, it converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list. However, the problem statement specifically asks to add the tuple to the list, not to concatenate the converted tuple with the list. This can be a problem because it changes the original data type and structure of the tuple. 

In Python, tuples are immutable and cannot be changed once created, whereas lists are mutable. If we were to modify the original code to actually add the tuple to the list, it would involve using the `append()` method in Python, which would add the tuple as a single element to the list, rather than unpacking the tuple into individual elements.

Here's an example of when the program does not work correctly:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5)
result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

However, if the intention was to add the tuple as a single element to the list, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]`. To achieve this, the correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a list that is a concatenation of `input_list` (the original list) and the elements of `input_tuple` (the original tuple converted to a list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as parameters and returns a new list that concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple. The original list and tuple remain unchanged. This concatenation will work regardless of the contents of the list and tuple, including empty lists or tuples, and lists or tuples containing any type of elements, such as strings, integers, floats, or other lists and tuples. If the input list or tuple contains mutable objects, the returned list will contain references to these mutable objects, meaning changes to these objects will be reflected in the returned list. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it will return a concatenation as long as the inputs are a list and a tuple, regardless of their contents.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
