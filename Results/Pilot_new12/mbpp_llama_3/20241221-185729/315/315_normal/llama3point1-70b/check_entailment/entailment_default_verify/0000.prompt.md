You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program is supposed to add a tuple to a list, but it does not actually add the tuple to the list. Instead, it converts the tuple to a list, then combines it with the original list using the `+` operator. This results in a new list where the elements of the tuple have been appended to the original list, rather than the tuple itself.

For example, if the input is `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5))`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is not the same as adding the tuple `(4, 5)` to the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The expected output would be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]`.

To correctly add the tuple to the list, the function should simply append the tuple to the list using the `append` method, like so:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
This way, the tuple itself is added to the list, rather than its elements being appended individually.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as parameters and returns a new list that concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple. The original list and tuple remain unchanged. This concatenation will work regardless of the contents of the list and tuple, including empty lists or tuples, and lists or tuples containing any type of elements, such as strings, integers, floats, or other lists and tuples. If the input list or tuple contains mutable objects, the returned list will contain references to these mutable objects, meaning changes to these objects will be reflected in the returned list. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it will return a concatenation as long as the inputs are a list and a tuple, regardless of their contents.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
