Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as parameters and returns a new list that concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Concatenation**: The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate `input_list` (after converting `input_tuple` to a list) with the elements of `input_tuple`. This produces a new list that includes all elements from both the original list and the tuple, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

2. **Original List and Tuple Remain Unchanged**: Since the function returns a new list and does not modify the original `input_list` or `input_tuple`, the original list and tuple remain unchanged, as required.

3. **Handles Any Type of Elements**: The function does not check the types of elements within `input_list` or `input_tuple`, which means it can handle lists or tuples containing any type of elements, such as strings, integers, floats, or other lists and tuples, without any issues.

4. **Mutable Objects**: If `input_list` or `input_tuple` contains mutable objects, the returned list will contain references to these mutable objects. This means changes to these objects will be reflected in the returned list, which aligns with how Python handles mutable objects.

5. **No Error Checking Required**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., `input_list` will be a list and `input_tuple` will be a tuple), the function does not need to include any error checking code to handle invalid inputs.

In summary, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, concatenating a given list and tuple into a new list while leaving the originals unchanged, handling any types of elements, and dealing appropriately with mutable objects, all under the assumption of valid input.
