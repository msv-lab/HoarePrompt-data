Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not actually add the given tuple to the given list. Instead, it converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list. However, the problem statement specifically asks to add the tuple to the list, not to concatenate the converted tuple with the list. This can be a problem because it changes the original data type and structure of the tuple. 

In Python, tuples are immutable and cannot be changed once created, whereas lists are mutable. If we were to modify the original code to actually add the tuple to the list, it would involve using the `append()` method in Python, which would add the tuple as a single element to the list, rather than unpacking the tuple into individual elements.

Here's an example of when the program does not work correctly:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5)
result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

However, if the intention was to add the tuple as a single element to the list, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]`. To achieve this, the correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
