Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to add the given tuple to the given list, but the provided function returns a new list that is a concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple, rather than modifying the original list to include the tuple as its last element.

A correct implementation would be to use the `append` or `extend` method of the list to add the tuple to the end of the list. The `append` method would add the tuple as a single element at the end of the list, while the `extend` method would add each element of the tuple as a separate element at the end of the list.

Here is an example of a correct implementation using `append`:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Alternatively, if the intention is to add each element of the tuple as a separate element at the end of the list, the correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
