Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks to write a function to add the given tuple to the given list. However, the provided code converts the tuple to a list and then combines it with the original list using the `+` operator, resulting in a new list where the elements of the tuple have been appended to the original list, rather than the tuple itself.

The output hints support this assessment by stating that the function returns a new list that concatenates the original list with the elements of the tuple. This indicates that the function is not actually adding the tuple to the list as a single element, but rather appending its elements individually.

The correct implementation, as mentioned in the original assessment, would be to use the `append` method to add the tuple to the list, like so:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
This way, the tuple itself is added to the list, rather than its elements being appended individually. The output hints do not provide any evidence to contradict the original assessment, but rather reinforce it by describing the incorrect behavior of the provided code.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
