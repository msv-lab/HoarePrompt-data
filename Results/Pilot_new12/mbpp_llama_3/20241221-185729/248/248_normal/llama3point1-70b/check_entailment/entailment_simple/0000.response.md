To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to assess whether it accurately converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem description.

The provided function `func_1(input_list)` utilizes Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list into a tuple. This function is straightforward and directly addresses the requirement of converting a list to a tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description and the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list) simplify the task. The function does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs (like non-list inputs or empty lists) because such cases are excluded by the problem's constraints.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The core of the function, `return tuple(input_list)`, directly accomplishes the task of converting a list to a tuple. Python's `tuple()` function takes an iterable (like a list) and returns a tuple containing all the elements from the iterable in the same order. This is precisely what the problem description asks for.

3. **Output**: The function returns a tuple, which matches the expected output type specified in the problem description.

4. **Overall Functionality**: Given a valid list input, the function will reliably produce a tuple that contains all elements of the input list, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements.

Since the function `func_1(input_list)` accurately converts any given list into a tuple, following the exact specifications outlined in the problem description, and assuming all potential inputs are valid lists, the conclusion is that the program meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
