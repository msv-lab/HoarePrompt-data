Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple for every potential case. The `tuple()` function in Python is designed to convert an iterable, such as a list, into a tuple. This function works as expected for all types of lists, including empty lists, lists containing different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats), and lists containing nested lists or other iterables.

The code does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles the following scenarios:

- Empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`, which is the expected output.
- List with single element: `func_1([1])` returns `(1,)`, which is the expected output.
- List with multiple elements: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`, which is the expected output.
- List with different data types: `func_1([1, 'a', 3.5])` returns `(1, 'a', 3.5)`, which is the expected output.
- List with nested lists: `func_1([1, [2, 3], 4])` returns `(1, [2, 3], 4)`, which is the expected output.

In all cases, the function behaves as expected and correctly converts the input list to a tuple. Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
