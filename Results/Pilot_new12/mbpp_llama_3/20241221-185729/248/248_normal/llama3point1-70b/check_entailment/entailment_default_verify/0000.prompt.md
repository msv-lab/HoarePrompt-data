You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple for every potential case. The `tuple()` function in Python is designed to convert an iterable, such as a list, into a tuple. This function works as expected for all types of lists, including empty lists, lists containing different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats), and lists containing nested lists or other iterables.

The code does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It correctly handles the following scenarios:

- Empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`, which is the expected output.
- List with single element: `func_1([1])` returns `(1,)`, which is the expected output.
- List with multiple elements: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`, which is the expected output.
- List with different data types: `func_1([1, 'a', 3.5])` returns `(1, 'a', 3.5)`, which is the expected output.
- List with nested lists: `func_1([1, [2, 3], 4])` returns `(1, [2, 3], 4)`, which is the expected output.

In all cases, the function behaves as expected and correctly converts the input list to a tuple. Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements of the input list. The function does not modify the original input list, and it does not handle any potential edge cases such as an empty input list or a list containing unhashable types. The returned tuple will contain the same elements as the input list, in the same order, and will be immutable. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. If the input list contains any unhashable types, such as lists or dictionaries, the function will not raise an error, because tuples can contain mutable objects. The function will work correctly for any type of object that can be contained in a list, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
