Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, takes an input list and returns its tuple equivalent. This is achieved through the built-in `tuple()` function, which can convert an iterable (like a list) into a tuple.

The function works as expected for various input scenarios:
- When the input is an empty list, it correctly returns an empty tuple.
- When the input list contains a mix of data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings), the function correctly converts this list into a tuple, maintaining the data types of each element.
- The function also handles lists containing nested structures like lists or other tuples, converting the outer list into a tuple while leaving the inner structures unchanged.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: (1, 2, 3)
print(func_1([]))  # Expected output: ()
print(func_1(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Expected output: ('a', 'b', 'c')
print(func_1([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))  # Expected output: (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
print(func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))  # Expected output: ([1, 2], [3, 4])
```
All these test cases show that the function behaves as described in the problem statement, converting any given list into a tuple without altering the list's content or structure. Therefore, the program is considered correct for the given task.
