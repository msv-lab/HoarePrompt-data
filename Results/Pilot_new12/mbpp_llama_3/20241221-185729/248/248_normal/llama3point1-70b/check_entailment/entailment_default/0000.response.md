Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple containing all elements of the input list, in the same order, and does not modify the original input list. The function works correctly for any type of object that can be contained in a list, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples. It also handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple. Additionally, the function does not raise an error when the input list contains unhashable types, such as lists or dictionaries, because tuples can contain mutable objects. 

The code is straightforward and correctly implements the desired functionality. It does not attempt to handle any cases that are outside the scope of the problem description, and since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
