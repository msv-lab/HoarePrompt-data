Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple. The provided function, `func_1`, takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements of the input list. 

The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple. This means that the function will work correctly for any type of object that can be contained in a list, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples. 

Additionally, the function does not modify the original input list, which is in line with the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty tuple.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's lack of error handling for cases like non-list inputs or lists containing unhashable types does not affect its correctness with respect to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, making it correct.
