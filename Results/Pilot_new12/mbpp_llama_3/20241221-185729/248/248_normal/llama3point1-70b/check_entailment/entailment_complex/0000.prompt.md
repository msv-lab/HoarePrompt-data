You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list.
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)
    #The program returns a tuple that contains all the elements of the input_list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements of the input list. The function does not modify the original input list, and it does not handle any potential edge cases such as an empty input list or a list containing unhashable types. The returned tuple will contain the same elements as the input list, in the same order, and will be immutable. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. If the input list contains any unhashable types, such as lists or dictionaries, the function will not raise an error, because tuples can contain mutable objects. The function will work correctly for any type of object that can be contained in a list, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
