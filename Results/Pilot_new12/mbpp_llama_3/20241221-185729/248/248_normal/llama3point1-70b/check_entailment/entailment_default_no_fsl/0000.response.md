Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function takes an input list, uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert it into a tuple, and returns this tuple. 

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected: it does not modify the original list, does not handle edge cases such as an empty list (though the `tuple()` function can handle this), and does not raise an error when the list contains unhashable types like lists or dictionaries. 

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list), the function will work correctly for all potential cases, including lists containing strings, integers, floats, and other tuples, as well as empty lists. The function does not require any error checking or handling for invalid inputs because, by assumption, such inputs will not occur. 

Since the function's behavior matches the problem description for every potential valid input, and we assume valid inputs, the function can be considered correct.
