Functionality: **The function accepts a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements of the input list. The function does not modify the original input list, and it does not handle any potential edge cases such as an empty input list or a list containing unhashable types. The returned tuple will contain the same elements as the input list, in the same order, and will be immutable. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. If the input list contains any unhashable types, such as lists or dictionaries, the function will not raise an error, because tuples can contain mutable objects. The function will work correctly for any type of object that can be contained in a list, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples.**
