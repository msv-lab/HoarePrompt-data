#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple that contains all elements from the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list parameter `lst` and returns a tuple containing all elements from `lst`. The input list remains unchanged, and the function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of any data type. The returned tuple is a new object, and its elements are references to the original elements in the input list, preserving their original order.
