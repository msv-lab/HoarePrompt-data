You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)
assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)

def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list to a tuple. 

This function is correct because it handles every potential case as described in the problem. It correctly converts lists of different lengths and containing different types of elements to tuples. The unit tests provided in the program also demonstrate its correctness for various inputs.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It works as expected for all possible inputs, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing different data types. 

For example, the following test cases would also pass:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`
- A list with duplicate elements: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)`
- A list with elements of different data types: `func_1([1, 'a', 2.5, True])` returns `(1, 'a', 2.5, True)`

Therefore, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list parameter `lst` and returns a tuple containing all elements from `lst`. The input list remains unchanged, and the function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of any data type. The returned tuple is a new object, and its elements are references to the original elements in the input list, preserving their original order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
