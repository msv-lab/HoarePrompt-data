Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple.
3. The function then returns this tuple, which contains all elements from the input list.
4. The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves correctly for different lists.

Since the function correctly converts any input list to a tuple and returns it, and considering the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list), the program meets the problem description for every potential case.
