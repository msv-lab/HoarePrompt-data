Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. It uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which takes an iterable (such as a list) and returns a tuple containing all elements from the iterable. The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of any data type.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, preserving their original order. The returned tuple is a new object, and its elements are references to the original elements in the input list.

Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or is empty. The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly for various input cases.

Therefore, the code meets the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
