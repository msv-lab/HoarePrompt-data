Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it simply converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. This function works for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: `tuple([])` returns `()`, which is the expected output.
- Lists with duplicate elements: `tuple([1, 2, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 2, 3)`, preserving the original order and duplicate elements.
- Lists containing elements of any data type: `tuple([1, 'a', 2.5, True])` returns `(1, 'a', 2.5, True)`, handling mixed data types correctly.

The function `func_1` does not modify the original list and returns a new tuple object, which agrees with the output hints. The elements in the returned tuple are references to the original elements in the input list, which is the expected behavior in Python.

Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., a list), the function works correctly for all potential cases without any errors.
