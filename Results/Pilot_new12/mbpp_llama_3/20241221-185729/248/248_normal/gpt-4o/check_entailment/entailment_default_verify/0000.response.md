The original assessment is that the program is correct, and upon reviewing the code, problem description, and output hints, I agree with this assessment. 

The problem description requires a function to convert a list to a tuple. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple using the `tuple()` function. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, preserving the original order of elements, handling empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of any data type.

One of the key points to consider is that the program uses the `tuple()` function to convert the list to a tuple. This function is a built-in Python function that creates a tuple from an iterable, which includes lists. It does not modify the original list and returns a new tuple object, which is a requirement of the problem description.

Additionally, the program's handling of edge cases is also correct. The function can handle lists of any length, including empty lists. It can also handle lists with duplicate elements, as the `tuple()` function preserves the original order of elements. Furthermore, the function can handle lists containing elements of any data type, as the `tuple()` function does not impose any restrictions on the type of elements.

The output hints also confirm that the function works as expected. They state that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, preserving their original order, and handling all potential edge cases. The output hints also clarify that the input list remains unchanged and that the returned tuple is a new object, which is a critical requirement of the problem description.

Based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program meets all the requirements of the problem description, handles edge cases correctly, and preserves the original order of elements. 

Final: **True**
