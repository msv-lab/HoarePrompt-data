Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python to convert the list into a tuple. 

This program meets the problem description's requirements for every potential case, as it can handle any list of any length and containing any type of elements. The `tuple()` function does not have any relevant limitations that would prevent it from working correctly in any case. The function does not make any assumptions about the input list, and it does not have any potential edge cases that are not handled.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly for various inputs. Since we cannot think of any example where the program does not work as expected according to the description, we conclude that the program is correct.
