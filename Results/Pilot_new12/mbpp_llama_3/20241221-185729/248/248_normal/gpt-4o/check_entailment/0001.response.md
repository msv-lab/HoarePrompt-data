Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list to a tuple. 

This function is correct because it handles every potential case as described in the problem. It correctly converts lists of different lengths and containing different types of elements to tuples. The unit tests provided in the program also demonstrate its correctness for various inputs.

The function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It works as expected for all possible inputs, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing different data types. 

For example, the following test cases would also pass:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`
- A list with duplicate elements: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)`
- A list with elements of different data types: `func_1([1, 'a', 2.5, True])` returns `(1, 'a', 2.5, True)`

Therefore, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
