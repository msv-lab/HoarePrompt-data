Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to convert a list to a tuple as described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple.
3. The converted tuple is then returned by the function.

This implementation meets the requirements of the problem description:

* It takes a list as input.
* It returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list.
* The input list remains unchanged.
* The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing elements of any data type.
* The returned tuple is a new object, and its elements are references to the original elements in the input list, preserving their original order.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for various test cases, including lists with different lengths and elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the function to convert a list to a tuple, meeting all the requirements specified in the problem description.
