According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `lst` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The length of `lst` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
