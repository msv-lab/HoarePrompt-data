The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns `False` in Cases 1, 2, and 3. In Case 4, the function returns `True`, indicating that either no odd index in `lst` contains an even value, or the function does not check for this condition based on the provided return statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return a boolean value based on the conditions checked in the function body, with `True` indicating a specific condition is met and `False` otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, returns `True` if a specific condition is met, and `False` otherwise.**
