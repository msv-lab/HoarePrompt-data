#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function will return False if there exists an odd index `i` in `lst` such that `lst[i]` is even; otherwise, the function will complete without returning a value (implicitly returning None), and `i` will be equal to the last index in `lst` (which is `len(lst) - 1`), and `lst` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that either no odd index in `lst` contains an even value, or the function does not check for this condition based on the provided return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks if there exists an odd index `i` in `lst` such that `lst[i]` is even. If such a condition is met, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such condition is met after iterating through all indices in `lst`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices in `lst` contain odd values. The function does not modify the input list `lst` in any way. After the function concludes, the input list `lst` remains unchanged, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition was met (`False`) or not (`True`). The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists (which would implicitly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check) and lists with even lengths (where the last index is even and thus not checked by the function).
