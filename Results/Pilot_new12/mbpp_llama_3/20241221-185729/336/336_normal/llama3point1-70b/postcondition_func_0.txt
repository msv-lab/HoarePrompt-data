The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks if there exists an odd index `i` in `lst` such that `lst[i]` is even. If such a condition is met, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such condition is met after iterating through all indices in `lst`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices in `lst` contain odd values. The function does not modify the input list `lst` in any way. After the function concludes, the input list `lst` remains unchanged, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition was met (`False`) or not (`True`). The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists (which would implicitly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check) and lists with even lengths (where the last index is even and thus not checked by the function).
