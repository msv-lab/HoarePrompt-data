You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function will return False if there exists an odd index `i` in `lst` such that `lst[i]` is even; otherwise, the function will complete without returning a value (implicitly returning None), and `i` will be equal to the last index in `lst` (which is `len(lst) - 1`), and `lst` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that either no odd index in `lst` contains an even value, or the function does not check for this condition based on the provided return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks if there exists an odd index `i` in `lst` such that `lst[i]` is even. If such a condition is met, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such condition is met after iterating through all indices in `lst`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices in `lst` contain odd values. The function does not modify the input list `lst` in any way. After the function concludes, the input list `lst` remains unchanged, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition was met (`False`) or not (`True`). The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty lists (which would implicitly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check) and lists with even lengths (where the last index is even and thus not checked by the function).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
