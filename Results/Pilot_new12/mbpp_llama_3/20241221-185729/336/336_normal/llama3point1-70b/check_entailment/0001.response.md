Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks each index to see if it is odd (i.e., `i % 2!= 0`). If an odd index is found and the corresponding value in the list is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

*   Empty lists: The function will return `True` for an empty list because there are no odd indices to check.
*   Lists with only even indices: The function will return `True` for such lists because there are no odd indices to check.
*   Lists with odd indices containing odd numbers: The function will return `True` for such lists because all odd indices contain odd numbers.
*   Lists with odd indices containing even numbers: The function will return `False` for such lists because not all odd indices contain odd numbers.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, its correctness can be confirmed.
