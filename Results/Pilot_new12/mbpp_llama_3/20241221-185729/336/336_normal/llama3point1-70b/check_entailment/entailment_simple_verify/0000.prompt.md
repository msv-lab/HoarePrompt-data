You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function iterates over the list using a for loop, checking each index `i`.
2. The condition `if i % 2!= 0` verifies whether the current index is odd. If it's not odd, the function moves on to the next iteration.
3. If the index is odd, the function checks whether the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even value at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any even values at odd indices, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

To verify the correctness of the function, consider the following test cases:

* An empty list: The function returns `True`, which is correct because there are no odd indices to check.
* A list with only one element (at index 0, which is even): The function returns `True`, which is correct because there are no odd indices to check.
* A list with multiple elements, where every odd index contains an odd number: The function returns `True`, which is correct.
* A list with multiple elements, where an odd index contains an even number: The function returns `False`, which is correct.

After analyzing the function and considering various test cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the desired behavior. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function will return False if there exists an odd index `i` in `lst` such that `lst[i]` is even; otherwise, the function will complete without returning a value (implicitly returning None), and `i` will be equal to the last index in `lst` (which is `len(lst) - 1`), and `lst` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that either no odd index in `lst` contains an even value, or the function does not check for this condition based on the provided return statement.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
