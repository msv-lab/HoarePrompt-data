Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates over the indices of the list using `range(len(lst))`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If such a condition is met (i.e., an odd index contains an even value), the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If no such condition is met after iterating through all indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd values.

The program handles all potential edge cases, including:

* Empty lists: The function will implicitly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check.
* Lists with even lengths: The function will not check the last index (which is even) since it only checks odd indices.

The program does not modify the input list `lst` in any way and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition was met.

Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential edge cases, it is correct.
