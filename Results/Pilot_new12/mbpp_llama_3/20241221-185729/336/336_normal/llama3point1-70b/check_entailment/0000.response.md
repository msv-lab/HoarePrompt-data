Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function iterates over the list using a for loop, checking each index `i`.
2. The condition `if i % 2!= 0` verifies whether the current index is odd. If it's not odd, the function moves on to the next iteration.
3. If the index is odd, the function checks whether the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even value at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any even values at odd indices, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

To verify the correctness of the function, consider the following test cases:

* An empty list: The function returns `True`, which is correct because there are no odd indices to check.
* A list with only one element (at index 0, which is even): The function returns `True`, which is correct because there are no odd indices to check.
* A list with multiple elements, where every odd index contains an odd number: The function returns `True`, which is correct.
* A list with multiple elements, where an odd index contains an even number: The function returns `False`, which is correct.

After analyzing the function and considering various test cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the desired behavior. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
