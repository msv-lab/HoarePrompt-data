Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks whether every odd index contains an odd number of a given list. The function `func_1` iterates through each index of the input list `lst`. If it encounters an odd index `i` where the corresponding value `lst[i]` is even, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding such a case, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The code handles all potential edge cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: Since there are no odd indices in an empty list, the function returns `True` as expected.
- Lists with even lengths: The last index of such a list is even and thus is not checked by the function, which is in line with the problem description.
- Lists with only one element: If the list has only one element (at index 0, which is even), the function returns `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
- Lists with multiple elements where all odd indices have odd values: The function correctly returns `True` in such cases.
- Lists with multiple elements where at least one odd index has an even value: The function correctly returns `False` in such cases.

Given the function's logic and the problem description, it appears that the code accurately implements the desired functionality and does not have any obvious gaps in handling potential cases. Therefore, the code is correct based on the problem description provided.
