Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list using a for loop, checking each index `i` and its corresponding value `lst[i]`. 

If the index `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2!= 0`) and the value at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not every odd index contains an odd number.

If the function completes the loop without finding any odd index with an even value, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

Since the function correctly checks the condition for every odd index in the list and returns the correct result based on the problem description, it is correct.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function iterates through each index `i` in the list `lst`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd by using the condition `i % 2!= 0`.
3. If `i` is odd, it then checks if the value at index `i` is even by using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`.
4. If an odd index `i` with an even value is found, the function immediately returns `False`.
5. If the function completes the loop without finding any odd index with an even value, it returns `True`.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the condition specified in the problem description, making it correct.
