The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, 
the function returns `False` under Cases 1, 2, and 3. 
However, in Case 4, the function returns `True` if `lst` has at least one element and no even elements were found at odd indices. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` if the list meets certain conditions (has at least one element and no even elements at odd indices), otherwise return `False`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, returns `True` if the list has at least one element and no even elements at odd indices, otherwise returns `False`.**
