Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers has at least one element and no even elements at odd indices. It accepts a list of integers `lst` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list meets these conditions. If the list is empty or has an even element at an odd index, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function does not modify the input list and only checks for even elements at odd indices, ignoring elements at even indices. The variable `i` is used to store the current index during the loop, but its final value is not returned or used outside the function. The function's return value is the primary indicator of its result, with `True` indicating that the list has at least one element and no even elements were found at odd indices, and `False` indicating otherwise.**
