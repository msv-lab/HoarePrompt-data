Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks if every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. The function `func_1` iterates through the list, starting from the second element (at index 1) and checks if the element is odd. If an even element is found at an odd index, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function only checks for even elements at odd indices, ignoring elements at even indices. The function does not modify the input list and only returns a boolean value indicating whether the list meets the condition.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior:

* `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: Every odd index contains an odd number.
* `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: Every odd index contains an odd number.
* `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The second element (at index 1) is even.

The code handles every potential case correctly, as it only checks the elements at odd indices and returns `True` if all of them are odd, and `False` otherwise. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the function does not need to handle edge cases such as empty lists or non-list inputs.
