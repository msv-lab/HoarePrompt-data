Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list, starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks every other element (i.e., every odd index). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it:

*   Iterates over the correct indices (every odd index) using a step size of 2 in the `range` function.
*   Correctly checks if the number at each index is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0, the number is even, and the function returns `False`.
*   Returns `True` only if all odd indices have been checked and no even numbers were found.

All the provided assertions pass, and the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Without finding a counterexample where the function does not work as expected, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
