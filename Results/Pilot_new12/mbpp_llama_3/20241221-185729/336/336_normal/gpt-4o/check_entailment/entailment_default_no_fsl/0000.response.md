Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the function described in the problem. It checks every odd index of the input list to ensure it contains an odd number. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding an even number, it returns `True`.

The loop `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):` correctly iterates over the odd indices of the list (since list indices in Python start at 0), and `if lst[i] % 2 == 0:` checks if the number at the current odd index is even. The function handles lists of varying lengths and does not modify the input list.

The output hints agree with the functionality of the code, indicating that the function should return `False` for an empty list or a list with an even element at an odd index, and `True` otherwise.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function:

- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` checks a list where all odd indices have odd numbers.
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` checks a list where the only odd index has an odd number.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` would be an incorrect test for the problem description since the second index (which is odd, index 1) has an even number, which aligns with the function returning `False` for this case, but this contradicts the problem statement that every odd index should contain an odd number. However, considering the implementation, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the test case, as the function is correctly implemented based on its described functionality, not the problem description provided.

Given the code's implementation and its matching with the provided unit tests and output hints (apart from the potential misunderstanding in the test case descriptions), the function appears to be correct under the assumption that valid inputs are provided and the goal is to check for odd numbers at odd indices as implemented.
