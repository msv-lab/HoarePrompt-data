Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment makes sense. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. 

The annotated version of the code confirms the correctness of the original assessment. It clearly states the state of the program before the function call, which is that `lst` is a list of integers. The annotation after the for loop has been executed also correctly describes the state of the program, indicating that `i` equals `len(lst)` if `lst` has at least one element and no even elements were found at odd indices.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the function correctly implements the required logic. It iterates over the odd indices of the list using a step size of 2 in the `range` function, and it checks if the number at each index is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`. 

Additionally, the provided assertions pass, and the function behaves as expected for different inputs. There is no evidence to suggest that the function does not work as expected for any valid input.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:
Final: **True**
