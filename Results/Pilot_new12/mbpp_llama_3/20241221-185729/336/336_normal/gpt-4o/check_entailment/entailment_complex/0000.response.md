Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the list `lst` starting from the first odd index (1) and checks every odd index.
2. For each odd index `i`, it checks if the element at that index is even by using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`.
3. If it finds an even element at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even elements, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The program does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or is an empty list, as per the problem statement. The program also does not need to check elements at even indices, as the problem description only asks about odd indices.

The provided assertions also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: Every odd index (1, 3, 5, 7) contains an odd number (1, 3, 7, 3), so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: Every odd index (1) contains an odd number (1), so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The odd index (1) contains an even number (2), so the function returns `False`. However, upon closer inspection, this assertion seems to be incorrect based on the given description, because the question asks if every odd index contains an odd number, and in this case, the first index (which is an odd index, considering 0 as an even index) contains a 1, which is an odd number, and there is no other odd index. Therefore, the function should actually return True for this case, indicating that the assertion might be flawed, but the program itself is correct according to its description. The program checks for the condition as described and correctly identifies if at odd indices there are odd numbers. The description of the function and its behavior match the provided problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and assertions.
