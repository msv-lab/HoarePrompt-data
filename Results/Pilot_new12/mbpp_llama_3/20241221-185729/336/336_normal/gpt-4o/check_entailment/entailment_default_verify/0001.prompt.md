You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list, starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks every other element (i.e., every odd index). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it:

*   Iterates over the correct indices (every odd index) using a step size of 2 in the `range` function.
*   Correctly checks if the number at each index is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0, the number is even, and the function returns `False`.
*   Returns `True` only if all odd indices have been checked and no even numbers were found.

All the provided assertions pass, and the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Without finding a counterexample where the function does not work as expected, it can be concluded that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers has at least one element and no even elements at odd indices. It accepts a list of integers `lst` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list meets these conditions. If the list is empty or has an even element at an odd index, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function does not modify the input list and only checks for even elements at odd indices, ignoring elements at even indices. The variable `i` is used to store the current index during the loop, but its final value is not returned or used outside the function. The function's return value is the primary indicator of its result, with `True` indicating that the list has at least one element and no even elements were found at odd indices, and `False` indicating otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
