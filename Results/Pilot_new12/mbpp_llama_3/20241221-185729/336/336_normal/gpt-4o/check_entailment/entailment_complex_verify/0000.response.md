The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Upon reviewing the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, it's clear that the function indeed iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element to ensure they are odd. If any of these elements are even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The annotated version of the code supports this interpretation, detailing the state of the program before and after the function call, as well as the conditions under which the function returns `True` or `False`. The annotations suggest that the function does not check for the list being empty explicitly but implicitly handles this case by returning `True` for a list with at least one element if no even elements are found at odd indices.

Given the assumptions made in the problem statement (i.e., the input will always be a valid, non-empty list of integers), the original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct seems to align with both the problem description and the provided code. The unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness under various scenarios, including lists with odd and even numbers at odd indices.

However, it's worth noting that the original assessment does not explicitly address the handling of edge cases such as an empty list. Nonetheless, based on the provided information and the assumption of valid input, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment that the program is correct holds true under the given assumptions.

Final: **True**
