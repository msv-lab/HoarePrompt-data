Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks if every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. Here is why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and iterates over its elements with a step size of 2, starting from the second element (index 1). This ensures that only elements at odd indices are checked.

2. Inside the loop, the program checks if the current element `lst[i]` is even by using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If the element is even, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not every odd index contains an odd number.

3. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly because it:

- Checks every element at an odd index.
- Returns `False` as soon as it finds an even element at an odd index.
- Returns `True` if it checks all elements at odd indices without finding any even elements.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and will always produce the correct result for any valid input list.
