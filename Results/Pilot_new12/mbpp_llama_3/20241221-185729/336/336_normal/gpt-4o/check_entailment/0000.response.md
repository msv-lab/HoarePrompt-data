Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list, starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (with a step size of 2) to ensure that they are odd. If any of these elements are even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`, indicating that the condition is met.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: The odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) contain the numbers 1, 3, 7, and 3, all of which are odd. The function returns `True` as expected.
* `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: The only odd index (1) contains the number 1, which is odd. The function returns `True` as expected.
* `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The odd index (1) contains the number 2, which is even. The function returns `False` as expected.

After examining the code and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the described behavior, and no counterexamples can be found. Therefore, the program is correct.
