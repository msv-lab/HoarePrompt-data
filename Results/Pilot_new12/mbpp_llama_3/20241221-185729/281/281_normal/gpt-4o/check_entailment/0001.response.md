Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, it means the number is even, and it is included in the output list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) cover various cases, including lists with both even and odd numbers, and the function correctly identifies the even numbers in each case.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists containing only even numbers
* Lists containing only odd numbers (in which case the function would return an empty list)
* Lists containing a mix of even and odd numbers
* Lists containing zero (which is an even number)
* Lists with negative numbers (although not explicitly tested, the modulo operation would still work correctly for negative numbers)

Since the function uses a simple and well-defined mathematical operation to determine if a number is even, and it iterates over all elements in the input list, it is likely that the function works correctly for all possible inputs. Without being able to find a specific case where the function does not work as expected, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
