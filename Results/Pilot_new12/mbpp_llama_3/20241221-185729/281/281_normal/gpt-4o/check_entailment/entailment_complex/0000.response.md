To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**: The problem description requires writing a Python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. This implies the function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list containing only the even integers.

2. **Program Analysis**: The provided Python function `func_1` does the following:
   - It accepts a list of integers `numbers`.
   - It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the `numbers` list.
   - For each number, it checks the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which is true if the number is even.
   - It returns a new list containing only the numbers for which the condition is true, i.e., the even numbers.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find even numbers from a given list of integers.
   - The use of list comprehension ensures that a new list is created without modifying the original list, which meets the problem's requirements.
   - The function handles lists with any combination of even and odd numbers correctly, as demonstrated by the provided assertions.
   - The program implicitly handles the case where the input list is empty, as the list comprehension will simply return an empty list if there are no numbers to process.
   - The condition `num % 2 == 0` is a standard and correct way to check if a number is even, covering all positive and negative even integers.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the program correctly identifies even numbers from any list of integers, does not modify the original list, and handles edge cases appropriately (including empty lists and lists with no even numbers), it fully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
