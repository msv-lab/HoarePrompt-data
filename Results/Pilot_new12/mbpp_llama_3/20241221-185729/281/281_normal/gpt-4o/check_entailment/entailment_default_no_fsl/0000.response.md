Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description, which requires finding even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. 

This is achieved through a list comprehension that checks each number in the input list to see if it is even (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). If a number is even, it is included in the output list; otherwise, it is not. The function handles any list of integers, including empty lists, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

The output hints provided also align with the functionality of the code. The function does not modify the original list and returns an empty list if the input list is empty or contains no even integers. Given the constraints that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function should work correctly for all expected inputs. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover various scenarios and all pass as expected.
