Based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints, I have analyzed the program's correctness. The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon further evaluation, I agree with this assessment.

The problem description requires a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). This approach is mathematically sound and correctly identifies even numbers.

The output hints support the correctness of the program by stating that it accepts a list of integers as input, returns a new list containing only the even integers, and handles various edge cases, such as empty lists, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers.

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the code's behavior, including its handling of different input scenarios, such as lists containing both even and odd numbers, and its correct identification of even numbers in each case.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct. The provided code accurately implements the required functionality, and the output hints confirm its correct behavior.

Final: **True**
