Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of even numbers from the input list. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`.
- For each number `num`, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This is the correct condition to check if a number is even.
- If the number is even, it is included in the output list.
- The function returns the list of even numbers.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works as expected. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which are the even numbers in the input list. 

Since the function correctly identifies and returns the even numbers from the input list for every potential case, and assuming that the input will always be a valid list of integers, the program is correct.
