The original assessment states that the program is correct, and I agree with this assessment. The provided Python function `func_1` uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers that are even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). This logic is sound and should work for all possible lists of numbers.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, as it clearly states that the function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The annotations also confirm that the function does not modify the original list and handles edge cases such as empty lists, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers.

The test cases provided also support the original assessment, as they demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. For example, the test case `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]` shows that the function correctly identifies the even numbers in the list.

I maintain the original assessment because the annotated version of the code and the test cases provided confirm that the function is working as expected. The function's logic is sound, and it handles various input scenarios correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
