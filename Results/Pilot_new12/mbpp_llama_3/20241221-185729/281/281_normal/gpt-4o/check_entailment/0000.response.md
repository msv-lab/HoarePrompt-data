Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is used to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers that are even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`).

The function works correctly for all the provided test cases, and it also handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with only one element, or a list with no even numbers. 

The reason why this function is correct is that it checks each number in the list to see if it is even, and if it is, it adds it to the new list. This logic is sound and should work for all possible lists of numbers.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, it will return `[2, 4]`, which are the even numbers in the list. Similarly, if we call `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])`, it will return `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which are the even numbers in that list.

In general, the function `func_1` works as expected and should return the correct list of even numbers for any input list. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
