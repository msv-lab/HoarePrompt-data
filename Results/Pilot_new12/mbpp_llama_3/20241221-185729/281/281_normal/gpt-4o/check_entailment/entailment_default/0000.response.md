Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. The function handles various cases, including empty lists, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]` and `assert func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]`, demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list and handles various edge cases. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs, such as non-list inputs or non-integer values within the list. 

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description and handles various potential cases as expected.
