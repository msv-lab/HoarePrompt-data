#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the 'numbers' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. It does not modify the original list and handles any list of integers, including empty lists, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers. The function will return an empty list if the input list is empty or contains no even integers.
