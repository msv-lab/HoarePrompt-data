Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list, effectively filtering out all odd integers. The original list remains unchanged. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains no even integers, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.**
