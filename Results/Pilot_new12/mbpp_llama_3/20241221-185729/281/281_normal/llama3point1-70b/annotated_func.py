#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the 'numbers' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list, effectively filtering out all odd integers. The original list remains unchanged. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains no even integers, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.
