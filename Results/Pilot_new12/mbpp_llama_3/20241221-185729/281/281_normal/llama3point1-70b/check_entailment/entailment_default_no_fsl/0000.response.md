Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the odd integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The original list remains unchanged.

The function handles the cases mentioned in the output hints correctly:
- If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
- If the input list contains no even integers, the function returns an empty list.

Given the assumption that the input will be a non-empty list of integers (as stated in the instructions), the function will work correctly for all valid inputs, returning a list of even numbers. The code correctly implements the logic for identifying even numbers using the modulo operator (`%`), ensuring that only numbers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 are included in the output list.

The output hints align with the code's functionality, providing examples of the function's behavior under different scenarios without indicating any failure to meet the problem description's requirements. Therefore, under the given assumptions, the code is correct for all expected inputs and scenarios.
