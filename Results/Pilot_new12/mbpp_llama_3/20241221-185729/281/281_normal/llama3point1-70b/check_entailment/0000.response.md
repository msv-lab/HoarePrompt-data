Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(numbers)` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. It checks if a number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which is a standard way to check for even numbers in Python. If the condition is true, the number is included in the output list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly identifies even numbers and includes them in the output list.
- It correctly ignores odd numbers and does not include them in the output list.
- It handles empty input lists by returning an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
- It handles lists containing non-integer values by attempting to perform the modulo operation, which will raise a TypeError if the list contains non-integer values. However, this is not explicitly stated as an incorrect behavior in the problem description, and it is a reasonable assumption that the input list contains only integers.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
