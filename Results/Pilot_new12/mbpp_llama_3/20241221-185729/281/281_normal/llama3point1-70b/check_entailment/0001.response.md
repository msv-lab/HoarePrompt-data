Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to filter even numbers from a list of numbers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number `num`, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 (`num % 2`) equals 0, which is the condition for a number to be even. If this condition is met, the number is included in the output list.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists containing both even and odd numbers.
- Lists containing only even numbers.
- Lists containing only odd numbers (in which case an empty list is returned, as expected).
- Empty lists (where the function will return an empty list, which aligns with the expectation of finding no even numbers).
- Lists containing non-integer values (though, in Python, attempting to use the modulus operator `%` with non-integer values will work correctly for floats and complex numbers, but the result may not be what the user expects if they're not aware of this behavior).

Since the function works as intended for all these cases and does not have any apparent logical errors or unhandled edge cases related to its stated purpose (finding even numbers from a list), the program is considered correct.
