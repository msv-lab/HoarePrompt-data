Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each number in the input list and checks whether it is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If a number is even, it is included in the new list; otherwise, it is skipped.

The output hints provided agree with the code and describe its behavior accurately. The function filters out odd integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, the function correctly returns an empty list.

Given the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the code works as expected for every potential case. It correctly identifies and returns even numbers from the input list, handles empty lists by returning an empty list, and does not modify the original list. The code does not need to explicitly handle potential errors such as non-integer values or non-list inputs because, as per the problem statement, we assume the input will always be valid. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and the assumption of valid input, the code is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
