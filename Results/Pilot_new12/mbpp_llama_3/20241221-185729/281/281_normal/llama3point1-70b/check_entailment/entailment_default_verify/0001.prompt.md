You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to filter even numbers from a list of numbers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number `num`, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 (`num % 2`) equals 0, which is the condition for a number to be even. If this condition is met, the number is included in the output list.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists containing both even and odd numbers.
- Lists containing only even numbers.
- Lists containing only odd numbers (in which case an empty list is returned, as expected).
- Empty lists (where the function will return an empty list, which aligns with the expectation of finding no even numbers).
- Lists containing non-integer values (though, in Python, attempting to use the modulus operator `%` with non-integer values will work correctly for floats and complex numbers, but the result may not be what the user expects if they're not aware of this behavior).

Since the function works as intended for all these cases and does not have any apparent logical errors or unhandled edge cases related to its stated purpose (finding even numbers from a list), the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list, effectively filtering out all odd integers. The original list remains unchanged. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains no even integers, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
