Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. It filters a list of integers to return only the even numbers, which is what the problem asks for. 

Here's why the program is correct:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers.
- It checks if each number in the list is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which is the correct way to determine if a number is even.
- The function returns a new list containing only the even integers, effectively filtering out all odd integers. The original list remains unchanged, as required.
- If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which meets the problem description.
- If the input list contains no even integers, the function will also return an empty list, again meeting the problem description.

The program does exactly what the problem description asks for, which is to find even numbers from a list of numbers, making it correct.
