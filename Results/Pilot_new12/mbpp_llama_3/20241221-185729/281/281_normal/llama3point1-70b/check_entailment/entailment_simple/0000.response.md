Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of even integers from the input list.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number `num` in the list, it checks if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is equal to 0 using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
3. If the condition is true, the number is even, and it is included in the output list.
4. The function returns the list of even numbers.

This implementation correctly identifies even numbers from the input list, as required by the problem description. Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers), the program will always produce the correct output.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function will return `[2, 4, 6]`, which are the even numbers from the input list. This correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
