Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing `b` and `a`, effectively reversing their order. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The function does not need to handle edge cases such as non-numeric input, very large or very small numbers, or special values like NaN or infinity because the problem description assumes that the input will be valid. The function simply returns the two numbers in reverse order, without modifying the original values of `a` and `b`.

In every potential case where the input is two numbers, the function will correctly return a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
