Correctness: **True**

The problem description asks for a function that takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that does exactly this. It takes in two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, effectively reversing the order of the input numbers.

The output hints mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern. Additionally, the hints mention that the function does not handle edge cases such as non-numeric input, but again, we assume that the input will always be numbers.

In every potential case where the input is valid (i.e., two numbers), the function will return the correct output, which is a tuple with the second number and then the first number. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is confirmed.
