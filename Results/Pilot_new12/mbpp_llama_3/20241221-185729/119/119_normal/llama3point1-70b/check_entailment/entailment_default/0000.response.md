Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code originally looks correct. The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are numbers, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., b and a, without modifying the original values of a and b. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The output hints also agree with the code and do not indicate any potential cases where the function may not work correctly. Additionally, the problem description does not provide any examples that would suggest the function is incorrect. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs.
