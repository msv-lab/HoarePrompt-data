Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function is simple, yet it covers all potential cases. 

For example, if you call `func_1(1, 2)`, it will return `(2, 1)`, which is the expected output. Similarly, if you call `func_1(5, 10)`, it will return `(10, 5)`, which is also the expected output.

There are no edge cases that the function does not handle. The function works with any two numbers, whether they are positive, negative, or zero. It also works with non-integer numbers, such as floats.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
