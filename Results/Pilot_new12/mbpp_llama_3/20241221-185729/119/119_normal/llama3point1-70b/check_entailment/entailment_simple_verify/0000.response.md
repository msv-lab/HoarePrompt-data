To determine the correctness of the program, we need to compare the problem description with the provided code and its annotated version.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

The original code is:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```

The annotated version of the code is:
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns two numbers, b and a
```

The original assessment claims that the function is correct because it takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated version, it seems that the function actually returns two separate numbers `b` and `a` instead of a tuple. In Python, when a function uses the `return` keyword with multiple values separated by commas, it returns a tuple by default. But in the annotated version, the comment at the end says "The program returns two numbers, b and a", which could be misleading.

Despite this, the key point is that the function does indeed return `b` and then `a`, and in Python, `return b, a` is equivalent to `return (b, a)`. Both return a tuple, which is what the problem description asks for.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The function works as expected, returning a tuple with the second number and then the first number, regardless of the comment in the annotated version.

Final: **True**
