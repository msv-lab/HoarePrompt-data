You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Upon examining the code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly. For example, if we call `func_1(1, 2)`, it returns `(2, 1)`, which is the expected output. Similarly, if we call `func_1(-3, 4)`, it returns `(4, -3)`, which is also correct.

The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. It simply constructs and returns a tuple with the input numbers in the desired order.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, it seems that the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are numbers, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., b and a, without modifying the original values of a and b. The function does not perform any error checking or handling, so it assumes that the input parameters will always be numbers. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as non-numeric input, very large or very small numbers, or special values like NaN or infinity. After the function executes, the state of the program will be that the values of b and a will be returned, and the original values of a and b will remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
