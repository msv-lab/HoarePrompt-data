Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

In Python, when a function returns multiple values separated by commas, it is equivalent to returning a tuple with those values. In this case, the function returns `b, a`, which is equivalent to returning a tuple `(b, a)`. Therefore, the function is correctly implementing the required behavior.

Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases, and we assume that the input will always be valid, the program is correct for all potential cases. It will always return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, regardless of the input values.
