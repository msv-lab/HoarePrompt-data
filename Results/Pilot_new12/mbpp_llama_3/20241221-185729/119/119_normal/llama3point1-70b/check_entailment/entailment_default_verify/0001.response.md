The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with this assessment. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`, which meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., `b` and `a`, without modifying the original values of `a` and `b`. The hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The code is straightforward and simple, and it handles all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the examples provided in the original assessment. The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program is correct, and it will produce the expected output for all possible valid inputs.

Final: **True**
