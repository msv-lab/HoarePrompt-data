Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Upon examining the code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly. For example, if we call `func_1(1, 2)`, it returns `(2, 1)`, which is the expected output. Similarly, if we call `func_1(-3, 4)`, it returns `(4, -3)`, which is also correct.

The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops that could potentially lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. It simply constructs and returns a tuple with the input numbers in the desired order.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, it seems that the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
