Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are numbers, and returns them in reverse order, i.e., b and a, without modifying the original values of a and b. The function does not perform any error checking or handling, so it assumes that the input parameters will always be numbers. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as non-numeric input, very large or very small numbers, or special values like NaN or infinity. After the function executes, the state of the program will be that the values of b and a will be returned, and the original values of a and b will remain unchanged.**
