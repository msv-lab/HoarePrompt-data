#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns two numbers, b and a
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and returns a tuple containing the two numbers in reverse order, `b` followed by `a`. This functionality holds true for all possible numeric input combinations of `a` and `b`, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as floating-point numbers. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, implying that it assumes `a` and `b` will always be numbers. After the function concludes, the state of the program is updated with the returned values, which can be used as needed in the subsequent code. The function does not modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside of the function scope, maintaining their original state.
