Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, but as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. The function works correctly for all possible numeric input combinations, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as floating-point numbers. The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function returns a tuple containing the two numbers in reverse order. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Overall, the function meets the problem description and works as expected for every potential case.
