Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to return a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`. This is exactly what the function does: `return (b, a)`. 

This functionality works for all potential cases, including the provided unit tests: 
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which matches the expectation.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which also matches.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, again matching the expectation.

Given that the function directly achieves the described goal without adding any conditional logic that might introduce edge cases, it is reasonable to conclude that it works as expected for all inputs. Since no specific constraints are mentioned (like only positive numbers, integers, etc.), and Python tuples can handle any type of object, the function should work correctly for any two arguments.
