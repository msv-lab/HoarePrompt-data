You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

def func_1(a, b):
    return (b, a)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to return a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`. This is exactly what the function does: `return (b, a)`. 

This functionality works for all potential cases, including the provided unit tests: 
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which matches the expectation.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which also matches.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, again matching the expectation.

Given that the function directly achieves the described goal without adding any conditional logic that might introduce edge cases, it is reasonable to conclude that it works as expected for all inputs. Since no specific constraints are mentioned (like only positive numbers, integers, etc.), and Python tuples can handle any type of object, the function should work correctly for any two arguments.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and returns a tuple containing the two numbers in reverse order, `b` followed by `a`. This functionality holds true for all possible numeric input combinations of `a` and `b`, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as floating-point numbers. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, implying that it assumes `a` and `b` will always be numbers. After the function concludes, the state of the program is updated with the returned values, which can be used as needed in the subsequent code. The function does not modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside of the function scope, maintaining their original state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
