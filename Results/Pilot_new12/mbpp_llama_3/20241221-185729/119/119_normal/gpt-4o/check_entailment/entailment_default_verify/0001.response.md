The original assessment is accurate, and it makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple where the second number `b` is followed by the first number `a`, which meets the problem description exactly.

The output hints provided further support this assessment by confirming that the function works as intended for all numeric input combinations, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as floating-point numbers. They also clarify that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, which is in line with the assumption that the user will always provide valid numeric inputs.

Given that the function's implementation is straightforward and correctly implements the required behavior, and considering the output hints that verify its functionality for various numeric inputs, there is no evidence to suggest that the program does not meet the problem description.

Therefore, based on the given information, the program is correct, and the original assessment remains unchanged.

Final: **True**
