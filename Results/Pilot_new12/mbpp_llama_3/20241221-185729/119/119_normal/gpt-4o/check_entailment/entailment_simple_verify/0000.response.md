Based on the provided information, the original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The function `func_1(a, b)` achieves this by returning `(b, a)`, which directly addresses the problem statement.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. Before the function call, `a` and `b` are indeed numbers, aligning with the problem's input expectation. The function then returns `b` and `a`, as required, which also matches the statement in the annotated version that "The program returns two numbers, b and a."

The unit tests provided (`assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`) further validate the function's correctness by demonstrating its behavior with different inputs, all of which align with the expected output.

Given that the function directly implements the required functionality without any conditional logic that could introduce errors, and considering the assumption that the input will always be valid (two numbers), the original assessment that the program is correct remains accurate.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, is that the program works as intended and meets the requirements specified.

Final: **True**
