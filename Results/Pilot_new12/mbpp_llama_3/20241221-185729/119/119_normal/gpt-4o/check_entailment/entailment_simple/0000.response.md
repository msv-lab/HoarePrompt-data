Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. 

The function `func_1(a, b)` simply returns `b, a`, which is a tuple containing the two input numbers in the desired order. The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different input values.

Since the program assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., two numbers), it does not need to include any error checking or handling code. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description. 

In general, the function will work correctly for any two valid input numbers, and it will always return a tuple with the second number first and the first number second, as required.
