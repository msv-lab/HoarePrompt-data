Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This matches the problem description, which asks for a function that returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

The output hints suggest that the function works correctly for all possible numeric input combinations, including positive, negative, and zero values, as well as floating-point numbers. The function's simplicity and lack of error checking for non-numeric inputs imply that it assumes `a` and `b` will always be numbers, which is a valid assumption given the problem description.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)` and `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, demonstrate the function's correctness for specific cases. The function's general implementation, `return (b, a)`, ensures that it works correctly for all valid input combinations.

Since the code correctly implements the required functionality and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the program is considered correct.
