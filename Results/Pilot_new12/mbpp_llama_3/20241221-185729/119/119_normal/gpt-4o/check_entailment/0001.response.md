Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple where the second number `b` is followed by the first number `a`. The function accurately implements this behavior with the line `return (b, a)`. This simple swap operation does not contain any conditional logic or loops, making it straightforward to analyze.

Given the problem description, the function correctly meets the requirements. For any pair of numbers `a` and `b`, the function will return a tuple `(b, a)`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. This applies to all possible numeric inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and non-integer values, as long as they are numbers.

The test cases provided (`func_1(10, 20)`, `func_1(15, 17)`, and `func_1(100, 200)`) demonstrate its correctness for positive integers, but the function's simplicity and lack of conditional logic mean it does not have any apparent edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. It will work correctly for all numeric inputs.

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the code provided, the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described.
