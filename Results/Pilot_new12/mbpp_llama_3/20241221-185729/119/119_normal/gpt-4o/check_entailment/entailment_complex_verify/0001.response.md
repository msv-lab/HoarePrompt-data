Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the program is correct.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The provided code defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that does exactly that, returning a tuple `(b, a)`. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function accurately implements this behavior, and the annotated version of the code supports this conclusion.

The annotated version of the code clearly states that "The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and returns a tuple containing the two numbers in reverse order, `b` followed by `a`." This description matches the problem description, and the code itself implements this behavior correctly.

The annotated version also mentions that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs. However, this is not a problem, as we are assuming that the input to the program will be valid and will not cause any errors.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct. The reason for this is that the code accurately implements the behavior described in the problem description, and the annotated version of the code supports this conclusion.

Final: **True**
