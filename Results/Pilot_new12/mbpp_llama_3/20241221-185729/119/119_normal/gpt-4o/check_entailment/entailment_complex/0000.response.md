The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Correctness: **True**

The reason why the program is correct is that it directly meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It accepts two numbers as input, reverses their order, and returns them as a tuple. The function does not have any condition or logic that would cause it to deviate from this behavior, and the unit tests (`assert` statements) provided also validate this correctness for various input combinations. 

Additionally, since we assume the input will always be valid, the lack of error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs does not affect the correctness of the program in relation to the problem description.
