Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Understanding Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime Numbers**: Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, starting with 7.

2. **Function 1: Prime Number Check (`func_1`)**: This function checks if a given number `n` is prime. It first checks if `n` is less than 2 and returns `False` immediately if so. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) to check for any divisors. If `n` has any divisors in this range, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.

3. **Function 2: Finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime (`func_2`)**: This function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts by checking if `n` is 1 and returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, if true. For `n > 1`, it initializes a counter `count` to 1 and a number `num` to 7. It then enters a loop where it increments `num` by 1 in each iteration and checks if `num` is prime using `func_1`. If `num` is prime and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, it increments the `count`. When `count` equals `n`, it returns `num`, which is the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

4. **Correctness of the Program**: The program correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as described in the problem description. It accurately checks for prime numbers and filters them based on the condition of being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The loop ensures that it checks an infinite sequence of numbers until it finds the nth prime number that meets the specified conditions.

In conclusion, the given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly identifies and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, making it a correct implementation based on the provided problem description and assuming valid inputs as stated.
