You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct. It consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime, which is a necessary condition for a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The `func_2` function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. In other words, it is a prime number that leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

The `func_2` function starts with the number 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It then increments the number and checks if it is prime using the `func_1` function. If the number is prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, it increments a counter. When the counter reaches the specified value `n`, the function returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The program correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For larger values of `n`, the program uses a while loop to iterate through numbers greater than 7, checking if they are prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. If such a number is found, the counter is incremented. The loop continues until the counter reaches `n`, at which point the function returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

After examining the code, I did not find any cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program seems to correctly check for primality and the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime condition, and it handles the special case where `n` is 1. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is exhausted, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The return value is determined by the `n`th occurrence of a number satisfying both conditions, not by specific values like 7, 8, or 9 as mentioned in the overall description. The state of the program after conclusion is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, or it enters an infinite loop if such a number cannot be found.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
