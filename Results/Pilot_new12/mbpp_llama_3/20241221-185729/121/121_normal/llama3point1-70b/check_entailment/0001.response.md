Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The first function, `func_1(n)`, checks if a number `n` is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of `n`. This is an efficient and correct approach for prime checking.

2. The second function, `func_2(n)`, uses `func_1(n)` to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are defined as primes of the form 6k ± 1 (with k > 0). The function starts with the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, 7, and then increments a counter each time it encounters a prime of the form 6k ± 1. Once the counter reaches `n`, it returns the corresponding prime number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- For `n = 1`, it correctly returns the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, 7.
- For `n > 1`, it correctly checks each number to see if it's prime and of the form 6k ± 1, incrementing the counter and returning the nth such prime.
- The program also correctly handles the edge case where `n` is not a positive integer, as `func_1(n)` will return `False` for non-prime inputs, and `func_2(n)` will not attempt to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for non-positive `n`.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
