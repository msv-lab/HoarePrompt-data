Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines two functions: `func_1` checks if a given number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

`func_2` fulfills this requirement by first checking if the input `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number). For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. 

The code handles all potential cases for positive integer inputs `n`. It correctly identifies the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number (7) and then iterates through subsequent numbers to find the nth such prime, using the prime-checking function `func_1` to ensure that only prime numbers are considered.

The annotations provided with the code help to clarify its operation and do not indicate any missing logic or edge cases that the code does not handle, given the assumption that the input will be a valid positive integer. 

Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness can be confirmed.
