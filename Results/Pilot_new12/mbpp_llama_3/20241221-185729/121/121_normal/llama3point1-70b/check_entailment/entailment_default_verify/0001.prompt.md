You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The first function, `func_1(n)`, checks if a number `n` is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of `n`. This is an efficient and correct approach for prime checking.

2. The second function, `func_2(n)`, uses `func_1(n)` to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are defined as primes of the form 6k ± 1 (with k > 0). The function starts with the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, 7, and then increments a counter each time it encounters a prime of the form 6k ± 1. Once the counter reaches `n`, it returns the corresponding prime number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- For `n = 1`, it correctly returns the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, 7.
- For `n > 1`, it correctly checks each number to see if it's prime and of the form 6k ± 1, incrementing the counter and returning the nth such prime.
- The program also correctly handles the edge case where `n` is not a positive integer, as `func_1(n)` will return `False` for non-prime inputs, and `func_2(n)` will not attempt to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for non-positive `n`.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is exhausted, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The return value is determined by the `n`th occurrence of a number satisfying both conditions, not by specific values like 7, 8, or 9 as mentioned in the overall description. The state of the program after conclusion is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, or it enters an infinite loop if such a number cannot be found.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
