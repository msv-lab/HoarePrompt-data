Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints. The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and the function `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The function `func_2` correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6, which are the properties of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. 

The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid. Therefore, we can conclude that the code does what the problem description says for every potential case.

It's also important to note that the function `func_2` does not enter an infinite loop because the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is infinite, and the function will always find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number given a positive integer `n`. 

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of how the functions work, but do not indicate any cases where the code does not work as expected. Therefore, we can conclude that the code is correct.
