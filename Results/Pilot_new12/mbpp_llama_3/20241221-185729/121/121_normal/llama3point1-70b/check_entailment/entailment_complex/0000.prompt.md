You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `n` (inclusive), and either the function has returned False (indicating `n` is divisible by some `i` in the range) or the loop has completed without returning False (indicating `n` is not divisible by any `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `n`).
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number. It accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., greater than 1 and not divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`) and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 (returning `False`) and cases where `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (returning `False`). If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The state of the program after execution is that it has determined whether the input number `n` is prime or not, with `True` indicating primality and `False` indicating non-primality, covering all potential cases for integer inputs `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, and `n` is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` remains the same as its original value, `count` is equal to the original value of `n`, `num` is the value for which `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, and `count` equals the original value of `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is exhausted, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The return value is determined by the `n`th occurrence of a number satisfying both conditions, not by specific values like 7, 8, or 9 as mentioned in the overall description. The state of the program after conclusion is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, or it enters an infinite loop if such a number cannot be found.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
