Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

`func_1` correctly checks for primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. It handles edge cases where the input number is less than 2 and returns False in such cases, as well as correctly identifying prime numbers as True.

`func_2` uses `func_1` to check for primality and then checks if the prime number leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6 to identify Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. It starts counting from 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter each time it finds such a number, returning the number when the counter equals `n`. 

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, `func_2` correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for every potential case where `n` is a positive integer. It handles the base case where `n` is 1 and returns 7, and it iterates through numbers to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for `n` greater than 1.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of how the functions work. There are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected in the description, and all examples should work correctly. 

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the output hints, the program is correct for every potential case, assuming valid input.
