You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number. It accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., greater than 1 and not divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`) and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 (returning `False`) and cases where `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (returning `False`). If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The state of the program after execution is that it has determined whether the input number `n` is prime or not, with `True` indicating primality and `False` indicating non-primality, covering all potential cases for integer inputs `n`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is exhausted, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The return value is determined by the `n`th occurrence of a number satisfying both conditions, not by specific values like 7, 8, or 9 as mentioned in the overall description. The state of the program after conclusion is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, or it enters an infinite loop if such a number cannot be found.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
