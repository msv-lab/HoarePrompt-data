Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct. It consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime, which is a necessary condition for a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The `func_2` function finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. In other words, it is a prime number that leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

The `func_2` function starts with the number 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It then increments the number and checks if it is prime using the `func_1` function. If the number is prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, it increments a counter. When the counter reaches the specified value `n`, the function returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The program correctly handles the special case where `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For larger values of `n`, the program uses a while loop to iterate through numbers greater than 7, checking if they are prime and congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. If such a number is found, the counter is incremented. The loop continues until the counter reaches `n`, at which point the function returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

After examining the code, I did not find any cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program seems to correctly check for primality and the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime condition, and it handles the special case where `n` is 1. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
