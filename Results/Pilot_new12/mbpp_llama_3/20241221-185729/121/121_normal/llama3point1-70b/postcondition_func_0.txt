The function `func_1` checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number. It accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., greater than 1 and not divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`) and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 (returning `False`) and cases where `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (returning `False`). If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The state of the program after execution is that it has determined whether the input number `n` is prime or not, with `True` indicating primality and `False` indicating non-primality, covering all potential cases for integer inputs `n`.
