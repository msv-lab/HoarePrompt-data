To determine the output state, we need to consider the effects of the code `num += 1` on the variables and their conditions.

1. **Initial State of `num`**: `num` is 7.
2. **Effect of `num += 1`**: This operation increments `num` by 1, so `num` becomes 8.
3. **Condition based on the remainder of `num` divided by 6**:
   - Initially, with `num = 7`, the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 1. This means `count` is 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`.
   - After incrementing `num` to 8, the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 2. This does not satisfy the condition for `count` to be 2 (which requires the remainder to be 1 or 5), so the state of `count` reverts to its default condition, which is `count` is 1, given that the specific condition for `count` to be 2 is no longer met.

4. **State of `n`**: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1. The operation `num += 1` does not affect `n`, so `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Condition `func_1(num)`**: The increment of `num` might affect whether `num` satisfies `func_1(num)`, but without the definition of `func_1`, we can only state that `num` is now 8 and previously satisfied this condition when `num` was 7.

Given these considerations, the output state is:

- `n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1.
- `num` is 8.
- Since the remainder of `num` (8) divided by 6 is 2, which does not meet the condition for `count` to be 2, `count` is 1.
- `num` previously satisfied the condition `func_1(num)` when `num` was 7, but the current satisfaction of `func_1(num)` with `num` being 8 is not specified due to lack of information about `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `num` is 8, `count` is 1**
