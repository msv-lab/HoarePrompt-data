To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the given code and the output states after a few iterations. The loop will continue to execute until it finds a `num` for which `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, and `count` equals `n`.

The loop increments `num` by 1 in each iteration and increments `count` by 1 if `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`. The loop returns `num` when `count` equals `n`.

Based on the given output states, we can see that `num` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `count` is updated only when `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`.

Since the loop will continue to execute until `count` equals `n`, the final value of `count` will be equal to `n`. The final value of `num` will be the value for which `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, and `count` equals `n`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not updated in the loop.

Output State: **`n` remains the same as its original value, `count` is equal to the original value of `n`, `num` is the value for which `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, and `count` equals the original value of `n`**
