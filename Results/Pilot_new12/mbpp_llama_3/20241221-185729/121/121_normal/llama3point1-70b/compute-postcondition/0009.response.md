The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `num` is still 7, and it still satisfies the condition `func_1(num)`. The remainder of `num` divided by 6 is still either 1 or 5, which in this case is 1, since 7 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, the current value of `num` is 7, the current value of `num` satisfies the condition `func_1(num)`, and the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, `num` satisfies the condition `func_1(num)`, and the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 1**
