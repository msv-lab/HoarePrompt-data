According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Since there are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7**
