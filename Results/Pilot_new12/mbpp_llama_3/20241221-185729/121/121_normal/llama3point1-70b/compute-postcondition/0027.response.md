Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `num` is 9. If `num` % 6 is in [1, 5], then `count` is 2 or 3. If `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9. Otherwise, `count` remains 1 or 2 if `num` % 6 is not in [1, 5], or no changes are made to `count` if `num` % 6 is in [1, 5] but `count` does not equal `n`.***
