The current value of `n` is equal to `count`, and `count` is 2, so `n` is 2. `num` is 7, which satisfies the condition `func_1(num)`, and the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 1.

Output State: **The program returns 7, which is the value of 'num', 'num' satisfies the condition func_1(num) and has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6**
