To solve this problem, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `num` is 8.
- `count` is initially 1.
- If `func_1(num)` is true, and if `num` % 6 is in [1, 5], `count` is updated to 2.
- If `count` equals `n` after the update, the program returns `num` which is 8.

Given Code:
```python
num += 1
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. **Update of `num`**: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. So, `num` becomes 9.

2. **Impact on `func_1(num)` Condition**: The condition `func_1(num)`'s truth value is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we cannot directly infer its impact after `num` is updated to 9. However, since the direct outcome of `func_1(num)` is not specified, we proceed with the information we have.

3. **Update of `count`**: The initial state mentions that if `num` % 6 is in [1, 5], `count` is updated to 2, given `func_1(num)` is true. Initially, `num` was 8, which does not satisfy `num` % 6 being in [1, 5] because 8 % 6 = 2. After incrementing `num` to 9, we have `num` % 6 = 3, which satisfies the condition of being in [1, 5] if `func_1(num)` is true. Therefore, if `func_1(9)` is true, `count` would be updated to 2.

4. **Return Condition**: The condition to return `num` (which is now 9) is if `count` equals `n` after the update. Since we don't have the exact value of `n` but know it's a positive integer not equal to 1, and considering `count` could be updated to 2 under the conditions described, the return condition's evaluation depends on the value of `n`. If `n` were 2, then after updating `count` to 2 (if `func_1(9)` is true), the program would return `num`, which is 9.

Given these considerations, the output state reflects the changes in `num` and the potential update of `count` based on the conditions provided. However, without explicit values for `n` and the truth value of `func_1(num)` after `num` is incremented, we can only describe the potential updates based on the conditions given.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `num` is 9, `count` is 1 or potentially updated to 2 if `func_1(9)` is true and 9 % 6 is in [1, 5], which it is; if `count` equals `n` after any update and `func_1(9)` is true, `num` (which is 9) would be returned.**
