To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `num` is 9.
- If `num` % 6 is in [1, 5], then if `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9, otherwise `count` is 2 or 3.
- If `num` % 6 is not in [1, 5], `count` remains 1 or 2.

Given `num` is 9, `num` % 6 equals 3, which is in [1, 5]. Thus, the condition "if `num` % 6 is in [1, 5]" is true.

The code `num += 1` increments `num` by 1, making `num` equal to 10.

Now, `num` % 6 equals 4, which is not in [1, 5]. This changes the condition to "if `num` % 6 is not in [1, 5]".

Since `num` has changed, we need to consider how this change affects the conditions related to `count`. However, the value of `count` itself is not directly modified by the code snippet provided.

Given the new value of `num` (10), the conditions related to `num` % 6 not being in [1, 5] apply, meaning `count` remains 1 or 2, as per the initial state conditions when `num` % 6 is not in [1, 5].

The output state, therefore, is:
- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `num` is 10.
- Since `num` % 6 is not in [1, 5] after the increment, `count` remains 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `num` is 10, and `count` is 1 or 2.**
