To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the current program state.

The `while` loop statement is `while True:`, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement or an exception that stops its execution. Since the condition is always `True`, the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

Given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `n` is not equal to 1,
- `num` is 8,
- `count` is 1,

No adjustments are needed to the state because the loop condition is `while True`, meaning it does not depend on the values of `n`, `num`, or `count` to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `num` is 8, `count` is 1**
