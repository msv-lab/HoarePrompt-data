To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition.

Given state:
- `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.
- `num` is 9.
- `count` is 1 or potentially updated to 2 if `func_1(9)` is true and 9 % 6 is in [1, 5], which it is.

The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement or an error that stops its execution.

Since the loop condition is always true (`while True`), the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state of `n`, `num`, and `count`. There are no conditions in the loop statement itself that need to be met for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 1, `num` is 9, `count` is 1 or 2**
