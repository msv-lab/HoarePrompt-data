Functionality: **The function `func_2(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is exhausted, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The return value is determined by the `n`th occurrence of a number satisfying both conditions, not by specific values like 7, 8, or 9 as mentioned in the overall description. The state of the program after conclusion is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, or it enters an infinite loop if such a number cannot be found.**
