Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `num` is 7, `num` satisfies the condition `func_1(num)`. If the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 1 or 5, then `count` is 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. If the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is not 1 or 5, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code to handle this condition.***
