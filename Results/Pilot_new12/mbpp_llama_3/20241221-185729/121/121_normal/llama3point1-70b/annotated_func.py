    #The program returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given integer `n` is a prime number. It accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., greater than 1 and not divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`) and `False` otherwise. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 2 (returning `False`) and cases where `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n` (returning `False`). If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The state of the program after execution is that it has determined whether the input number `n` is prime or not, with `True` indicating primality and `False` indicating non-primality, covering all potential cases for integer inputs `n`.

                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` remains the same as its original value, `count` is equal to the original value of `n`, `num` is the value for which `func_1(num)` is true and `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, and `count` equals the original value of `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(n)` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7, checking if the number is a prime (using the `func_1(num)` function) and if it leaves a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6. It increments a counter for each such number found and returns the number when the counter equals `n`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers is exhausted, potentially leading to an infinite loop. The return value is determined by the `n`th occurrence of a number satisfying both conditions, not by specific values like 7, 8, or 9 as mentioned in the overall description. The state of the program after conclusion is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, or it enters an infinite loop if such a number cannot be found.
