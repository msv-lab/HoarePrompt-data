#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is neither 0 nor 1, which implies that n is at least 2
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is the second to last term in the sequence generated by the loop, `S1` is the last term in the sequence generated by the loop, `i` is `n`.
    return S1
    #The program returns S1, which is the last term in the sequence generated by the loop, where the sequence generation depends on the loop that iterates at least twice since `n` is at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the last term `S1` of a sequence generated based on `n` if `n` is at least 2. The sequence is generated iteratively, with each term depending on the previous two terms, starting with initial terms `S0` and `S1` both set to 1. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by immediately returning 1, and for `n` greater than 1, it generates the sequence up to the `n`-th term and returns the last term `S1`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a non-negative integer.
