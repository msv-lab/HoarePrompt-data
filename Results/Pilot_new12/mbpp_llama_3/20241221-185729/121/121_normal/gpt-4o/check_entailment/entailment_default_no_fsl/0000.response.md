Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description says. The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the provided code does not generate prime numbers, let alone Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

The code appears to be generating a sequence of numbers using a recursive formula similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different recurrence relation (S_next = 2 * S1 + S0). The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and the provided code does not check for primality or generate this specific sequence.

For example, the function `func_1(3)` returns 7, which is a prime number, but it is not clear if this is a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime without further context. However, `func_1(4)` returns 17, which is a prime number, but again, it is not clear if this is the correct Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. 

A correct implementation of the function would need to generate prime numbers and specifically identify the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The provided code does not meet this requirement, so it is incorrect.
