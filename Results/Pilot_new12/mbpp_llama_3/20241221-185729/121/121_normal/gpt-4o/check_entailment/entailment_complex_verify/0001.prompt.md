You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the function `func_1` does not actually check for primality, it appears to be generating a sequence of numbers based on a recursive formula, but the provided unit tests and the function implementation do not match the problem description.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when `n` is a negative number or a non-integer, the function does not handle these cases and will either produce incorrect results or throw an error. Additionally, the function does not actually check if the generated number is prime, which is a requirement for the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. 

Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that are defined by a specific recursive formula but with a condition that each generated number should be prime. In this implementation, that condition is not checked. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to modify the function to generate the sequence and then check each number for primality. If the generated number is not prime, it should not be counted in the sequence. 

For example, if we call `func_1(2)`, it returns `3` which is indeed a prime number and it should return the 2nd prime number in the sequence if it is a prime, but in the sequence generated by the given formula, it will return the second number in the sequence regardless of whether it is prime or not. 

So, this program does not work correctly for all possible cases. 

To fix this issue, we should implement a function to check for primality and use it in the `func_1` function. 

Here's a simple example of how we can do this:
```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    i = 2
    while True:
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
        if is_prime(S1):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return S1
        i += 1
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is neither 0 nor 1, which implies that n is at least 2
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is the second to last term in the sequence generated by the loop, `S1` is the last term in the sequence generated by the loop, `i` is `n`.
    return S1
    #The program returns S1, which is the last term in the sequence generated by the loop, where the sequence generation depends on the loop that iterates at least twice since `n` is at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the last term `S1` of a sequence generated based on `n` if `n` is at least 2. The sequence is generated iteratively, with each term depending on the previous two terms, starting with initial terms `S0` and `S1` both set to 1. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by immediately returning 1, and for `n` greater than 1, it generates the sequence up to the `n`-th term and returns the last term `S1`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a non-negative integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
