Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not actually calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers where each term is obtained by adding or subtracting one from the previous term to get the next prime number. However, the given code seems to be calculating a different sequence, specifically a sequence defined by the recurrence relation S_n = 2 * S_(n-1) + S_(n-2), starting with S_0 = 1 and S_1 = 1.

The provided code does not appear to be related to prime numbers at all. It is simply implementing a recursive sequence formula. For example, when given the input 2, the function returns 3, but 3 is indeed a prime number and a part of the sequence generated by this formula. However, the 4th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is actually 29, which is not returned by this function when called with n = 4. Instead, the function returns 17, which is indeed a prime but does not align with the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Specifically, the code doesn't account for checking if each generated number is prime, nor does it follow the specific pattern of adding or subtracting one to move to the next prime in the sequence as the problem description would suggest. 

To actually calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, you would need a function that checks for primality and follows the specific sequence generation rules defined by Newman, Shanks, and Williams, which this code does not do. 

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly implement the function as described in the problem statement.
