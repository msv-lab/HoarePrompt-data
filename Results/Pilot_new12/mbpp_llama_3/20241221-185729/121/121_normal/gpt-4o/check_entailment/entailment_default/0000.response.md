Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not appear to be related to finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Instead, it seems to be generating a sequence of numbers based on a recursive formula. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is a specific type of prime number that satisfies a certain condition, but the given code does not seem to be checking for this condition.

The code provided generates a sequence where each term is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`, which is not related to the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The function also returns 1 for n = 0 or n = 1, which does not align with the expected output for these inputs.

Additionally, the unit tests provided do not seem to be related to Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers either. For example, `func_1(3)` is expected to return 7, but without more context, it's unclear why this should be the case.

A correct implementation of a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number would require a different approach, such as checking numbers to see if they meet the conditions for being a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, and then returning the nth such number found. The provided code does not seem to be doing this.
