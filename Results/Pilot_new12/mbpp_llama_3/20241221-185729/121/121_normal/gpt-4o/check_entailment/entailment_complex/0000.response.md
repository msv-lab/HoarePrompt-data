Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but the provided program does not generate prime numbers. Instead, it generates a sequence of numbers based on a recursive formula and returns the nth term of the sequence. The sequence generated by the program appears to be a known sequence (e.g., the Pell numbers), but it does not produce prime numbers.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and the program should be generating and checking prime numbers to find the nth term in this sequence. However, the provided program does not contain any primality checks or prime number generation, and therefore it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

A correct implementation would involve generating prime numbers and checking whether they are Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, not simply generating a sequence of numbers based on a recursive formula.
