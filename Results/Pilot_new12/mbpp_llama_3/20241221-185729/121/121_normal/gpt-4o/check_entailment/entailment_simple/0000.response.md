Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but the provided program does not generate Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. 

Instead, the program generates a sequence of numbers using a recursive formula: `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which appears to be a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a different recurrence relation. The program then returns the nth term of this sequence.

Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and there is no indication in the provided program that it checks for primality or generates these specific prime numbers.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is considered incorrect.
