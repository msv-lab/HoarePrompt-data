Correctness: **False**

The given program is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the function `func_1` does not actually check for primality, it appears to be generating a sequence of numbers based on a recursive formula, but the provided unit tests and the function implementation do not match the problem description.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when `n` is a negative number or a non-integer, the function does not handle these cases and will either produce incorrect results or throw an error. Additionally, the function does not actually check if the generated number is prime, which is a requirement for the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. 

Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that are defined by a specific recursive formula but with a condition that each generated number should be prime. In this implementation, that condition is not checked. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to modify the function to generate the sequence and then check each number for primality. If the generated number is not prime, it should not be counted in the sequence. 

For example, if we call `func_1(2)`, it returns `3` which is indeed a prime number and it should return the 2nd prime number in the sequence if it is a prime, but in the sequence generated by the given formula, it will return the second number in the sequence regardless of whether it is prime or not. 

So, this program does not work correctly for all possible cases. 

To fix this issue, we should implement a function to check for primality and use it in the `func_1` function. 

Here's a simple example of how we can do this:
```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    i = 2
    while True:
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
        if is_prime(S1):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return S1
        i += 1
```
