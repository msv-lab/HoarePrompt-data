The values of `S0` and `S1` are updated. `S0` becomes the value of `S1`, which is 7, and `S1` becomes the value of `S_next`, which is 17. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
