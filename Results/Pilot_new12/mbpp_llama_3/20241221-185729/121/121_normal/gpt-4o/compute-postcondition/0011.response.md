To calculate the result, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The given code is `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. 

From the initial state, we know that `S0` is 3 and `S1` is 7. 

So, `S_next` is calculated as `2 * 7 + 3`, which equals `14 + 3`, resulting in `S_next` being `17`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` remains 3, `S1` remains 7, and `i` remains 4.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
