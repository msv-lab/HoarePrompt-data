According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer and at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being at least 2 ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is introduced in the loop and will take values starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive). The initial values of `S0` and `S1` are given but are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, which depends solely on `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2**
