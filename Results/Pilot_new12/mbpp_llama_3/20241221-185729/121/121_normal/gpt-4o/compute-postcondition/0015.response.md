The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function has two possible return cases. 
Case_1: The function returns 1. 
Case_2: The function returns S1, which is the last term in a generated sequence. 
The sequence generation is dependent on a loop that iterates at least twice, given that `n` is at least 2. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 1 or the last term S1 of a sequence generated based on `n`, where the choice between these returns depends on conditions not specified in the parameter constraints but implied in the output cases.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns either 1 or the last term S1 of a sequence generated based on n.**
