The given Python code calculates `S_next` based on the values of `S0` and `S1`. Given that `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 1, we can substitute these values into the equation.

`S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`
`S_next = 2 * 1 + 1`
`S_next = 2 + 1`
`S_next = 3`

The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
