The code snippet swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. So, the new value of `S0` becomes the old value of `S1` which is 1, and the new value of `S1` becomes the old value of `S_next` which is 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
