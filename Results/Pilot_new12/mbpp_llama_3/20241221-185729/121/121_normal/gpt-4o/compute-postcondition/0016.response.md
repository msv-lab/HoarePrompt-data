Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the last term `S1` of a sequence generated based on `n` if `n` is at least 2. The sequence is generated iteratively, with each term depending on the previous two terms, starting with initial terms `S0` and `S1` both set to 1. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by immediately returning 1, and for `n` greater than 1, it generates the sequence up to the `n`-th term and returns the last term `S1`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a non-negative integer.**
