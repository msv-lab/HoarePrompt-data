The code `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` updates the value of `S_next`. Given the initial state, `S1` is 3 and `S0` is 1. Therefore, `S_next` becomes `2 * 3 + 1`, which equals `7`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
