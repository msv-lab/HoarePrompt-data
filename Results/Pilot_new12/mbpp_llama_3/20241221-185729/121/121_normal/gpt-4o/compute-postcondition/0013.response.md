To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we can analyze the pattern in the output states provided for the first few iterations and understand how the loop code updates the variables.

The loop code calculates `S_next` as `2 * S1 + S0` and then updates `S0` and `S1` to the previous `S1` and the newly calculated `S_next`, respectively. This pattern suggests a recursive relation where each new term (`S_next`) is calculated based on the two preceding terms (`S0` and `S1`).

Given that:
- Initially, `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 1.
- After 1 iteration, `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 3.
- After 2 iterations, `S0` is 3 and `S1` is 7.
- After 3 iterations, `S0` is 7 and `S1` is 17.

This sequence resembles a known sequence where each term is calculated as `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`. This is indicative of a specific kind of recursive sequence.

However, to directly answer the question without diverting into sequence identification, we should focus on the provided code and the pattern it establishes:

1. `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, indicating the loop will run from `i = 2` to `n`.
2. `S0` and `S1` are initialized to 1, representing the first two terms of the sequence.
3. The loop calculates each subsequent term as `2 * S1 + S0` and updates `S0` and `S1` accordingly.

For the loop to execute `n-1` times (since it starts from 2 and goes to `n`), `n` must be at least 2. After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n` (since the loop iterates from 2 to `n` inclusive), and `S0` and `S1` will hold the last two calculated terms of the sequence.

Given the recursive nature and the specific calculations, without a straightforward formula provided in the problem statement for the nth term, we observe the pattern where `S1` after each iteration becomes the new term in the sequence, and `S0` is the term before that.

Therefore, after all iterations have finished, the state will reflect the final values of `S0` and `S1` as the last two terms calculated by the loop, with `i` being equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is the second to last term in the sequence generated by the loop, `S1` is the last term in the sequence generated by the loop, `i` is `n`.**
