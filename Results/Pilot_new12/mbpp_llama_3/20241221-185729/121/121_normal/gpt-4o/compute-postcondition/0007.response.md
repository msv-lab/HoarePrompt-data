According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, but since `n` is at least 2 and we need `n` to be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
