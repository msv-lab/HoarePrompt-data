According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
