The code assigns the maximum value in the list `arr` to the variable `max_val`. The value of `min_val` remains the smallest integer in `arr`, which is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`**
