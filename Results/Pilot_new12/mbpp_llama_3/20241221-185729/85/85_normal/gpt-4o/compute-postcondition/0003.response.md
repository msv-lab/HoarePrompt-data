To find the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and the given Python code snippet. 

The initial state is: 
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`.
- `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`.
- `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.

Given the Python code snippet:
```python
return max_diff
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:
- The code returns `max_diff`, which is calculated as `max_val - min_val`.
- Since `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr` and `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, `max_diff` represents the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.**
