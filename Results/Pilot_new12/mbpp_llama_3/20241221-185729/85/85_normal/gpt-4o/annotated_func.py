#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The function operates on the assumption that the input list contains at least two elements, which is not explicitly validated in the code. If the input list contains only one element, the function will still return 0 (since the difference between an element and itself is 0), but if the input list is empty, the function will throw an error when trying to find the minimum or maximum value. After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the program state reflects the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the original list, or an error state if the input list was empty.
