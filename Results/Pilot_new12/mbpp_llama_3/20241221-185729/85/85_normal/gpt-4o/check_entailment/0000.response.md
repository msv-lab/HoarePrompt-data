Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works because the difference between any two elements cannot be greater than the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Here's why this approach works:

1. Finding the minimum and maximum values in the array: `min_val = min(arr)` and `max_val = max(arr)`.
2. Calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values: `max_diff = max_val - min_val`.
3. Returning the calculated difference: `return max_diff`.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Arrays with positive and negative numbers.
- Arrays with duplicate numbers.
- Arrays with a single element (in which case the function returns 0, because there are no two elements to find the difference between).
- Empty arrays are not handled, but based on the provided unit tests, it seems that the function is expected to work with non-empty arrays.

Since the function correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array for all potential cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
