Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by finding the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the array, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value (`max_diff = max_val - min_val`). This approach ensures that the maximum difference is found, as the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array will always be the greatest.

The function operates under the assumption that the input list contains at least one element, and it handles the case where the list contains only one element by returning 0, which is correct since the difference between an element and itself is 0.

The output hints suggest that the function does not validate if the input list contains at least two elements, and it will throw an error if the input list is empty. However, the problem statement does not specify what the function should do in case of an empty input list, and it is commonly assumed that the input will be valid.

Given the provided unit tests and the assumption that the input will be a non-empty list of integers, the function works as expected and does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly.

Note that the function assumes that the input is a valid list of integers. If the input is not a list, or if the list contains non-integer values, the function may not work as expected. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid.
