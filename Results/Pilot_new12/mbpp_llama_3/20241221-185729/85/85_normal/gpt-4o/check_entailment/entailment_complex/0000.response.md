Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct according to the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the smallest and largest elements in the input array, respectively. This ensures that the maximum difference between any two elements is found.

2. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

3. The program returns this difference, fulfilling the requirement specified in the problem description.

Given that the input array will always have at least two elements, as specified in the problem description and annotations, the function will always return the correct maximum difference.

To further explain, the program does not need to explicitly check every pair of elements in the array to find the maximum difference, because the difference between the maximum and minimum values will always be the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.

For example, if the input array is `[2, 1, 5, 3]`, the program correctly returns `4`, which is the maximum difference between any two elements (`5 - 1 = 4`).

In general, the program will work correctly for any input array that meets the problem's requirements, i.e., a non-empty array with at least two elements.
