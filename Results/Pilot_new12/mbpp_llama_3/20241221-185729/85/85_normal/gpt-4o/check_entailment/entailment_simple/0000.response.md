Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program achieves this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program finds the minimum value in the array using the built-in `min()` function and assigns it to `min_val`. This ensures that the smallest number in the array is found.

2. The program finds the maximum value in the array using the built-in `max()` function and assigns it to `max_val`. This ensures that the largest number in the array is found.

3. The program calculates the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` and assigns it to `max_diff`. This difference represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, because the difference between the largest and smallest numbers will always be the maximum possible difference.

4. The program returns `max_diff`, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Since the program correctly finds and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The provided unit tests also confirm this, as the program returns the expected results for the given test cases. 

The program does not consider cases where there are multiple pairs of elements with the same maximum difference (for example, an array with multiple identical maximum or minimum values), but this is because the problem description only asks for the maximum difference, not the pairs of elements that produce this difference. Therefore, the program is still correct even in these cases.
