Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(arr)` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the smallest element from the largest element. This straightforward approach aligns perfectly with the problem description.

The output hints mention that the function handles lists with at least two elements and treats the input list as read-only without modifying it. They also acknowledge that the function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, but since we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., a list with at least two elements), this does not affect the correctness of the function in the context of the problem description.

The provided function is correct because it accurately computes the range of values (the difference between the maximum and minimum values) in the input list, which indeed represents the maximum difference between any two elements. Given that we are assuming valid input (a list with at least two elements), every potential case within this constraint is handled correctly by the function. Therefore, the function meets the requirements as outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs.
