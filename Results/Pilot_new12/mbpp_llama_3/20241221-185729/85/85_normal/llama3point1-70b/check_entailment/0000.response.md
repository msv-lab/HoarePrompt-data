Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It correctly uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively, and then subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value to calculate the maximum difference.

This approach works correctly for all possible input arrays, including empty arrays (which would raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the minimum or maximum value, indicating that the function needs a non-empty array to operate), arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with negative numbers.

For example, if we have an array `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function correctly returns `8` as the maximum difference between any two elements (`9 - 1 = 8`). Similarly, for an array `[-5, 0, 5]`, the function correctly returns `10` as the maximum difference between any two elements (`5 - (-5) = 10`).

The function is concise, efficient, and handles all edge cases correctly, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
