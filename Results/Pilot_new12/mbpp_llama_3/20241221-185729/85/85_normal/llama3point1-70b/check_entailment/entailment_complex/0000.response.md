Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, which is equivalent to finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. 

The provided function `func_1` does exactly this: it returns the difference between the largest (`max(arr)`) and smallest (`min(arr)`) integers in the list `arr`. This approach ensures that the function always finds the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, because the difference between the maximum and minimum values is always the largest possible difference.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 5, 3, 9, 2]`, the function will return `9 - 1 = 8`, which is indeed the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Since we assume that the input will always be a list of integers with at least two elements, the function will always work correctly and return the expected result. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
