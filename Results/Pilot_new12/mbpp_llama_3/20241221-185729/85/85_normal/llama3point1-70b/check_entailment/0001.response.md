Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array, respectively, and then subtracts the minimum from the maximum to find the maximum difference.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be between the maximum and minimum elements. By subtracting the minimum from the maximum, the function effectively finds the largest possible difference between any two elements in the array.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty arrays: Although not explicitly handled, the `max` and `min` functions will raise a `ValueError` when given an empty array, which is a reasonable behavior.
* Arrays with a single element: The function will return 0, which is the correct maximum difference for an array with only one element.
* Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will still find the maximum and minimum elements correctly, even if there are duplicates.
* Arrays with negative numbers: The function will handle negative numbers correctly, as the `max` and `min` functions can handle negative values.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
