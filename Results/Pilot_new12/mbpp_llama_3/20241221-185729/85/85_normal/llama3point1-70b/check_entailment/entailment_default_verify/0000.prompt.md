You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It correctly uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively, and then subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value to calculate the maximum difference.

This approach works correctly for all possible input arrays, including empty arrays (which would raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the minimum or maximum value, indicating that the function needs a non-empty array to operate), arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with negative numbers.

For example, if we have an array `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function correctly returns `8` as the maximum difference between any two elements (`9 - 1 = 8`). Similarly, for an array `[-5, 0, 5]`, the function correctly returns `10` as the maximum difference between any two elements (`5 - (-5) = 10`).

The function is concise, efficient, and handles all edge cases correctly, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. It handles lists with at least two elements, and its return value will be the range of values in the input list, effectively measuring the spread of numbers. The function does not modify the input list, treating it as read-only, and does not handle potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, which would result in an error when attempting to find the minimum or maximum value. For valid input, the function provides a simple metric that can be used for further analysis or processing, without altering the original data.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
