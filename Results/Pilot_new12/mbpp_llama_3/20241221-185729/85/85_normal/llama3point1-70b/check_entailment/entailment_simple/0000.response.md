To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

The provided function, `func_1`, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array using the built-in `max` and `min` functions. 

Since the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always occur between the largest and smallest elements, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- It correctly identifies the maximum element in the array using `max(arr)`.
- It correctly identifies the minimum element in the array using `min(arr)`.
- The difference between these two values, `max(arr) - min(arr)`, gives the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.

Therefore, given that the input is valid (i.e., `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements), the function `func_1` does indeed find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array.

Correctness: **True**
