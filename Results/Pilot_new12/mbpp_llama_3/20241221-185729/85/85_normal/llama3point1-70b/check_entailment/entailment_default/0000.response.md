Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and efficient solution to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python to find the largest and smallest integers in the list, respectively, and then returns their difference. 

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this code effectively addresses the problem description for every potential valid case. The output hints agree with the code and indicate that it handles lists with at least two elements, which is in line with the assumption of valid input. 

The function does not need to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element because, under the problem's assumptions, these cases are considered invalid inputs. Therefore, the code does what the problem description says for every potential valid case.
