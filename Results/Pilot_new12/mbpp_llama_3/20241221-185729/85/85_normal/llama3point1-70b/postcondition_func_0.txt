The function accepts a list of integers and returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. It handles lists with at least two elements, and its return value will be the range of values in the input list, effectively measuring the spread of numbers. The function does not modify the input list, treating it as read-only, and does not handle potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, which would result in an error when attempting to find the minimum or maximum value. For valid input, the function provides a simple metric that can be used for further analysis or processing, without altering the original data.
