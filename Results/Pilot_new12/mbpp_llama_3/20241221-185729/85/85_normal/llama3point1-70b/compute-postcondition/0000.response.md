The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `max(arr)` will return the largest integer in the list and `min(arr)` will return the smallest integer in the list. 

Output State: **The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.**
