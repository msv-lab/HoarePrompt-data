The function checks if a given integer `n` is odd or even and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is odd (`True`) or even (`False`). It handles all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero, and will return `True` for all odd integers (e.g., -3, 1, 3) and `False` for all even integers (e.g., -2, 0, 2), covering all potential edge cases without any missing logic.
