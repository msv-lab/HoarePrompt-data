## Analysis of the Program Correctness

To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to compare its functionality with the provided problem description. The problem statement requires a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.

### Problem Description Requirements

- The function should take an integer as input.
- It should return True if the input integer is odd, indicating its parity is odd.
- It should return False if the input integer is even, indicating its parity is even.

### Program Functionality

The provided function, `func_1(n)`, takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result of the expression `n % 2!= 0`.

- For any odd integer `n`, `n % 2` will always be 1 (since odd numbers cannot be divided evenly by 2 and will leave a remainder of 1). Therefore, `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to True for all odd integers.
- For any even integer `n`, `n % 2` will always be 0 (since even numbers can be divided evenly by 2 with no remainder). Therefore, `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to False for all even integers.

### Conclusion

Given that the function correctly identifies odd numbers (returning True) and even numbers (returning False) according to the modulo operation, it aligns perfectly with the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
