The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. 

The problem description requires a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided function `func_1(n)` uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. This logic correctly identifies odd numbers, including negative and positive integers, and returns `False` for even numbers, including zero.

The function also handles all integer cases, including edge cases, without any missing logic. The use of `n % 2!= 0` as the return statement ensures that all odd integers will return `True` and all even integers will return `False`.

Therefore, since the function correctly determines whether a given number is odd or even and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is odd, and it handles all potential edge cases without any missing logic, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
