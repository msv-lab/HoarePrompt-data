Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n` divided by 2 leaves a remainder (i.e., `n % 2!= 0`), then `n` is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if `n` divided by 2 leaves no remainder (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`), then `n` is even, and the function returns `False`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function handles all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero, and will return `True` for all odd integers and `False` for all even integers. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.

There is no evidence in the annotated version of the code or the problem description that suggests the original assessment is inaccurate. The function appears to be correctly implemented and meets the requirements of the problem description.

The only potential issue that could be raised is that the function does not explicitly handle non-integer inputs, but according to the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I believe the original assessment is accurate, and the function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether a given number `n` is odd.

Final: **True**
