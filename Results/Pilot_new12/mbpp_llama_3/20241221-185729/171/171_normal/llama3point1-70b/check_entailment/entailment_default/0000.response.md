Correctness: **True**

The code provided in the function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, it means `n` is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even.

The output hints provided agree with the code, explaining that the function correctly identifies odd and even integers, covering positive, negative, and zero cases. This implies that the code handles all potential edge cases without any missing logic.

For example, if we call `func_1(3)`, the function will return `True` because 3 is odd. Similarly, `func_1(-3)` will also return `True`, and `func_1(4)` will return `False`.

Since the code accurately implements the logic to determine whether a number is odd or even, and the output hints align with this logic, we can conclude that the program does what the problem description says for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
