Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if the parity of `n` is odd (i.e., `n` is odd) and `False` otherwise. 

The line `return n % 2!= 0` uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, and `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to `True`. If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, and `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to `False`. 

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

After examining the code, I couldn't find any potential case where it doesn't work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
