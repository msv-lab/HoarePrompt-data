Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n` divided by 2 leaves a remainder (i.e., `n % 2!= 0`), then `n` is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if `n` divided by 2 leaves no remainder (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`), then `n` is even, and the function returns `False`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- For positive odd numbers (e.g., `n = 1`, `n = 3`, `n = 5`), the function returns `True`.
- For positive even numbers (e.g., `n = 2`, `n = 4`, `n = 6`), the function returns `False`.
- For negative odd numbers (e.g., `n = -1`, `n = -3`, `n = -5`), the function returns `True` because the remainder of a negative number divided by 2 can still be either 0 or 1, and this correctly handles negative odd numbers.
- For negative even numbers (e.g., `n = -2`, `n = -4`, `n = -6`), the function returns `False`.
- For zero (e.g., `n = 0`), the function returns `False`, which is correct because zero is considered an even number.

Therefore, the function `func_1(n)` accurately determines whether a given number `n` is odd, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
