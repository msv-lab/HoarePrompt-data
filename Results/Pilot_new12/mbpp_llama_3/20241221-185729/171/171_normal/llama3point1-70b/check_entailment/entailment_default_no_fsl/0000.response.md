Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` checks if a number `n` is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). It returns `True` if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, indicating that the number is odd, and `False` otherwise. This correctly implements the problem description, which asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.

The function handles all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero, and returns the expected results. For example, `func_1(-3)` returns `True`, `func_1(1)` returns `True`, `func_1(3)` returns `True`, `func_1(-2)` returns `False`, `func_1(0)` returns `False`, and `func_1(2)` returns `False`. The function does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, and the provided output hints agree with the code's functionality.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not an integer. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and output hints, the code correctly implements the required functionality for every potential case.
