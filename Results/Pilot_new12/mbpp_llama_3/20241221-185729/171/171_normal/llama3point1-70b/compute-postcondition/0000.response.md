To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state that `n` is an integer. The code `return n % 2!= 0` checks whether the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. This operation essentially determines if `n` is an odd number, because in integer division, a remainder of 0 indicates an even number, while any non-zero remainder indicates an odd number.

Given that `n` is an integer, the possible values of `n % 2` are 0 (if `n` is even) or 1 (if `n` is odd). Therefore, `n % 2!= 0` will be `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

Output State: **The program returns True if `n` is an odd integer, False if `n` is an even integer**
