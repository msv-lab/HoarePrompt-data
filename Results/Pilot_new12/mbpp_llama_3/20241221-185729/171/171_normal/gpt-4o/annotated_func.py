#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given integer `n` is odd or even, returning `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, covering all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero, with no modification to the input variable `n`.
