The expression `n % 2!= 0` checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. This means it checks if `n` is an odd number. Since `n` is an integer, the expression will return `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

Output State: **The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer**
