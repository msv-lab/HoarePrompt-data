You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
Program:
```
assert func_1(12) == False
assert func_1(7) == True
assert func_1(10) == False

def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the parity of a given number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, which means the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating the number is even.

This function correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False`, demonstrate its correctness for both even and odd numbers.

Additionally, considering the definition of odd and even numbers:

- An even number can be represented as `2k` where `k` is an integer. For any even number, `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`.
- An odd number can be represented as `2k + 1` where `k` is an integer. For any odd number, `n % 2` will not be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`.

Therefore, the function correctly handles all integers, whether positive, negative, or zero, because the modulus operation in Python works as expected with negative numbers and zero. For example, `(-5) % 2` equals `-1`, which is not equal to 0, correctly identifying `-5` as an odd number. Similarly, `0 % 2` equals `0`, correctly identifying `0` as an even number.

Since we cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(12) == False
assert func_1(7) == True
assert func_1(10) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
