Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the parity of a given number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, which means the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating the number is even.

This function correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False`, demonstrate its correctness for both even and odd numbers.

Additionally, considering the definition of odd and even numbers:

- An even number can be represented as `2k` where `k` is an integer. For any even number, `n % 2` will be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`.
- An odd number can be represented as `2k + 1` where `k` is an integer. For any odd number, `n % 2` will not be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`.

Therefore, the function correctly handles all integers, whether positive, negative, or zero, because the modulus operation in Python works as expected with negative numbers and zero. For example, `(-5) % 2` equals `-1`, which is not equal to 0, correctly identifying `-5` as an odd number. Similarly, `0 % 2` equals `0`, correctly identifying `0` as an even number.

Since we cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
