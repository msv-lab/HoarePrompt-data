Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, then `n` is an odd integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, `n` is an even integer, and the function returns `False`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves correctly for both odd and even numbers. Additionally, the function's behavior is well-documented in the comments, which helps to ensure that it meets the problem description.

One key point is that the problem description only asks to determine if a number is odd, and the function does exactly that. It does not try to do anything more or less than required, which makes it a correct solution to the problem.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality, handles all potential cases (positive, negative, and zero integers), and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
