The original assessment is based on the problem description, which asks to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided code, `func_1(n)`, checks if a number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, indicating the number is odd, and `False` otherwise, indicating the number is even.

The output hints confirm this functionality, stating that the function determines whether a given integer `n` is odd or even, covering all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero, without modifying the input variable `n`. The hints align with the code's behavior and support the original assessment.

Upon reviewing the code, problem description, and output hints, it's evident that the function accurately implements the required logic. The assertion tests provided (`assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, `assert func_1(10) == False`) demonstrate the function's correctness for both even and odd numbers.

Moreover, the function correctly handles all integers, including negative numbers and zero, as the modulus operation in Python behaves as expected with these values. For instance, `(-5) % 2` equals `-1`, which is not equal to 0, correctly identifying `-5` as an odd number. Similarly, `0 % 2` equals `0`, correctly identifying `0` as an even number.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, the program accurately fulfills its purpose of determining whether a given number is odd.

The reason to maintain the original assessment is that all provided information, including the problem description, the code, the assertion tests, and the output hints, consistently support the correctness of the function. There are no indications or evidence from the output hints or the code itself that suggest the function behaves incorrectly according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
