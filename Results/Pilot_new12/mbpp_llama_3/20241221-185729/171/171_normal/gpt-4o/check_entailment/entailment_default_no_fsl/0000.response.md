Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the number when divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This logic applies to all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate this functionality for different inputs. The output hints agree with the code's behavior, indicating that it correctly determines whether a given integer is odd or even. Since we assume the input will always be a valid integer, the program correctly handles all potential cases.
