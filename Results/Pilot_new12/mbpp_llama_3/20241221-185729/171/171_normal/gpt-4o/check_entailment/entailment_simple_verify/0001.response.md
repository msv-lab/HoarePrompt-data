Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program correctly implements the functionality to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly explains the behavior of the modulus operator (`%`) in the context of the problem. The expression `n % 2!= 0` effectively checks whether the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, which is a fundamental property of odd numbers.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by describing the state of the program before the function call (`n` is an integer) and the return condition of the function (`True` if `n` is an odd integer, `False` if `n` is an even integer). These annotations align with the problem description and the original assessment.

The unit tests provided (`assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, `assert func_1(10) == False`) further demonstrate the correctness of the function for both even and odd numbers.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
