The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The output hints provided also support the correctness of the function. They state that the function determines whether a given integer `n` is odd or even, returning `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, covering all integer cases, including positive, negative, and zero. This description aligns with the behavior of the provided function.

Additionally, the unit tests `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False` all pass, which further supports the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the provided code, the problem description, and the output hints, it appears that the function is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.

Final: **True**
