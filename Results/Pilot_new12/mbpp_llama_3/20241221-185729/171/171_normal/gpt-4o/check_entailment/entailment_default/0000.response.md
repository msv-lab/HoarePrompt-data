Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code checks if a number `n` is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will not be equal to 0, so `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`. If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be equal to 0, so `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`. This logic is correct for all integers, including positive, negative, and zero. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, covering all integer cases. Since the function correctly determines whether a given integer `n` is odd or even, and there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle, the code is correct.
