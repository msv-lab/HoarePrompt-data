Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulo operator (`n % 2!= 0`). This condition is true if and only if `n` is an odd integer.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The problem description asks to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.
2. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.
3. The function uses the correct mathematical condition to check for odd parity: `n % 2!= 0`. This condition is true if and only if `n` is odd.
4. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for both odd and even inputs.

Since the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, the correctness of the program is **True**.
