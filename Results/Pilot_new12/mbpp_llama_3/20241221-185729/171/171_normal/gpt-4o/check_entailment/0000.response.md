Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The unit tests provided, `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False`, all pass, which suggests that the function works correctly for these specific cases.

Additionally, the logic of the function is sound and should work for all integer inputs, both positive and negative. For example, `func_1(-3)` will correctly return `True` because -3 is an odd number.

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. For instance, it correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, returning `False`, which is the expected result for an even number.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the function is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
