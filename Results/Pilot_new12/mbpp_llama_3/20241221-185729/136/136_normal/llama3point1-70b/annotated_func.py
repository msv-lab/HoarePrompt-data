#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with numeric values, and n is a number.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary that includes key-value pairs from dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` with numeric values and a number `n`, filters the dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, and returns this filtered dictionary. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or no key-value pairs meet the condition, the function returns an empty dictionary. The function preserves the original dictionary `d` and does not modify it. It handles cases where the input values are numeric and does not perform any error checking for non-numeric values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a new dictionary containing a subset of key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d`, based on the condition specified by the number `n`.
