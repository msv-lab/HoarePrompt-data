# Explanation of the program's correctness
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as input. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the input dictionary and return a new dictionary that only includes key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

This is precisely what the problem description asks for, as it requires a function that filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. 

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality for all possible valid inputs (i.e., a dictionary with numeric values and a number), it meets the problem description.

# Correctness: **True**
