Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(d, n)` correctly filters a dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary.
2. The dictionary comprehension iterates over each key-value pair `(k, v)` in the input dictionary `d`.
3. The `if` condition `v >= n` filters the pairs to include only those with values `v` that are greater than or equal to `n`.
4. The resulting dictionary contains only the key-value pairs that pass the filter condition.

Since this code handles all potential cases and correctly filters the dictionary according to the problem description, it is correct. 

For example, if you have a dictionary `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}` and an integer `n = 3`, the function will return `{'c': 3, 'd': 4}`, which are the entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. 

You can also test this function with edge cases, such as an empty dictionary or a dictionary with all values less than `n`, and it will behave correctly. 

Therefore, the code is correct and will produce the expected results for all possible inputs.
