Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary, only including key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This directly aligns with the problem description's requirement to filter the dictionary based on this condition.

2. **Handling of Input**: Although the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., `d` is a dictionary with numeric values and `n` is a number), the function does not explicitly check for non-numeric values. However, since the assumption is that the input will always be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program regarding the specified problem description.

3. **Preservation of Original Dictionary**: The function creates a new dictionary with the filtered key-value pairs without modifying the original dictionary `d`. This meets the problem description's requirement that the function should not alter the input dictionary.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns a dictionary containing the filtered key-value pairs. If the input dictionary is empty or no key-value pairs meet the condition, an empty dictionary is returned, which is in line with the expected behavior described.

5. **Error Handling**: As per the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid, the program does not need to include error checking for non-numeric values, empty dictionaries, or other potential edge cases beyond the functionality described.

In summary, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description: it filters a dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to a given integer `n`, preserves the original dictionary, and returns the filtered dictionary. Given the assumption of valid input, it fulfills its specified purpose without the need for additional error checking or handling.
