Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs and returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is achieved through a dictionary comprehension that iterates over each key-value pair in `d` and filters out those where the value is less than `n`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty dictionaries: The function will return an empty dictionary if `d` is empty, which is the expected behavior.
- Dictionaries with no qualifying values: If no values in `d` are greater than or equal to `n`, the function will return an empty dictionary, as expected.
- Dictionaries with all qualifying values: If all values in `d` are greater than or equal to `n`, the function will return a dictionary identical to `d`, which is the expected behavior.
- Dictionaries with mixed qualifying and non-qualifying values: The function will correctly include only the key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n` in the returned dictionary.

Since the program correctly handles every potential case according to the problem description, it is considered correct.
