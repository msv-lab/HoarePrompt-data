Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. It filters the input dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to the specified number `n`. 

The code uses dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the filtered key-value pairs, which preserves the original dictionary `d` and does not modify it. It handles cases where the input dictionary `d` is empty or no key-value pairs meet the condition by returning an empty dictionary.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function filters the dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n` and returns this filtered dictionary. They also mention that the function preserves the original dictionary `d` and does not modify it, which is consistent with the code.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking for non-numeric values does not affect the correctness of the program. The program is designed to work with numeric values, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case within this assumption.
