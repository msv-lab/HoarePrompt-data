Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(d, n)` filters the input dictionary `d` to only include key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the filtered entries, preserving the original dictionary `d` and not modifying it.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function returns a new dictionary containing a subset of key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d`, based on the condition specified by the number `n`. The hints also mention that the function handles cases where the input dictionary `d` is empty or no key-value pairs meet the condition, in which case it returns an empty dictionary.

The code does not perform any error checking for non-numeric values, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern. The code correctly filters the dictionary for every potential case, including when the input dictionary is empty or when no key-value pairs meet the condition.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
