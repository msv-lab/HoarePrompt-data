Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` with numeric values and a number `n`, filters the dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, and returns this filtered dictionary. If the input dictionary `d` is empty or no key-value pairs meet the condition, the function returns an empty dictionary. The function preserves the original dictionary `d` and does not modify it. It handles cases where the input values are numeric and does not perform any error checking for non-numeric values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a new dictionary containing a subset of key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d`, based on the condition specified by the number `n`.**
