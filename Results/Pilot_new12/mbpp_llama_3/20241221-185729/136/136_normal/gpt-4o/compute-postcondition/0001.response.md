The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d` and `n`. `d` is a dictionary where all values are comparable to integers, and `n` is an integer. The function returns a dictionary with keys from the original dictionary `d` and values that are comparable to integers and are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` with integer-comparable values and an integer `n`, and returns a dictionary with keys from `d` and values greater than or equal to `n`.**
