#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where all values are comparable to integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary with keys from the original dictionary `d` and values that are comparable to integers and are greater than or equal to the integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` filters a given dictionary `d` based on a threshold integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function handles dictionaries with integer-comparable values and does not modify the original dictionary. It assumes that all values in the dictionary can be compared to integers, and it does not include any error handling for cases where values might not be comparable. The returned dictionary will be empty if no values in `d` are greater than or equal to `n`. The function effectively performs a selection operation on the dictionary, reducing it to only those entries that meet the specified criteria.
