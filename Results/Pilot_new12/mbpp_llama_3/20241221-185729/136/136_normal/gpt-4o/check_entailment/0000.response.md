Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` filters a dictionary `d` to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. This is achieved using a dictionary comprehension, which creates a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it:

1. Iterates over all key-value pairs in the input dictionary.
2. Applies the correct condition (`v >= n`) to filter the pairs.
3. Returns a new dictionary containing only the pairs that meet the condition.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios, and it handles edge cases such as empty dictionaries (although no test is provided for this case, the function will still work correctly) and dictionaries with single or multiple entries.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement for all possible inputs, it is considered correct.
