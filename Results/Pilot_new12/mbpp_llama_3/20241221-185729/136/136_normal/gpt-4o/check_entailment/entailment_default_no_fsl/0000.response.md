Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is achieved through the dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}`, which iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary and includes it in the new dictionary only if the value meets the specified condition.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including cases where no values in the dictionary are greater than or equal to `n`, in which case an empty dictionary is returned. The function does not modify the original dictionary, as required.

The output hints provided support the correctness of the code, giving examples of how the function filters the dictionary based on different values of `n`. The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input (i.e., a dictionary with comparable values and a positive integer `n`). Therefore, the code is correct according to the problem description.
