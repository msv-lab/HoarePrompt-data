Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The code correctly filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a given integer `n`, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The output hints provide additional context and clarify the expected behavior of the function, but they do not reveal any inconsistencies or issues with the code. The hints confirm that the function handles dictionaries with integer-comparable values, does not modify the original dictionary, and returns an empty dictionary if no values meet the specified criteria.

The original assessment mentions several test cases that support the correctness of the program, including different scenarios where there are multiple entries with values greater than or equal to `n`, only one entry with a value greater than or equal to `n`, and when the value of `n` is equal to a value in the dictionary. The assessment also suggests additional test cases to further verify the correctness of the program.

Given the information available, there is no evidence to suggest that the program is incorrect or that the original assessment needs to be revised. The code and output hints align with the problem description, and the assessment provides a thorough evaluation of the program's behavior.

Final: **True**
