The original assessment states that the program is correct, which aligns with the provided problem description and code. Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the function `func_1` indeed filters a dictionary to include only key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to the given integer `n`.

The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the program's behavior, including the state before the function call and the expected output. It mentions that the function assumes all values in the dictionary can be compared to integers and does not include error handling for cases where values might not be comparable. However, based on the problem description, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be valid and comparable.

The original assessment mentions several test cases that the program passes, including cases with multiple entries, a single entry, and when the value of `n` is equal to a value in the dictionary. Additionally, it suggests further test cases to verify the correctness of the program, such as an empty dictionary and a dictionary with all values less than `n`. These test cases demonstrate the program's ability to handle various input scenarios.

The annotated version of the code reinforces the original assessment by providing a detailed explanation of the function's behavior and assumptions. It highlights that the function performs a selection operation on the dictionary, reducing it to only those entries that meet the specified criteria, which aligns with the problem description.

Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is indeed correct. The original assessment accurately identifies the program's behavior and provides a thorough justification for its correctness.

Final: **True**
