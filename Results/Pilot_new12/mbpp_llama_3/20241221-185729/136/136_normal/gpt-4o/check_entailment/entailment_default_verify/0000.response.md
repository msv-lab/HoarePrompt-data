The original assessment claims that the program is correct, and upon reviewing the provided code, problem description, and output hints, it appears that this assessment is accurate.

The code implements a function `func_1` that filters a dictionary based on a given threshold integer `n`, returning a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function that filters a dictionary in the same manner.

The output hints further support the correctness of the program by providing additional details about its behavior, such as:

- The function handles dictionaries with integer-comparable values.
- It does not modify the original dictionary.
- The returned dictionary will be empty if no values meet the specified criteria.

These hints do not reveal any issues or discrepancies with the original assessment. Instead, they reinforce the understanding that the function is designed to perform a specific filtering operation on a dictionary, and it does so without introducing any modifications to the original data structure.

Given that the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, there is no reason to alter the original assessment.

Final: **True**
