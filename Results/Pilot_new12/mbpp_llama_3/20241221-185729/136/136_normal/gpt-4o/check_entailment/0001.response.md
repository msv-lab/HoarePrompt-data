Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct. It filters a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the program. They cover different cases, including when there are multiple entries with values greater than or equal to `n`, when there is only one entry with a value greater than or equal to `n`, and when the value of `n` is equal to a value in the dictionary.

To further verify the correctness of the program, we could consider additional test cases, such as:

- An empty dictionary: `assert func_1({}, 170) == {}`
- A dictionary with all values less than `n`: `assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 165, 'Alden Cantrell': 160, 'Kierra Gentry': 155, 'Pierre Cox': 150}, 170) == {}`
- A dictionary with all values greater than or equal to `n`: `assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 170, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170) == {'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 170, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`

However, based on the provided code and unit tests, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
