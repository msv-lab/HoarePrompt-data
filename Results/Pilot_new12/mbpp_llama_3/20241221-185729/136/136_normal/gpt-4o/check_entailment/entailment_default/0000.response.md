Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct because it filters a given dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The output hints agree with the code, indicating that it handles dictionaries with integer-comparable values and does not modify the original dictionary. Additionally, the function includes several assertion statements that demonstrate its correctness for different input cases. These assertion statements show that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including different dictionary values and threshold integers. The code also handles cases where the returned dictionary will be empty if no values in the original dictionary are greater than or equal to `n`. Overall, based on the code, output hints, and assertion statements, it appears that the function correctly filters the dictionary according to the specified criteria for every potential case.
