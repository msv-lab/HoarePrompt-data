Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is done using the condition `v >= n` in the dictionary comprehension.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the program. They show that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios, such as when there are multiple entries with values greater than or equal to `n`, and when there is only one entry with a value greater than or equal to `n`.

In general, the program will always do what the problem description says because it uses a dictionary comprehension with a conditional statement to filter the dictionary, which ensures that only the key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n` are included in the resulting dictionary.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`.
2. The dictionary comprehension iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d`.
3. For each key-value pair, the condition `v >= n` is checked. If the value is greater than or equal to `n`, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary.
4. The resulting dictionary includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. The function returns the resulting dictionary.

Overall, the program correctly filters the dictionary to include only the key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n`, as specified in the problem description.
