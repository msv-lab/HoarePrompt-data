The code calculates the common elements between `list1` and `list2` and assigns them to `common_elements`. 

`common_elements` is assigned the value of the intersection of `set(list1)` and `set(list2)`, which means it will contain the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. The states of `list1` and `list2` are not affected.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `common_elements` is a set of elements present in both `list1` and `list2`.**
