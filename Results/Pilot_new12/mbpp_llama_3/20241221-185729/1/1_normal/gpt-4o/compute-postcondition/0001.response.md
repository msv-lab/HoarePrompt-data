To calculate the output, we consider the given initial state: `list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, and `common_elements` is a set of elements present in both `list1` and `list2`. The code provided is `return tuple(sorted(common_elements))`.

1. **Identification of Common Elements**: The `common_elements` set contains all unique elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. This means any element that appears in either list, regardless of its frequency, will be included in the set as long as it appears in both lists at least once.

2. **Sorting the Common Elements**: The `sorted()` function sorts the elements of the `common_elements` set in ascending order. Since sets are unordered, sorting transforms the set into a list (which is ordered), with elements arranged from smallest to largest.

3. **Conversion to Tuple**: The `tuple()` function then converts this sorted list back into a tuple. Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation.

The code returns a tuple that contains all the elements present in both `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the elements common to both list1 and list2, sorted in ascending order.**
