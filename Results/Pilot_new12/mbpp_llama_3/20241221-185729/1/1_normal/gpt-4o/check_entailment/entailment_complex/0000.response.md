Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the shared elements from two given lists, and the program does exactly that. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input parameters.
2. It converts both lists to sets using the `set()` function, which removes any duplicate elements and has an efficient lookup time.
3. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements common to both `list1` and `list2`.
4. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the common elements in ascending order.
5. Finally, the `tuple()` function is used to convert the sorted list of common elements into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

The program handles all possible cases as specified in the problem description:

- If the input lists are empty, the function returns an empty tuple.
- If the input lists have no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.
- If the input lists have duplicate elements, the function ignores them by converting the lists to sets.
- If the input lists have common elements, the function returns a tuple containing the unique common elements in ascending order.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly, it is considered correct.
