Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from two given lists. It first converts the input lists to sets, which removes any duplicate elements. The `&` operator is then used to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives the elements that are common to both lists. Finally, the common elements are sorted in ascending order and returned as a tuple.

The output hints agree with the code and describe its functionality accurately. The function handles cases where the input lists are empty or have no common elements correctly, returning an empty tuple in such cases. It also ignores duplicate elements in the input lists, as the problem description does not specify what to do with duplicates.

All the provided unit tests also pass with the given function, which further confirms its correctness. The function works for every potential case, assuming that the input will be valid, as specified in the problem description.
