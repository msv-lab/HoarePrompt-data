Correctness: **True**

The program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples (or lists) as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from both lists. The function uses Python's built-in `set` data structure to find the intersection of the two input lists, which gives us the common elements. The `sorted` function is then used to ensure the returned tuple is ordered.

Here's why the code works as expected for every potential case:

1. **Handling Duplicate Elements:** Since the function converts the input lists to sets, any duplicate elements within each list are automatically removed. This means the function can handle lists with duplicates correctly, although the problem description does not explicitly address how duplicates should be handled in the output. If the intention is to preserve duplicates (i.e., report each shared element as many times as it appears in both lists), this code would not achieve that. However, based on the provided assertions, the desired behavior seems to be to report each shared element once, which this code correctly does.

2. **Handling Empty Lists:** If one or both of the input lists are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple, because the intersection of any set with an empty set is an empty set. This behavior aligns with the expectation that there would be no shared elements in such cases.

3. **Ordering of Output:** The function sorts the common elements before returning them. This ensures that the output is consistent, independent of the order of elements in the input lists. Given the unit tests, which expect the output in sorted order, this behavior is correct.

4. **Type Flexibility:** Although the problem description and unit tests use tuples, the function would work just as well with lists (or any other iterable), because it converts the inputs to sets. This flexibility is beneficial but does not affect the correctness regarding the specific problem statement.

In summary, given the provided assertions and considering potential variations in input (including empty lists, lists with duplicates, and different orders of elements), the code behaves as intended according to the problem description. No case has been found where the program does not work as expected, and thus, it is considered correct.
