Based on the provided information, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The code correctly implements a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. It uses sets to find the common elements, which automatically removes duplicates, and returns the result as a sorted tuple. The output hints also support the correctness of the program, as they describe the expected behavior of the function.

The function handles various cases correctly, including empty input lists, duplicate elements, and non-integer elements. The use of sets ensures that the function only returns each shared element once, and the sorting of the result ensures that the output is in ascending order.

The output hints provided do not introduce any new information that would suggest the original assessment is incorrect. They simply reiterate the expected behavior of the function, which is consistent with the code implementation.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
