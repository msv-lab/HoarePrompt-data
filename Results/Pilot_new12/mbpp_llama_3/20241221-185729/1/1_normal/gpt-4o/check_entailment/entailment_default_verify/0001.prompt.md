You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples (or lists) as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from both lists. The function uses Python's built-in `set` data structure to find the intersection of the two input lists, which gives us the common elements. The `sorted` function is then used to ensure the returned tuple is ordered.

Here's why the code works as expected for every potential case:

1. **Handling Duplicate Elements:** Since the function converts the input lists to sets, any duplicate elements within each list are automatically removed. This means the function can handle lists with duplicates correctly, although the problem description does not explicitly address how duplicates should be handled in the output. If the intention is to preserve duplicates (i.e., report each shared element as many times as it appears in both lists), this code would not achieve that. However, based on the provided assertions, the desired behavior seems to be to report each shared element once, which this code correctly does.

2. **Handling Empty Lists:** If one or both of the input lists are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple, because the intersection of any set with an empty set is an empty set. This behavior aligns with the expectation that there would be no shared elements in such cases.

3. **Ordering of Output:** The function sorts the common elements before returning them. This ensures that the output is consistent, independent of the order of elements in the input lists. Given the unit tests, which expect the output in sorted order, this behavior is correct.

4. **Type Flexibility:** Although the problem description and unit tests use tuples, the function would work just as well with lists (or any other iterable), because it converts the inputs to sets. This flexibility is beneficial but does not affect the correctness regarding the specific problem statement.

In summary, given the provided assertions and considering potential variations in input (including empty lists, lists with duplicates, and different orders of elements), the code behaves as intended according to the problem description. No case has been found where the program does not work as expected, and thus, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as parameters and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both lists, sorted in ascending order. The function handles duplicate elements by ignoring them, as it converts the input lists to sets before finding the common elements. If the input lists are empty or have no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple. The function does not modify the original input lists and only returns the common elements, without preserving their original order or frequency in the input lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
