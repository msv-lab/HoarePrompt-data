The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after analyzing the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, I agree with this assessment.

The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input, converts them to sets, finds the common elements using the set intersection operator `&`, sorts the common elements in ascending order, and returns them as a tuple.

The annotated version of the code indicates that the program returns a tuple containing the elements common to both input lists, sorted in ascending order, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function handles various cases, including empty input lists, duplicate elements, non-integer elements, and unordered input lists. Although the annotated version does not explicitly mention these cases, the code itself supports the assessment.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid, the program does not need to handle cases like empty lists, non-list inputs, or invalid data types. The code is designed to work with valid inputs, and it correctly implements the required functionality.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
