Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the shared elements from the given two lists. The program achieves this by converting the input lists to sets, finding their intersection using the `&` operator, and then returning the common elements as a tuple in ascending order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `set(list1)` and `set(list2)` convert the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list.
2. `set(list1) & set(list2)` finds the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements that are common to both `list1` and `list2`.
3. `tuple(sorted(common_elements))` converts the set of common elements to a tuple and sorts it in ascending order before returning it.

The program handles the problem description's requirements correctly for all potential cases, assuming valid input (i.e., non-empty lists). The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the program's correctness for various input scenarios. 

For example, given two lists `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`, the program correctly identifies the shared elements as `(4, 5)`, which is the expected output according to the problem description.
