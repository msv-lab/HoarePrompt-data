Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists (or tuples, in this case) as input and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both lists, sorted in ascending order.

The use of sets (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) ensures that duplicate elements are ignored, and the conversion to a tuple and sorting (`tuple(sorted(common_elements))`) produces the desired output format.

The function handles edge cases such as empty input lists or lists with no common elements by returning an empty tuple, which is consistent with the problem description.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior. The code does not modify the original input lists and only returns the common elements, without preserving their original order or frequency.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs. The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and no cases can be found where the program does not work as expected.
