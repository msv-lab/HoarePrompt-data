The original assessment and the output hints both suggest that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from two lists, ignores duplicate elements, handles empty lists, and returns the common elements in sorted order without modifying the original lists. The output hints align with the original assessment, reinforcing the understanding of the program's functionality.

Given the information provided:
- The function converts input lists to sets, which removes duplicates and efficiently finds common elements.
- It handles empty lists by returning an empty tuple, as the intersection of any set with an empty set is empty.
- The use of `sorted` ensures the output is in ascending order, meeting the expectations set by the unit tests and output hints.
- The function's type flexibility, working with any iterable, is a benefit though not explicitly required by the problem statement.

There is no evidence from the annotations, the original assessment, or the output hints that suggests the program fails to meet the problem description or behaves incorrectly under the assumptions provided (i.e., assuming valid input).

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Final: **True**
