Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. It does this by converting the input lists to sets and using the set intersection operator `&` to find the common elements. The result is then sorted in ascending order and returned as a tuple.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty input lists: If either or both of the input lists are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is the expected result.
* Duplicate elements: If there are duplicate elements in either of the input lists, the function will only return each shared element once, as sets automatically remove duplicates.
* Non-integer elements: Although the unit tests provided only use integers, the function will also work correctly with lists containing other types of elements, such as strings or floats.
* Unordered input lists: The function does not require the input lists to be sorted, as it uses sets to find the common elements.

Overall, the function is well-designed and correctly implements the required functionality, making it a correct solution to the problem.
