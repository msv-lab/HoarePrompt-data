The code converts the input lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` into sets, finds their intersection using the `&` operator, and returns the result as a tuple. 

Since `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists, when they are converted to sets, the resulting sets will contain unique elements from each list.

The intersection of these two sets will be a set containing elements that are common to both lists.

Finally, this resulting set is converted back into a tuple, which is then returned.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both test_tup1 and test_tup2 lists**
