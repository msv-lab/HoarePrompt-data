Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. It does this by converting the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list, and then finds the intersection of the two sets, which gives the elements common to both lists.

The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which, despite being named as tuples, are expected to be lists based on the problem description. It returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both input lists.

The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the program, including how it treats the input lists as sets (ignoring order and removing duplicates), the handling of empty lists, and the potential for unexpected behavior if inputs are not lists.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., the inputs are lists as expected, and they do not cause any errors), the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It handles cases where either or both of the input lists are empty, returning an empty tuple as expected. It also correctly identifies and returns the unique common elements between the two lists.

Thus, the code operates as intended for every potential case under the given assumptions, making it correct according to the problem description.
