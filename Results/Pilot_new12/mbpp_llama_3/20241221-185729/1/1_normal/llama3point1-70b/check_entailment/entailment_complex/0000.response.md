Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description requirements. It finds the shared elements from the given two lists. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` lists.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1.  It takes two lists as input: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.
2.  It converts the lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list.
3.  It finds the intersection of the two sets, which gives the elements common to both lists. The `&` operator is used for this purpose.
4.  It converts the resulting set back to a tuple and returns it. This tuple contains the unique elements common to both input lists.
5.  If either `test_tup1` or `test_tup2` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple, as the intersection of a set with an empty set is an empty set.
6.  If `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` have no common elements, the function will also return an empty tuple, as the intersection of two disjoint sets is an empty set.

Since the program correctly finds the shared elements from the given two lists and handles edge cases as expected, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here is an example of the function's usage:
```python
test_tup1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
test_tup2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

result = func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2)
print(result)  # Output: (3, 4)
```
