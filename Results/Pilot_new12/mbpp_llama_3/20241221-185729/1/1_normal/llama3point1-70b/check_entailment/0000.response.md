Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from both tuples. This is achieved by converting the tuples to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements, and then using the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, i.e., the elements that are common to both sets. The result is then converted back to a tuple.

The program works correctly for all potential cases because set operations in Python are well-defined and work as expected. The program correctly handles:

*   Empty tuples: If either of the input tuples is empty, the result will be an empty tuple, which is correct because there are no shared elements.
*  Duplicate elements: If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, the set conversion will remove these duplicates, which is correct because the problem statement does not specify what to do with duplicates, but returning only unique shared elements is a reasonable interpretation.
*   Non-unique tuples: The program works correctly even if the input tuples are not unique, i.e., they contain duplicate elements.
*   Tuples with different lengths: The program works correctly for tuples of different lengths, correctly identifying the shared elements regardless of the length of the tuples.

Since I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
