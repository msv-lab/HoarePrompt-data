Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input. It uses the `set` intersection operator `&` to find the shared elements between the two tuples and returns them as a tuple.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When the tuples have common elements, the function returns a tuple of shared elements.
- When the tuples have no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.
- When the tuples are empty, the function returns an empty tuple.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:
```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)))  # Output: (2, 3)
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)))  # Output: ()
print(func_1((), (1, 2, 3)))  # Output: ()
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), ()))  # Output: ()
```
The function handles all possible scenarios, and the use of `set` intersection ensures that the shared elements are returned without duplicates. Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description.
