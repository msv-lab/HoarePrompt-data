Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given code defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples (or lists, as mentioned in the problem description) as input and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both. The code uses the set intersection operator `&` to find the common elements between the two input sets. 

Although the function parameters are named `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, suggesting they are tuples, the problem description mentions that they are expected to be lists. However, since tuples and lists are both iterable and can be converted to sets, this discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the code. 

The function treats the input lists as sets, ignoring the order of elements and removing any duplicates within each list. This is in line with the problem description, which asks for the shared elements from the given two lists without specifying any particular order or handling of duplicates. 

The output hints agree with the code and mention various cases, including when either list is empty or when there are no common elements. In these cases, the function correctly returns an empty tuple.

Since the problem description assumes valid input and does not specify error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-list inputs), we consider the code correct under the assumption that the user will always provide valid lists as input. The code handles the cases mentioned in the problem description correctly and does not contain any logical errors that would cause it to produce incorrect results for valid input lists.
