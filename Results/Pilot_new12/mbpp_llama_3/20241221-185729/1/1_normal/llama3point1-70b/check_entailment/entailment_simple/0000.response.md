Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem asks to find the shared elements from two given lists, and the function `func_1` achieves this by converting the input lists to sets and finding their intersection using the `&` operator. The result is then converted back to a tuple, which contains the unique elements common to both input lists.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes two lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
2. The `set()` function is used to convert the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements.
3. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets, which results in a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets.
4. The resulting set is converted back to a tuple using the `tuple()` function.
5. The tuple is then returned by the function, containing the unique elements that are shared between the two input lists.

This implementation is correct for all potential cases, assuming valid input is provided, as stated in the problem description. The use of sets ensures that duplicate elements are removed, and the intersection operation finds the common elements between the two lists.
