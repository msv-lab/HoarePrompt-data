To calculate the output state, let's break down the given information and the impact of the code:

1. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists.
2. `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.
3. `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length equal to `max_len`.

The code `return max_len, max_sublists[0]` returns two values:
- `max_len`: This is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. 
- `max_sublists[0]`: This is the first sublist from `max_sublists`, which means it is one of the sublists from `list_of_lists` with the maximum length (`max_len`).

Given this information:

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist that has this maximum length.**
