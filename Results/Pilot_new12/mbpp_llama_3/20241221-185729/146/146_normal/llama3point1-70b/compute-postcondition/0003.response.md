The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist that has this maximum length. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists, determine the maximum length of the sublists, identify the first sublist with this maximum length, and return both values as a tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists, and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist with this maximum length.**
