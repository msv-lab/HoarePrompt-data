The code creates a new list `max_sublists` that includes only the sublists from `list_of_lists` with a length equal to `max_len`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The `max_sublists` list includes all sublists from `list_of_lists` where the length of the sublist is equal to `max_len`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length equal to `max_len`**
