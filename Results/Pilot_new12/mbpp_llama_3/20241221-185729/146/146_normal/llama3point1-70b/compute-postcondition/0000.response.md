To calculate the result, we first look at the initial state: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. The provided code snippet is `max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`. This line of code calculates the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists` and assigns this value to `max_len`.

Given that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, the code iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the length of each sublist using `len(sublist)`, and then finds the maximum of these lengths using the `max()` function. The result is assigned to `max_len`.

So, `max_len` is equal to the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`**
