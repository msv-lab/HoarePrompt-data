Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the program only returns the first sublist with the maximum length, not all of them.

Here's a case where the program does not work correctly:
```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
result = func_1(list_of_lists)
print(result)  # Expected output: ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]) or all sublists with max length
              # Actual output: (3, [1, 2, 3])
```
In this case, the program returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, ignoring the other sublists with the same maximum length.

A correct implementation should return all sublists with the maximum length, like this:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```
This corrected implementation returns all sublists with the maximum length, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
