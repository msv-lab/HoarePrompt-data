Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, which implies that the function should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one encountered. However, the given code only returns the first sublist with the maximum length.

For example, if we have a list of lists `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`, the code will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]])` because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 8]` have the maximum length of 3.

This indicates that the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
