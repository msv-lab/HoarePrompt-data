Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that returns the "list of maximum length in a list of lists". However, the provided function returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and only the first sublist that has this maximum length.

In cases where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function will only return the first one, not all of them. This does not meet the requirement of returning the "list of maximum length", which should be a list of all sublists that have the maximum length.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`, the function will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `[[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]]` because both of these sublists have the maximum length.

To fix this, the function should return `max_sublists` instead of `max_sublists[0]`, which will return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length. The corrected function would be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```
