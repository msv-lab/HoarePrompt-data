You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist that has this maximum length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in the list and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the first one encountered is returned. The function assumes that the input list is not empty and that it contains at least one sublist. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an error when trying to calculate the maximum length of sublists. If a sublist with the maximum length is not found (which should not happen given the implementation), the function will raise an error when trying to access the first sublist with the maximum length. The input list and its sublists remain unchanged after the function call, as the function only reads from the input and does not modify it.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
