You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given function is supposed to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but it returns a tuple where the first element is the maximum length and the second element is only the first sublist with that maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should return all of them, but it only returns the first one.

For example, if we call `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])`, the function returns `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]])` because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 8]` have the maximum length of 3.

To fix this, the function should return `(max_len, max_sublists)`, where `max_sublists` is the list of all sublists with the maximum length. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in the list and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the first one encountered is returned. The function assumes that the input list is not empty and that it contains at least one sublist. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an error when trying to calculate the maximum length of sublists. If a sublist with the maximum length is not found (which should not happen given the implementation), the function will raise an error when trying to access the first sublist with the maximum length. The input list and its sublists remain unchanged after the function call, as the function only reads from the input and does not modify it.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
