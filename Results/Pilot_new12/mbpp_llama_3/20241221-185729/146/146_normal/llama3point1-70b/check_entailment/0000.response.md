Correctness: **False**.

The given function is supposed to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but it returns a tuple where the first element is the maximum length and the second element is only the first sublist with that maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should return all of them, but it only returns the first one.

For example, if we call `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])`, the function returns `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]])` because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 8]` have the maximum length of 3.

To fix this, the function should return `(max_len, max_sublists)`, where `max_sublists` is the list of all sublists with the maximum length. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
