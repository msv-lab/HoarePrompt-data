Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the **list of maximum length in a list of lists**, but the provided program only returns the **first sublist with the maximum length**. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should ideally return all of them to fulfill the problem's request for the "list of maximum length". 

However, the given program returns a tuple containing the maximum length and only the first sublist that has this maximum length. This means it does not return all sublists of maximum length if there are multiple, which is contrary to what the problem description expects. 

To correct this, the function should return a tuple containing the maximum length and a list of all sublists that have this maximum length. The corrected return statement could look something like this:
```python
return max_len, max_sublists
```
And the description should note that `max_sublists` is a list of all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one encountered.
