The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in the list and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the first one encountered is returned. The function assumes that the input list is not empty and that it contains at least one sublist. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an error when trying to calculate the maximum length of sublists. If a sublist with the maximum length is not found (which should not happen given the implementation), the function will raise an error when trying to access the first sublist with the maximum length. The input list and its sublists remain unchanged after the function call, as the function only reads from the input and does not modify it.
