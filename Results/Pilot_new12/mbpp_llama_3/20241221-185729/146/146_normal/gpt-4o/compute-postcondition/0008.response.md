`max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`, which is the second list in `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` is not affected, and `lst` is still the second list in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to the length of the second list in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`**
