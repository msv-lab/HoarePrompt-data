The code `max_list = lst` assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. Since `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is now equal to the first list in `list_of_lists`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `list_of_lists` is still a list of lists that must have at least 1 list, `max_len` is still equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, and `lst` is still the first list in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 list, `max_len` is equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the first list in `list_of_lists`, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`**
