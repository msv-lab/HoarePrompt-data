The code assigns `lst` to `max_list`. The initial state is that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`. 

After executing the code, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, which is the third list in `list_of_lists`. The values of `list_of_lists`, `lst`, and `max_len` are not changed.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`**
