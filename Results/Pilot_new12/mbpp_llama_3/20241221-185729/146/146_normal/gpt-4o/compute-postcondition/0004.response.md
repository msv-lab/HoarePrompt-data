The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the length of `lst`. The length of `lst` is greater than the initial value of `max_len`, which is 0. 

The new value of `max_len` is equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`. The values of `list_of_lists`, `max_list`, and `lst` are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 list, `max_len` is equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`**
