The code assigns `max_list` the value of `lst`. The values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` are not affected. Since `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists` and `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, these relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`**
