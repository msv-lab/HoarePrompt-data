According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 lists and `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`. The states of `max_len` and `max_list` remain dependent on the length of `lst` and the value of `max_len` after the previous iteration, but they do not affect the loop execution.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`**
