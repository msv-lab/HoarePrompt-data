To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 list.
- `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`.
- The state of `max_len` and `max_list` depends on the length of `lst` compared to the original `max_len`, but their exact values aren't specified.

Loop statement:
```python
for lst in list_of_lists:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, it means the loop has not yet iterated over all lists in `list_of_lists`. Given that `lst` is currently the first list, for the loop to continue, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists. 

At the start of the next iteration:
- `list_of_lists` must still be a list of lists but now it is known to have at least 2 lists because we are considering the next iteration.
- `lst` will be the second list in `list_of_lists` because the loop iterates over each list in `list_of_lists` sequentially.

The state of `max_len` and `max_list` might change based on the operations within the loop body (which are not provided), but based solely on the loop statement and the previous state, we can only adjust the understanding of `list_of_lists` and `lst`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`**
