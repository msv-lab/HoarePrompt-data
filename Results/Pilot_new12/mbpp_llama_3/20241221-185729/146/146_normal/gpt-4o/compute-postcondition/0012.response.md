To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We are given that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists.
2. `lst` is defined as the third list in `list_of_lists`. This means `lst = list_of_lists[2]`.
3. The code assigns `max_len` the value of the length of `lst`. So, `max_len = len(lst)`.

Given these steps, we don't have specific information about the lengths of the lists within `list_of_lists` or the specific elements they contain. However, we know `lst` is the third list, and `max_len` will be the length of this third list.

Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`**
