#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise 0, and `max_list` is one of the longest lists in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns a tuple containing max_len, which is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise 0, and max_list, which is one of the longest lists in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `list_of_lists` as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` and one of the longest lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns a tuple with 0 and an empty list. The function does not modify the input list of lists, and its result is deterministic in the sense that it will always return the first longest list it encounters in case of multiple lists of the same maximum length. The function covers the edge case where the input list of lists is empty, in which case it returns (0, []) as per the specifications. The function's output is consistent with the return postconditions, which describe the tuple returned as containing the length of the longest list and one of the longest lists if the input is not empty, or (0, []) if the input is empty.
