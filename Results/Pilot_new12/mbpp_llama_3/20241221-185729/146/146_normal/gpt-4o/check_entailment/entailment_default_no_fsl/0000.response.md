Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each list in the `list_of_lists` and checks if the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far. If it is, it updates the `max_len` and `max_list` variables. This approach ensures that the function will always return the first longest list it encounters in case of multiple lists of the same maximum length, which is consistent with the return postconditions described in the output hints.

The function also handles the edge case where the input list of lists is empty, returning `(0, [])` as expected.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including lists with different lengths and an empty list.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or an empty list.

In general, the code seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description, and there are no obvious cases where it would not work as expected.
