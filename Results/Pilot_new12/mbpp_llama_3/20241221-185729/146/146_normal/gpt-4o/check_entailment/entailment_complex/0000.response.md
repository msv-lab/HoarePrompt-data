Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly this.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function iterates over each list in the input `list_of_lists`.
2. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far (`max_len`).
3. If it is, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and stores the current list in `max_list`.
4. After iterating over all lists, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` (the length of the longest list) and `max_list` (one of the longest lists).

This approach ensures that the function will always find the longest list (or one of the longest lists if there are multiple) and return its length and the list itself.

The function also handles the edge case where the input list of lists is empty, as it initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list, which are the correct values to return in this case.

Overall, the function is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
