Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. 

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1.  The function initializes two variables: `max_len` to store the maximum length encountered so far (initialized to 0), and `max_list` to store the list with the maximum length encountered so far (initialized to an empty list).
2.  The function then iterates through each list in the input list of lists.
3.  For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than the `max_len` found so far.
4.  If it is, the function updates `max_len` to be the length of the current list and updates `max_list` to be the current list.
5.  After iterating through all lists, the function returns a tuple containing the maximum length (`max_len`) and the list with the maximum length (`max_list`).
6.  The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios.

Since the code correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases like an empty input list or lists with equal maximum lengths, and the provided unit tests validate its correctness, the program is correct.
