Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it always does what the problem description says. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why it's correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input.
2. It initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list.
3. It then iterates through each list in the input list of lists.
4. If the length of the current list is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and updates `max_list` to the current list.
5. After iterating through all lists, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest list in the input list of lists, and `max_list` will hold one of the longest lists in the input list of lists.
6. The function then returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`, which is the required output according to the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the input list of lists is empty, `max_len` will remain 0 and `max_list` will remain an empty list, which is the correct output.
* If there are multiple lists of the same maximum length, the program will return the first one it encounters, which is a valid output according to the problem description.
* If the input list of lists contains lists of different lengths, the program will correctly identify the longest list and return its length and the list itself.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description.
