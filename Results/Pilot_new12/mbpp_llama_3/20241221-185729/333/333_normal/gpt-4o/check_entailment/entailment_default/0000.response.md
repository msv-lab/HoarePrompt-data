Correctness: **True**

The code checks if the given expression is balanced or not by using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and matching them with the closing brackets. The function handles various edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with mixed types of brackets.

The function works as follows:
- It iterates over each character in the input string.
- If the character is an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`.
- After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, all brackets were properly matched and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets and the function returns `False`.

The provided unit tests and output hints suggest that the function handles various cases correctly, including properly nested brackets, mismatched brackets, and mixed types of brackets. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a string or contains characters other than brackets.

The code appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
