Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets. The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the expression. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match with the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This program correctly handles all potential cases:

- It correctly identifies balanced expressions: The provided unit tests show that it correctly identifies balanced expressions like `'{()}[{}]}'` and `'{()}[{}][]({})'`.
- It correctly identifies unbalanced expressions: The provided unit tests also show that it correctly identifies unbalanced expressions like `'{()}[{]}'`.
- It handles empty expressions: If an empty expression is passed to the function, it will return `True` because the stack will be empty after iterating over the expression.
- It handles expressions with only opening brackets: If an expression with only opening brackets is passed to the function, it will return `False` because the stack will not be empty after iterating over the expression.
- It handles expressions with only closing brackets: If an expression with only closing brackets is passed to the function, it will return `False` because the stack will be empty when it encounters a closing bracket, and the condition `stack == [] or stack.pop()!= matching_pairs[char]` will be true.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
