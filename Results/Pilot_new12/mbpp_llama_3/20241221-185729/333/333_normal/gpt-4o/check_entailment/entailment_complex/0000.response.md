The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a given string expression containing parentheses, brackets, or braces is balanced or not. 

Here is why the program is correct:

1. **Stack Data Structure**: The function utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. This is the most efficient way to solve this problem because stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which is the same order in which brackets need to be matched and closed.

2. **Matching Pairs Dictionary**: The function uses a dictionary `matching_pairs` to store the corresponding closing bracket for each opening bracket. This allows for efficient lookups when a closing bracket is encountered.

3. **Iterating Over the Expression**: The function iterates over each character in the input string `expr`. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it pushes the character onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False` because the brackets are not properly matched.

4. **Returning the Result**: After iterating over the entire expression, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating that all brackets were properly matched and closed) and `False` otherwise.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the problem statement assumes that the input will always be valid, the function is still robust and can handle edge cases such as empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with mixed types of brackets.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to check if a given string expression containing parentheses, brackets, or braces is balanced or not, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
