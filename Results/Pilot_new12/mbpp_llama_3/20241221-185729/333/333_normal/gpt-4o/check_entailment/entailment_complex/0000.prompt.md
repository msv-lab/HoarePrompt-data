You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys ')', ']', and '}' and values '(', '[', and '{' respectively, `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets in `expr`, and `char` is the last character in `expr` if `expr` is not empty.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if all brackets in `expr` are properly matched and closed, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `expr` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in `expr` are properly matched and closed. If the string is empty or all brackets are correctly matched and closed, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, covering cases such as unmatched opening or closing brackets, or brackets that are not properly nested. The function handles various edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with mixed types of brackets. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the input string `expr` remains unchanged, and a boolean result is returned indicating the validity of the bracket matching in the input string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
