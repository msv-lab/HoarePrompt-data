Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty stack `stack` to store the opening brackets.
2. It defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
3. The function then iterates over each character `char` in the input expression `expr`.
4. If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it's pushed onto the stack.
5. If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the expected opening bracket for `char`. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
6. After iterating over all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, that means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The function correctly handles various cases, including:

* Balanced expressions: `'{()}[{}]'`, `'{()}[{}][]({})'`
* Unbalanced expressions: `'{()}[{]'`
* Empty expressions: `''` (not explicitly tested, but the function should return `True` for an empty string)

The function's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
