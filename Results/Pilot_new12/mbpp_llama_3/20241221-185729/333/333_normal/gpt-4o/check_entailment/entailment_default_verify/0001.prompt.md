You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets. The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the expression. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match with the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This program correctly handles all potential cases:

- It correctly identifies balanced expressions: The provided unit tests show that it correctly identifies balanced expressions like `'{()}[{}]}'` and `'{()}[{}][]({})'`.
- It correctly identifies unbalanced expressions: The provided unit tests also show that it correctly identifies unbalanced expressions like `'{()}[{]}'`.
- It handles empty expressions: If an empty expression is passed to the function, it will return `True` because the stack will be empty after iterating over the expression.
- It handles expressions with only opening brackets: If an expression with only opening brackets is passed to the function, it will return `False` because the stack will not be empty after iterating over the expression.
- It handles expressions with only closing brackets: If an expression with only closing brackets is passed to the function, it will return `False` because the stack will be empty when it encounters a closing bracket, and the condition `stack == [] or stack.pop()!= matching_pairs[char]` will be true.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `expr` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in `expr` are properly matched and closed. If the string is empty or all brackets are correctly matched and closed, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, covering cases such as unmatched opening or closing brackets, or brackets that are not properly nested. The function handles various edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with mixed types of brackets. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the input string `expr` remains unchanged, and a boolean result is returned indicating the validity of the bracket matching in the input string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
