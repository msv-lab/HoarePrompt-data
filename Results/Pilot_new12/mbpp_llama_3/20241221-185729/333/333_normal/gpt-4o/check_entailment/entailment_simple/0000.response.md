Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. It checks if a given expression is balanced or not. 

The function `func_1` uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and matches them with the corresponding closing brackets. It iterates over the string `expr` and checks each character. If the character is an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False` indicating that the brackets are not balanced.

After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets have been matched with corresponding closing brackets, so it returns `True` indicating that the brackets are balanced. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `False` indicating that the brackets are not balanced.

The program handles all cases as described in the problem description. It correctly identifies balanced expressions and unbalanced expressions. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program.

For example, when the input is `'{()}[{}]'`, the program returns `True` because the brackets are properly matched and closed. When the input is `'{()}[{]'`, the program returns `False` because the brackets are not properly matched.

Overall, the program correctly checks if a given expression is balanced or not, as required by the problem description.
