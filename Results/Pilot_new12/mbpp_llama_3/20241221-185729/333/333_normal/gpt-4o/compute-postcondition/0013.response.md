The value of `char` is added to the end of `stack`. The value of `expr` and `matching_pairs` remains unchanged. 
`char` is the second character in `expr`, so it can be either an opening bracket, a closing bracket, or not a bracket at all. If `char` is a closing bracket, `stack` should have its corresponding opening bracket at the top. If `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding closing bracket of the current character in `expr` as defined in `matching_pairs`. 

After executing the code, `stack` will have `char` at the top. Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the second character in `expr`, and `stack` will have `char` at the top.
