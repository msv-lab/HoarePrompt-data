According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `expr`. If `expr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, and `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys ')"', ']', and '}'" and values '(', '[', and '{' respectively. However, for the loop to execute, `expr` must have at least 1 character, `char` should be the first character in `expr`, and the `stack` is empty.

State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' as values and ')', ']', '}' as keys respectively, `char` is the first character in `expr`**
