According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `expr` and `char`. If `char` is not the last character in `expr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `expr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `expr` must still be a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces but now with at least 1 character left to process, and `char` must be the next character in `expr` which is the third character. The state of `matching_pairs` remains the same as it does not change based on the loop iteration. The state of `stack` may change based on the value of `char` but for the loop to execute one more time, it will be updated accordingly based on whether `char` is an opening bracket or a closing bracket. 
State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 1 character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the third character in `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket, `stack` has the corresponding opening bracket at the top. If `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is updated accordingly.**
