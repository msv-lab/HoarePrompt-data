Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 2 characters, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the second character in `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket, `stack` has `char` at the top. If `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is updated accordingly: if `char` is an opening bracket, the program continues execution without returning False, with `stack` updated to have `char` at the top if it was not already there; if `char` is a closing bracket and `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding opening bracket of `char` as defined in `matching_pairs`, the program returns False; otherwise, if `char` is a closing bracket and `stack` is not empty and the top of `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char`, the program continues execution without returning False, with `stack` having its top element removed.***
