Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 1 character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the third character in `expr`. If `char` is an opening bracket, the program checks if `char` is in `matching_pairs`, if `char` is a closing bracket and the top of `stack` matches the closing bracket `char`, the stack is updated accordingly. If `char` is a closing bracket and either `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match the closing bracket `char`, the program returns False.***
