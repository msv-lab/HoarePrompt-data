Postcondition: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 1 character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the third character in `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket, either the stack is updated accordingly if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket, or the function returns False if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match. If `char` is an opening bracket, it is added to the stack. If `char` is not a bracket, it may be added to the stack as is in some cases.**
