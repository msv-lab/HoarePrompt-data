Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `expr` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in `expr` are properly matched and closed. If the string is empty or all brackets are correctly matched and closed, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, covering cases such as unmatched opening or closing brackets, or brackets that are not properly nested. The function handles various edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with mixed types of brackets. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the input string `expr` remains unchanged, and a boolean result is returned indicating the validity of the bracket matching in the input string.**
