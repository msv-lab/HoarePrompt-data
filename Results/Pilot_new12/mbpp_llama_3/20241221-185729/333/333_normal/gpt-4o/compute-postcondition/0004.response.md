The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the `stack` list. Given the initial state, `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' as values and ')', ']', '}' as keys respectively, and `char` is the first character in `expr` which is one of the closing brackets, i.e., ')', ']', or '}'.

The value of `char` is appended to the `stack`. The other variables `expr`, `matching_pairs` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is a list containing one closing bracket, either ')', ']', or '}' which is the value of `char`, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is one of the closing brackets ')', ']', or '}'**
