To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for char in expr:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character in the string `expr`. 

Given that at the end of the previous iteration:
- `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character.
- `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively.
- `char` is the first character in `expr`.
- If `char` is a closing bracket, `stack` is a list containing this closing bracket.
- If `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding closing bracket of the current character in `expr` as defined in `matching_pairs`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what changes in the state:
- `expr` still contains parentheses, brackets, or braces but now it must have at least 2 characters because we've already processed the first character.
- `matching_pairs` remains unchanged as it's a constant definition of matching pairs and does not change with each iteration.
- `char` was the first character, so for the next iteration, it will be the second character in `expr`.
- The state of `stack` depends on whether the current character is an opening bracket, a closing bracket, or neither. If it's an opening bracket, it would be pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, its corresponding opening bracket would be expected to be at the top of the stack (and then popped). If it's neither, the stack's state wouldn't change based on this character alone.

Therefore, considering we are at the start of the next iteration:
- `expr` must have at least 2 characters.
- `matching_pairs` remains the same.
- `char` is now the second character in `expr`.
- The condition regarding `stack` and `char` still applies but considering the new `char` (the second character in `expr`), if this new `char` is a closing bracket, `stack` should contain the corresponding opening bracket at its top (not the closing bracket itself as per the previous state description but adjusted for the context of moving to the next character). If `char` is not a closing bracket, the conditions on `stack` and `char` from the previous state description still conceptually apply but are considered in the context of the next character in the sequence.

State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the second character in `expr`, and if `char` is a closing bracket, `stack` should be expected to have its corresponding opening bracket at the top, or if `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding closing bracket of the current character in `expr` as defined in `matching_pairs`**
