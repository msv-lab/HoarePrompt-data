Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' as values and ')', ']', '}' as keys respectively, `char` is the first character in `expr`, and `char` is not a closing bracket, i.e., `char` is not ')', ']', or '}'. If `char` is an opening bracket that has a corresponding closing bracket in `matching_pairs`, then the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding closing bracket of the current character in `expr` as defined in `matching_pairs`, i.e., `stack` is not empty and `stack.pop() == matching_pairs[char]`. Otherwise, `char` is not in `matching_pairs`.***
