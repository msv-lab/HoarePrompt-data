The given code defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. The initial state is that `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, and `stack` is an empty list.

The code only defines a dictionary and does not modify the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `matching_pairs` dictionary.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys ')"', ']'," and '}'" and values '(', '[', and '{' respectively.**
