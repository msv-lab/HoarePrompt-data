Postcondition: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' as values and ')', ']', '}' as keys respectively, `char` is the first character in `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket, i.e., `char` is ')', ']', or '}', then `stack` is a list containing this closing bracket. If `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding closing bracket of the current character in `expr` as defined in `matching_pairs`.**
