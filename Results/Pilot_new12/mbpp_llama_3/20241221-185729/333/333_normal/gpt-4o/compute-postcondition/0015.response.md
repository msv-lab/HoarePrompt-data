Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 2 characters, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively. If `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding opening bracket of `char` as defined in `matching_pairs`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False, with `stack` having its top element removed if it is not empty and matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char`.***
