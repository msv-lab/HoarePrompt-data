The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the end of the `stack`. Given the initial state, `char` is the third character in `expr`, and its value depends on the content of `expr`. If `char` is a closing bracket, the top of `stack` already has the corresponding opening bracket. If `char` is not a closing bracket, then either `char` is not an opening bracket, or `stack` is updated accordingly.

Since `char` is appended to `stack`, the new top of `stack` will be `char`. The states of `expr`, `matching_pairs` are not affected. 

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 1 character, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' and values ')', ']', '}' respectively, `char` is the third character in `expr`, `stack` has `char` at the top. If `char` is a closing bracket, it corresponds to the second last element in `stack`. If `char` is an opening bracket, it is added to `stack`. If `char` is not a bracket, it is added to `stack` as is.**
