Postcondition: **`expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys '(', '[', and '{' as values and ')', ']', '}' as keys respectively, `char` is the first character in `expr`. The current value of `char` is one of the closing brackets, i.e., ')', ']', or '}' since it is a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary.**
