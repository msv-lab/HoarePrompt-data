To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides details about `expr`, `matching_pairs`, `stack`, and `char`. However, the return statement `return stack == []` is what we need to focus on.

The `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets in `expr`. The expression `stack == []` checks if the `stack` is empty, meaning all brackets in `expr` have been properly matched and closed.

Given the details:
- `expr` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces.
- `matching_pairs` is a dictionary with keys ')', ']', and '}' and values '(', '[', and '{' respectively, but it's not used in the return statement.
- `stack` contains the unmatched opening brackets in `expr`.
- `char` is the last character in `expr` if `expr` is not empty, but it's not used in the return statement.

The return statement `return stack == []` will return `True` if the `stack` is empty (indicating all brackets in `expr` are properly matched) and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **The program returns True if all brackets in `expr` are properly matched and closed, False otherwise**
