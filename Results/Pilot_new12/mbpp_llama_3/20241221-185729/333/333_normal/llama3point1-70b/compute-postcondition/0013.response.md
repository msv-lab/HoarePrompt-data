The code appends the second character of the `expression` to the `stack`. The `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least 2 characters. The `brackets` is a dictionary that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. The `char` is the second character in the `expression`.

Given that `char` is the second character in the `expression`, after the code is executed, `stack` will contain this second character. The states of `expression`, `brackets`, and `char` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains the second character of `expression`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains `char`.**
