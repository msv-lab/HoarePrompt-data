The current value of `char` is either ')', '}', or ']', which is a closing bracket. Since `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary, it must be one of the values in the dictionary. The stack is either empty or the last opening bracket in the stack does not match the current closing bracket `char`. 

Output State: **The program returns False, indicating that the parentheses, brackets, or braces in the string `expression` are not balanced.**
