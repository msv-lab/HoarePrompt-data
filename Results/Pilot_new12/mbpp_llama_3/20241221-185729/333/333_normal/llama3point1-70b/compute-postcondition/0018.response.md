According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `expression` must have at least 3 characters and `char` is the third character in the `expression`. The state of `brackets` remains the same. The state of `stack` depends on the value of `char`. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` will contain `char`. If `char` is a closing bracket, the program would have returned False if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket of the second character, so we assume the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches with the closing bracket of the second character, and the top of the stack is popped.

State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 3 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the third character in the `expression`. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` contains `char`. If `char` is a closing bracket, the program assumes the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches with the closing bracket of the second character, and the top of the stack is popped.**
