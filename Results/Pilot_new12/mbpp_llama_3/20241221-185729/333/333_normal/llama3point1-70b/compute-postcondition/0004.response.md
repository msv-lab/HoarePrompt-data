The code `stack.append(char)` appends the current character `char` to the `stack` list. The initial state specifies that `char` is the first character in the `expression` and is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, meaning it is either an opening parenthesis, brace, or bracket.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is a list containing the first character of `expression`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`**
