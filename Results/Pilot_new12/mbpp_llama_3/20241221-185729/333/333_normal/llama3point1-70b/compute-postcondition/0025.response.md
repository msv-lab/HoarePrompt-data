To solve this task, we consider the impact of the given Python code on the program and calculate the result based on the initial state provided.

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces.
- `brackets` is a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets: `{'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}`.
- `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it contains unmatched opening brackets in the order they appear.
- `char` is the last character in `expression`.

The code to execute is:
```python
return not stack
```

This code returns the boolean opposite of whether `stack` is truthy (i.e., not empty) or falsy (i.e., empty). In Python, an empty list (or stack, in this context) is considered falsy, and a non-empty list is considered truthy.

Given that `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched and contains unmatched opening brackets otherwise, the expression `not stack` will evaluate to:
- `True` if `stack` is empty, meaning all brackets in `expression` are matched.
- `False` if `stack` is not empty, meaning there are unmatched opening brackets in `expression`.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in the `expression` string are properly matched.

Output State: **The program returns True if all brackets in `expression` are matched, and False otherwise.**
