Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and `char` is the third character in `expression`. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket of `char`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the top of the stack is popped if it matches with the closing bracket of `char`, maintaining the consistency of the stack with the opening and closing brackets in `expression`.***
