Postcondition: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is a list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`, initially `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary, and the current value of `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, meaning it is either ')', '}', or ']', and either the stack is empty or if it's not empty, the last opening bracket in the stack does not match the current closing bracket `char`, meaning the current value of `brackets[stack.pop()]` is not equal to `char`**
