According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` has at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the `expression`. For the loop to execute again, `expression` must have at least 2 characters. Since `char` is the first character, for the next iteration, `char` will be the second character in the `expression`. 

If the first character is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, then `stack` is a list containing the first character of `expression`, so for the next iteration, the state of the stack needs to be updated based on the second character. If the second character is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, it will be added to the stack. If it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary and the stack is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket, the top of the stack is popped. If none of these conditions are met, the stack remains unchanged.

State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`**
