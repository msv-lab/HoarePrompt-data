Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 2 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If `char` is a closing bracket and the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket of the second character, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution if `char` is a closing bracket, and the program also continues execution if `char` is not a closing bracket.***
