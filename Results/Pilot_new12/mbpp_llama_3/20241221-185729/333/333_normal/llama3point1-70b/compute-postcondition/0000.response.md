The code initializes an empty list `stack`. The initial state mentions that `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, but this does not change. The introduction of `stack` as an empty list is the only change.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list**
