Postcondition: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`. If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, then `stack` is a list containing the first character of `expression`. If `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary, then `stack` is a list, and if `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary and the stack is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, the top of the stack is popped, otherwise no changes are made to the stack.**
