Postcondition: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is a list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`, `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary, and the current value of `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, meaning it is either ')', '}', or ']', the stack is not empty, and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, i.e., `brackets[stack[-1]] == char` or after popping from the stack the top of the stack has a corresponding closing bracket that is equal to the current character, i.e., `brackets[stack.pop()] == char`**
