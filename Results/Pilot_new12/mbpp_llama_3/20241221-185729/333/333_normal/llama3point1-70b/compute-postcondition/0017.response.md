Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` contains `char`. If `char` is a closing bracket, the program returns False if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket of the second character. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
