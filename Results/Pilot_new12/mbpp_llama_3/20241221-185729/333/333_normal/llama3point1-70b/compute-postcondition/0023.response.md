Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and `char` is the third character in `expression`. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` contains `char` as its last element, in addition to any previous elements. If `char` is a closing bracket, the program checks if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches with the closing bracket of `char`. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match, the program returns False. If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches with the closing bracket of `char`, the top of the stack is popped. If `char` is neither an opening nor a closing bracket, no operation related to the stack is performed.***
