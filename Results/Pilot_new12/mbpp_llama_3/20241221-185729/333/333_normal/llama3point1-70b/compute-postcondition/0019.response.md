To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters.
- `brackets` is a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets: `{'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}`.
- `char` is the third character in the `expression`.
- If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` initially contains `char`. If `char` is a closing bracket, it's assumed the stack is not empty and its top matches the closing bracket of the second character, and the top of the stack is popped.

However, the given code snippet simply appends `char` to `stack` without any conditions:
```python
stack.append(char)
```

Given this operation, we can deduce the following:
- Regardless of whether `char` is an opening or closing bracket, it will be appended to `stack`.
- There's no assumption about the stack being empty or not before appending `char`; `char` is simply added to `stack`.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `expression` remains unchanged as it's a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters.
- `brackets` remains unchanged as it's a dictionary mapping opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
- `char` remains the third character in the `expression`, but now it's also the last element added to `stack`.
- `stack` now contains `char` as its last element, in addition to any elements it might have had before (if `char` was an opening bracket, it was already in `stack`, and if `char` was a closing bracket, the top of the stack was assumed to match the closing bracket of the second character before this operation, but this assumption is irrelevant to the effect of `stack.append(char)`).

Thus, the output state, considering all provided information and the effect of appending `char` to `stack`, is:
Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the third character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains `char` as its last element, in addition to any previous elements.**
