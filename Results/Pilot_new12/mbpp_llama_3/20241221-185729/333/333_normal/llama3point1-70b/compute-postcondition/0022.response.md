Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and `char` is the third character in `expression`. If `char` is a closing bracket, the program checks if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches with the closing bracket of `char`. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match, the program returns False. If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches with the closing bracket of `char`, the top of the stack is popped. If `char` is not a closing bracket, the program does not perform any operation related to the stack.***
