The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces. After executing the function body, 
Case_1: If the parentheses, brackets, or braces in the string `expression` are not balanced, the function returns `False`. 
Case_2, Case_3: Since no specific description was provided for these cases and based on the given output, it appears they are not applicable as they return the same value as Case_1 without additional conditions.
Case_4: The function returns `True` if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, it returns `False`. Given that Case_1 seems to cover the condition of unbalanced brackets and Case_4 directly addresses the matching of brackets, it seems Case_4 encompasses the primary functionality when the brackets are balanced, and Case_1 handles the imbalance, making Case_2 and Case_3 redundant or not applicable based on the given information.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and return `True` if all brackets are matched (balanced); otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and returns `True` if all brackets are matched; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
