Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and checks if all brackets are matched. It returns `True` if the brackets are balanced and `False` otherwise. The function handles cases where the input string contains unmatched opening or closing brackets, and it correctly identifies the balance status of the brackets. If the input string is empty or contains no brackets, the function also returns `True` because there are no unmatched brackets. Additionally, the function is case-sensitive and considers only the specific bracket characters defined in the `brackets` dictionary. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it will fail if the input is not a string. Overall, the function provides a simple and effective way to validate the balance of brackets in a given string expression.**
