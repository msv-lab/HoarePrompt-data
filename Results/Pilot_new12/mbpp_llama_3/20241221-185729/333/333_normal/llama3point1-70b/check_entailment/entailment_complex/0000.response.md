Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function to check if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the expression. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered or if the top of the stack does not contain the corresponding opening bracket, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.

After iterating through the entire expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

This implementation meets the problem description for every potential case, including:

* Empty strings or strings with no brackets, which are considered balanced.
* Strings with matched brackets, which are considered balanced.
* Strings with unmatched opening or closing brackets, which are considered unbalanced.
* Strings with nested brackets, which are correctly handled by the stack data structure.

The program assumes that the input will be a valid string, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. Overall, the program provides a simple and effective way to validate the balance of brackets in a given string expression.
