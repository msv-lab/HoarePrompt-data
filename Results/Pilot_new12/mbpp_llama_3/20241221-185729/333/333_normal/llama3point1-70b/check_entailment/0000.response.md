Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the corresponding closing brackets are in the correct order.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty stack and a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
2. It iterates over each character in the expression. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it pushes the character onto the stack.
3. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not correspond to the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
4. After iterating over all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, it means there are unbalanced opening brackets, so it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Balanced expressions: `func_1("({[]})")` returns `True`
* Unbalanced expressions: `func_1("({[})")` returns `False`
* Empty expressions: `func_1("")` returns `True`
* Expressions with only opening brackets: `func_1("({[")` returns `False`
* Expressions with only closing brackets: `func_1(")}]")` returns `False`

I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
