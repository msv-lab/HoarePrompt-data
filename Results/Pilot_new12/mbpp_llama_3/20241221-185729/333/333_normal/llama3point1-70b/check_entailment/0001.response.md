Correctness: **True**

The given program checks if a given expression is balanced or not by using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and comparing them with the closing brackets. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It initializes an empty stack to store the opening brackets.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
3. It iterates over each character in the expression. If the character is an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns False, indicating that the expression is not balanced.
5. After iterating over the entire expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the expression is balanced, and the function returns True. If the stack is not empty, the expression is not balanced, and the function returns False.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Empty expressions
- Expressions with single opening or closing brackets
- Expressions with matching opening and closing brackets
- Expressions with mismatched opening and closing brackets
- Expressions with nested brackets

It also handles edge cases such as expressions with characters that are not brackets.

Overall, the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
