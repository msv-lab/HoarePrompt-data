You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the corresponding closing brackets are in the correct order.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty stack and a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.
2. It iterates over each character in the expression. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it pushes the character onto the stack.
3. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not correspond to the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
4. After iterating over all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, it means there are unbalanced opening brackets, so it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Balanced expressions: `func_1("({[]})")` returns `True`
* Unbalanced expressions: `func_1("({[})")` returns `False`
* Empty expressions: `func_1("")` returns `True`
* Expressions with only opening brackets: `func_1("({[")` returns `False`
* Expressions with only closing brackets: `func_1(")}]")` returns `False`

I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched, otherwise it contains unmatched opening brackets in the order they appear, and `char` is the last character in `expression`.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if all brackets in `expression` are matched, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and checks if all brackets are matched. It returns `True` if the brackets are balanced and `False` otherwise. The function handles cases where the input string contains unmatched opening or closing brackets, and it correctly identifies the balance status of the brackets. If the input string is empty or contains no brackets, the function also returns `True` because there are no unmatched brackets. Additionally, the function is case-sensitive and considers only the specific bracket characters defined in the `brackets` dictionary. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it will fail if the input is not a string. Overall, the function provides a simple and effective way to validate the balance of brackets in a given string expression.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
