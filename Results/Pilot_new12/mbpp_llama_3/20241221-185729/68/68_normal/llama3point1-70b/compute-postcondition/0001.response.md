To calculate the output state, we need to understand what `cmath.phase(complex_num)` does. This function returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `complex_num` in radians.

Given that `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`, where `real` and `imag` are real numbers, we can calculate the phase using the formula for the phase of a complex number: `phase = atan2(imag, real)`.

The `atan2` function returns the arc tangent of `imag/real` in radians. The range of `atan2` is `-pi` to `pi`, which covers all possible angles for a complex number.

Since `real` and `imag` are real numbers and `complex_num` is equal to `real + imag*1j`, we know that `complex_num` represents a point in the complex plane with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.

The program returns the phase of `complex_num`. The phase is an angle in radians, calculated using the `atan2` function with `imag` and `real` as arguments. 

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num`, which is calculated as atan2(imag, real)**
