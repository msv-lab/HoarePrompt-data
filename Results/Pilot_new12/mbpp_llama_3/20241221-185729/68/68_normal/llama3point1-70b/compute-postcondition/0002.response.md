The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both of which are real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number calculated using `real` and `imag`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, and return the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, real and imag, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number.**
