The code creates a complex number `complex_num` using the `complex` function with `real` and `imag` as its real and imaginary parts, respectively. The values of `real` and `imag` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`**
