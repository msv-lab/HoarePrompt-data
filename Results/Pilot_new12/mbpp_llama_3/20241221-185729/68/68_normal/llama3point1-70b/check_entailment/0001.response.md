Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle (in radians) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The `cmath.phase` function is used, which is the standard way to calculate the angle of a complex number in Python.

The `cmath.phase` function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Complex numbers with positive or negative real and imaginary parts.
- Complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part.
- Complex numbers with very large or very small magnitudes.
- Complex numbers close to the positive or negative real axis.

The function returns the angle in radians, which is consistent with the expected output for an angle calculation.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the provided program is correct and should produce the expected results for all possible inputs.
