Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which handles edge cases such as division by zero when `real` is zero. The function provides a result in the range (-π, π], consistent with the mathematical definition of the phase of a complex number. 

The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns a single value representing the phase of the complex number formed by these parameters. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`.

The output hints suggest that the function handles all possible combinations of real and imaginary inputs, including zero values for either or both, and provides a result consistent with the mathematical definition of the phase of a complex number. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a real number or where the input values cause division by zero. However, `cmath.phase` function automatically handles such cases.

Therefore, we can conclude that the function works as expected for every potential case and is correct.
