Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided function, `func_1`, takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number formed by these parameters.

The function uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase of the complex number, which is equivalent to calculating the angle using the `atan2` function. This handles edge cases such as division by zero when `real` is zero, and provides a result in the range (-π, π].

The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, and only returns a single value representing the phase of the complex number. The function handles all possible combinations of real and imaginary inputs, including zero values for either or both, and provides a result consistent with the mathematical definition of the phase of a complex number.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is invalid. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
