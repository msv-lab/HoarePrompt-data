You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import cmath

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num`, which is calculated as atan2(imag, real)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number formed by these parameters. The phase is calculated as atan2(imag, real), which handles edge cases such as division by zero when `real` is zero, and provides a result in the range (-π, π]. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, and only returns a single value representing the phase of the complex number. The function handles all possible combinations of real and imaginary inputs, including zero values for either or both, and provides a result consistent with the mathematical definition of the phase of a complex number.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
