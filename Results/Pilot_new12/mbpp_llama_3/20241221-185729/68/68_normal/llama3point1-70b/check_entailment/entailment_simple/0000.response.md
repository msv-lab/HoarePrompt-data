Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to get the angle of a complex number. 

The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these parts and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. 

The `cmath.phase` function calculates the phase (angle in radians) of a complex number as atan2(imag, real), which is the correct mathematical formula to calculate the angle of a complex number. 

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description. 

For any valid input of real and imaginary parts, the program will return the correct angle of the corresponding complex number, making it correct according to the given problem description.
