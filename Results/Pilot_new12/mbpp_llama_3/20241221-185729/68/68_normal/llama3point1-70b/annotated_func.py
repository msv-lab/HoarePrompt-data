#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num`, which is calculated as atan2(imag, real)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number formed by these parameters. The phase is calculated as atan2(imag, real), which handles edge cases such as division by zero when `real` is zero, and provides a result in the range (-π, π]. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, and only returns a single value representing the phase of the complex number. The function handles all possible combinations of real and imaginary inputs, including zero values for either or both, and provides a result consistent with the mathematical definition of the phase of a complex number.
