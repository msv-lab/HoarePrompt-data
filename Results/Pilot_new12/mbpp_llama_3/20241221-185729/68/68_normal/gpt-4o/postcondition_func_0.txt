The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both real numbers, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians. It effectively calculates the arctangent of `imag` over `real` and returns this value. The function handles the general case of calculating the phase for any given complex number represented by `real` and `imag` components. It does not explicitly handle edge cases such as division by zero (when `real` is zero), which would occur if `imag` is non-zero, as the `cmath.phase` function in Python naturally handles such cases by returning the appropriate phase value in radians, specifically π/2 for positive `imag` and -π/2 for negative `imag` when `real` is zero. For the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, the `cmath.phase` function returns 0. The final state of the program is that it concludes by returning a single value representing the phase of the complex number in radians.
