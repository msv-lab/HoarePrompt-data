Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided function `func_1` takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, as input and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians.

The function uses the `cmath.phase` function, which returns the phase (angle) of a complex number, determined by the arctangent of the imaginary part over the real part. The `cmath.phase` function handles the different cases where the real part is zero or negative, ensuring that the returned angle is in the correct quadrant.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different inputs, including cases where the real or imaginary part is zero. The use of `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance also accounts for potential floating-point precision issues.

Since the function correctly computes and returns the angle of a complex number for all valid inputs, and given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
