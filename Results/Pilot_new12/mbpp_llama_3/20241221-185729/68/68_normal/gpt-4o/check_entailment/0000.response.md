Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to calculate the angle of a complex number. It uses the `cmath.phase` function from Python's standard library, which returns the phase (angle) of a complex number in radians. The function takes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as input, creates a complex number using these parts, and then returns its phase.

The unit tests provided also suggest that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The function correctly handles cases where the real part is zero (which corresponds to an angle of π/2) and cases where the imaginary part is zero (which would correspond to an angle of 0 or π, depending on the sign of the real part, but this is not tested in the provided assertions).

One potential edge case to consider is when the complex number is zero (i.e., both real and imaginary parts are zero), because the phase of zero is undefined in mathematics. However, `cmath.phase` handles this case by returning `0`, following the convention used in many numerical and engineering contexts where a consistent (though mathematically arbitrary) value is needed.

Given the provided information and assuming `cmath.phase` behaves as documented for all complex numbers, including those with zero real and/or imaginary parts, the function appears to correctly calculate the angle of any given complex number. Therefore, without identifying a specific case where the function does not work as expected, the correctness can be considered true.
