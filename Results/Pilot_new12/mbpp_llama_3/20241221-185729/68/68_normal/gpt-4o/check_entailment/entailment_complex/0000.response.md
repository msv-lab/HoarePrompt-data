Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are used to create a complex number. The function then returns the phase (angle) of this complex number in radians using the `cmath.phase` function. 

The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, which is exactly what the `func_1` function does. It correctly handles the case where `real` is zero, where `cmath.phase` returns the appropriate phase value (π/2 for positive `imag` and -π/2 for negative `imag`).

The provided assertions also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a real number.

The `cmath.phase` function handles the edge cases, such as division by zero, correctly. For the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, the `cmath.phase` function returns 0, which is the expected result.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
