Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both real numbers, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians. The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the `cmath.phase` function, including its handling of edge cases such as division by zero when `real` is zero.

The original assessment correctly notes that the program handles complex numbers with zero real part (i.e., purely imaginary numbers) and complex numbers with non-zero real part, and that the `cmath.phase` function returns the correct angle in radians for these cases.

Furthermore, the annotated version of the code explicitly mentions that the `cmath.phase` function naturally handles edge cases, such as division by zero, by returning the appropriate phase value in radians. This confirms that the program does not need to explicitly handle these cases, and that the `cmath.phase` function provides the correct behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the annotated version of the code, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
