Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided effectively calculates the phase (angle) of a complex number represented by the `real` and `imag` components using the `cmath.phase` function. The `cmath.phase` function handles edge cases such as when `real` is zero (returning π/2 for positive `imag` and -π/2 for negative `imag`) and when both `real` and `imag` are zero (returning 0). The function operates within the problem description, accepting two parameters and returning the phase of the complex number in radians. 

The provided unit tests (assert statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including when the real part is non-zero and when the imaginary part is non-zero. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and given that the `cmath.phase` function handles edge cases correctly, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
