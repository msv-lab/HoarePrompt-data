Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate the phase (or angle) of the complex number, which is the correct approach.

The `cmath.phase` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The unit tests provided also seem to be correct and cover different cases.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. The program correctly handles complex numbers with zero real part (i.e., purely imaginary numbers) and complex numbers with non-zero real part.

For example, `func_1(0, 1j)` returns approximately 1.5707963267948966, which is the correct angle in radians for the complex number `1j`. Similarly, `func_1(2, 1j)` returns approximately 0.4636476090008061, which is also correct.

In conclusion, the provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
