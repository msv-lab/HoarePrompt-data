You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate the phase (or angle) of the complex number, which is the correct approach.

The `cmath.phase` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The unit tests provided also seem to be correct and cover different cases.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. The program correctly handles complex numbers with zero real part (i.e., purely imaginary numbers) and complex numbers with non-zero real part.

For example, `func_1(0, 1j)` returns approximately 1.5707963267948966, which is the correct angle in radians for the complex number `1j`. Similarly, `func_1(2, 1j)` returns approximately 0.4636476090008061, which is also correct.

In conclusion, the provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both real numbers, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians. It effectively calculates the arctangent of `imag` over `real` and returns this value. The function handles the general case of calculating the phase for any given complex number represented by `real` and `imag` components. It does not explicitly handle edge cases such as division by zero (when `real` is zero), which would occur if `imag` is non-zero, as the `cmath.phase` function in Python naturally handles such cases by returning the appropriate phase value in radians, specifically π/2 for positive `imag` and -π/2 for negative `imag` when `real` is zero. For the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, the `cmath.phase` function returns 0. The final state of the program is that it concludes by returning a single value representing the phase of the complex number in radians.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
