The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both of which are real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two real numbers `real` and `imag` and return the phase (angle) of the corresponding complex number in radians.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, real and imag, both real numbers, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians.**
