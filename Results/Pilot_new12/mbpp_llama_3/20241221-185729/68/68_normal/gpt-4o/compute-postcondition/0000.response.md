The code creates a complex number `complex_number` with `real` as the real part and `imag` as the imaginary part. 

`complex_number` is assigned the value of a complex number where the real part is `real` and the imaginary part is `imag`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`real` and `imag` are real numbers, `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag`j**
