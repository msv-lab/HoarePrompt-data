To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what `cmath.phase(complex_number)` does. This function returns the phase (angle) of the complex number in radians.

Given that `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag`j, where `real` and `imag` are real numbers, the phase of `complex_number` can be calculated using the formula `atan2(imag, real)`, which is essentially what `cmath.phase()` does.

Therefore, the program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians. This phase is determined by the values of `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers.

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag`j in radians, which is determined by the arctangent of `imag` over `real`.**
