Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program starts with a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
2. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of the number.
3. This last digit is added to the `total`, which is initialized to 0.
4. The number `n` is then divided by 10 (integer division `//=`), effectively removing the last digit.
5. Steps 2-4 repeat until `n` is 0, at which point all digits have been processed.
6. The final `total` is returned, which is the sum of all the digits of the original number.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. 

For example, for the input `345`, the function correctly calculates the sum of the digits as `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`. 

The function handles non-negative integers and correctly calculates the sum of their digits, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements.
