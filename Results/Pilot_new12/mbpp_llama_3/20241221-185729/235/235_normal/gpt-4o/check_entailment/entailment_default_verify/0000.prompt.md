You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
2. The function enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of the number.
4. The function adds this digit to the `total`.
5. The function then performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`), effectively removing the last digit from the number.
6. Steps 3-5 repeat until `n` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the `total`, which is the sum of all the digits.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for specific inputs.

Since the code correctly handles the case where the input is 0 (the while loop simply doesn't execute, and the function returns 0, which is the correct result) and all other non-negative integer cases, and there are no edge cases that the code does not handle, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all its digits. The return value can be any non-negative integer, not necessarily 0, as the annotated code and return postconditions suggest. The function handles all non-negative integers, including 0, and correctly calculates the sum of their digits. After execution, the function's state is concluded, and it returns the calculated sum, which is the total of all digits of the original input value `n`. The function does not modify the input variable `n` outside of its local scope. It only returns the calculated sum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
