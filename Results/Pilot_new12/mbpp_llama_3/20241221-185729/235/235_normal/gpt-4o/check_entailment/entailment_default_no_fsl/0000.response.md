Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code is a function named `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a given non-negative integer `n`. The function uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number, adding it to a running total. This process continues until all digits have been processed, at which point the function returns the total sum of the digits.

The code correctly handles all non-negative integers, including 0, and accurately calculates the sum of their digits. For example, given the input `345`, the function correctly returns `12` (3 + 4 + 5), and for the input `12`, it correctly returns `3` (1 + 2).

The function also handles the case when the input is `0`, although there is no explicit test case for this in the provided code. In this case, the while loop will not execute, and the function will return `0`, which is the expected result.

Since the program description does not specify any invalid inputs, and the code handles all valid non-negative integers correctly, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case. The output hints also agree with the code and provide additional examples of the function's correctness.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given non-negative integer, and its correctness is verified.
