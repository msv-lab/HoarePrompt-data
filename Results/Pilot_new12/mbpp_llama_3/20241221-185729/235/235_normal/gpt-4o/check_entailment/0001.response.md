Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over each digit of the input number `n`. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` (`n % 10`) to the `total` and then removes the last digit from `n` (`n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed and the `total` contains the sum of the digits.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm the correctness of the program for specific input cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles non-negative integers correctly, and the while loop ensures that all digits are processed. The use of integer division (`//=`) and modulo operations (`%`) ensures that the program works correctly for all non-negative integers.
