Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits of `n`.
2. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 using the modulo operator (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of `n`. This digit is added to `total`.
4. The function then performs integer division of `n` by 10 using the floor division operator (`n //= 10`), which effectively removes the last digit of `n`.
5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits of the original value of `n` have been processed and added to `total`.
6. Finally, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`.

The program handles all non-negative integers, including 0, correctly. When `n` is 0, the while loop is not executed, and the function returns 0, which is the correct sum of the digits of 0.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various inputs. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
