Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
2. The function enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. Inside the loop, the function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of the number.
4. The function adds this digit to the `total`.
5. The function then performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`), effectively removing the last digit from the number.
6. Steps 3-5 repeat until `n` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the `total`, which is the sum of all the digits.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for specific inputs.

Since the code correctly handles the case where the input is 0 (the while loop simply doesn't execute, and the function returns 0, which is the correct result) and all other non-negative integer cases, and there are no edge cases that the code does not handle, the program is correct.
