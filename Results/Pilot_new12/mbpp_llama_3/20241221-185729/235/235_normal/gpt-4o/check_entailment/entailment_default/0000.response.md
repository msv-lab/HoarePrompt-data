Correctness: **True**

The provided code calculates the sum of digits of a non-negative integer correctly. It uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the input number `n` by taking the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`) and adding it to the total sum. After processing each digit, it removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function handles all non-negative integers and correctly calculates the sum of their digits. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function.

Since the code handles all non-negative integers and calculates the sum of their digits as described in the problem, and there are no cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is True.
