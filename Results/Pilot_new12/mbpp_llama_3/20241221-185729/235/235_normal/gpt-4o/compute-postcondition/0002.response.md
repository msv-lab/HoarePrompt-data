The code `total += n % 10` updates the value of `total` by adding the remainder of `n` divided by 10 to it. The remainder of `n` divided by 10 is the last digit of `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the last digit of `n` can be any integer from 1 to 9. 

The initial value of `total` is 0. After executing the code, `total` becomes 0 + (the last digit of `n`), which is equal to the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is equal to the last digit of `n`**
