Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all its digits. The return value can be any non-negative integer, not necessarily 0, as the annotated code and return postconditions suggest. The function handles all non-negative integers, including 0, and correctly calculates the sum of their digits. After execution, the function's state is concluded, and it returns the calculated sum, which is the total of all digits of the original input value `n`. The function does not modify the input variable `n` outside of its local scope. It only returns the calculated sum.**
