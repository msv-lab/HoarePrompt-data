According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 without its last digit. This implies that the last digit was removed from `n` in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 0 after the last digit was removed. Since `n` is now without its last digit and is greater than 0, it means the original `n` had at least two digits and the part without the last digit is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0 without its last digit, `total` is the last digit of the original value of `n`**
