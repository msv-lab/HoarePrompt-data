To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information.

The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained by `n % 10`) to `total` and then removes the last digit from `n` (achieved by `n //= 10`).

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` is gradually reduced by removing its last digit in each iteration until it becomes 0.
- `total` accumulates the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`.

Considering these patterns, the loop will execute until `n` becomes 0, at which point it will have processed all digits of the original value of `n`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
- `n` will be 0 because the loop continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0.
- `total` will be the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`, since in each iteration, the last digit of `n` is added to `total` before being removed from `n`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`**
