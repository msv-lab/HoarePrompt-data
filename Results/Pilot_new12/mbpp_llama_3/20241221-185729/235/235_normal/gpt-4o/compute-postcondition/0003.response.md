The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `total` is equal to the last digit of `n`, after the code is executed, `n` will be updated to be the value of `n` without its last digit.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 without its last digit, `total` is the last digit of the original value of `n`**
