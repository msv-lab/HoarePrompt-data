To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while n > 0:`, which means the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the original value of `n` without its last digit.
- `total` is the last digit of the original value of `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` (which is now without its last digit) must still be greater than 0. This implies that the original value of `n` must have had at least two digits, because after removing the last digit, `n` should still be greater than 0.

Given that `total` is the last digit of the original value of `n`, and `n` is now without this last digit, `n` being greater than 0 means the original `n` had more than one digit. The state of `total` does not affect the loop condition directly, as it only depends on `n`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is that `n`, after losing its last digit, must still be greater than 0. This means the original value of `n` should have been at least a two-digit number, ensuring that after removing one digit, `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` is the original value of `n` without its last digit and must be greater than 0, `total` is the last digit of the original value of `n`**
