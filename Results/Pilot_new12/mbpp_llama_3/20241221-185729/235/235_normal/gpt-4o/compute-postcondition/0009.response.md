The given code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is the original value of `n` without its last digit and is greater than 0, and `total` is twice the last digit of the original value of `n`, let's denote the original value of `n` as `original_n`. 

Then, `n` without its last digit is `original_n // 10`, and the last digit of `original_n` is `original_n % 10`. 

Therefore, `total` is `2 * (original_n % 10)`, and `n` is `original_n // 10`.

After the code `n //= 10` is executed, `n` becomes `(original_n // 10) // 10`, which simplifies to `original_n // 100`.

The value of `total` is not affected by the code.

So, the Output State is: `n` is the original value of `n` without its last two digits, `total` is twice the last digit of the original value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is `original_n // 100`, `total` is `2 * (original_n % 10)`**
