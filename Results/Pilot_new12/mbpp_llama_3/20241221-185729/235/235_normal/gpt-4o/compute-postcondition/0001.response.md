To ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to examine the condition that governs the loop's execution, which is `n > 0`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends solely on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is described as a non-negative integer, which means `n` could be 0, making the loop condition false and preventing the loop from executing. 

For the loop to execute at least one time, `n` needs to be adjusted so that it is greater than 0. The state of `total` being 0 does not affect the loop's condition and therefore does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
