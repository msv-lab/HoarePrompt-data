The code `n //= 10` removes the last digit of the number `n`. In the initial state, `n` is greater than 0 without its last digit, and `total` is still the last digit of the original value of `n`.

After executing the code, `n` will become the original value of `n` without its last digit, which is equal to the current value of `n`. The value of `total` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n` without its last digit, `total` is the last digit of the original value of `n`**
