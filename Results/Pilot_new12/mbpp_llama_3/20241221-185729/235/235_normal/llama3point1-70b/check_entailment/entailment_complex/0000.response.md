Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. **Conversion to String**: The program converts the non-negative integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`. This allows for easy iteration over each digit of the number.

2. **Iteration and Summation**: The program uses a generator expression to iterate over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`. It converts each character back to an integer with `int(digit)` and sums all these integers using the built-in `sum` function. This effectively calculates the sum of the digits of the original number.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as single-digit numbers or zero, its logic is robust enough to correctly handle these scenarios without additional checks. For single-digit numbers, the loop will simply operate on a single character, returning that number itself. For zero, the loop will operate on '0', correctly returning 0.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As per the problem statement, we assume the input will always be a valid non-negative integer. Therefore, we do not need to consider error handling for invalid inputs such as negative numbers or non-integers.

5. **No Side Effects**: The function does not modify the input `n` or have any side effects on external state, aligning with the annotation's description of the function's behavior.

In conclusion, the program correctly computes the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer `n` without requiring explicit error checking for the cases of single-digit numbers or zero, given the assumption of valid input.
