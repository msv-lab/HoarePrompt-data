The original assessment correctly determines that the provided program meets the problem description. The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and accurately returns the sum of its digits. The function works correctly for single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and the edge case where `n` is 0.

The output hints confirm this analysis by stating that the function handles single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and the case where `n` is 0 correctly. They also clarify that the function does not perform error checking on the input, assuming it to be a non-negative integer.

The reasoning behind the original assessment emphasizes that the function correctly calculates the sum of digits for all non-negative integers, handling all cases as expected. Given that the problem description specifies the task of writing a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer and assuming valid input, the function `func_1(n)` meets these requirements.

Therefore, based on the program, the output hints, and the problem description, there is no evidence to contradict the original assessment. The function is designed to operate within the constraints of non-negative integers, and its operation aligns with the expected behavior for such inputs.

Final: **True**
