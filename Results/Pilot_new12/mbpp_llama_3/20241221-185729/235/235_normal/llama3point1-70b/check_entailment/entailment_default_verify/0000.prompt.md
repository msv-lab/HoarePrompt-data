You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
- It converts the integer into a string using `str(n)`.
- It then uses a generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` to iterate over each character (digit) in the string, convert it back to an integer with `int(digit)`, and yield it.
- Finally, it uses the built-in `sum` function to add up all the digits.

This approach correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer. It works for single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and even for the number 0, because the sum of the digits of 0 is 0.

For example, if you input `123`, the function will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. If you input `100`, it will return `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`. If you input `0`, it will return `0`.

Since the function handles all non-negative integers correctly and there are no edge cases where it would fail to calculate the sum of digits as expected, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. This includes handling single-digit numbers (where the sum is the number itself), multi-digit numbers, and the edge case where `n` is 0 (in which case the sum is 0). The function does not modify the input `n` and does not perform any error checking, so it assumes that `n` will always be a non-negative integer. If `n` were negative or not an integer, the function's behavior would be based solely on the conversion and summation operations as implemented in the code, without any additional error handling. The final state of the program after the function concludes is the return value, which is the sum of the digits of the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
