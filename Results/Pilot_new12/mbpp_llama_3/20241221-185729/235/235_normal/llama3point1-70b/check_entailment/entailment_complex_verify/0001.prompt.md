You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It converts the integer to a string using `str(n)`, allowing it to iterate over each digit.
3. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each character (digit) in the string, converts it back to an integer using `int(digit)`, and sums up all the digits using the built-in `sum` function.
4. The function returns the sum of the digits.

This approach works correctly for all non-negative integers, including zero. For example:

- `func_1(123)` returns `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
- `func_1(456)` returns `4 + 5 + 6 = 15`
- `func_1(0)` returns `0`

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like zero, and follows the problem description without any deviation, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. This includes handling single-digit numbers (where the sum is the number itself), multi-digit numbers, and the edge case where `n` is 0 (in which case the sum is 0). The function does not modify the input `n` and does not perform any error checking, so it assumes that `n` will always be a non-negative integer. If `n` were negative or not an integer, the function's behavior would be based solely on the conversion and summation operations as implemented in the code, without any additional error handling. The final state of the program after the function concludes is the return value, which is the sum of the digits of the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
