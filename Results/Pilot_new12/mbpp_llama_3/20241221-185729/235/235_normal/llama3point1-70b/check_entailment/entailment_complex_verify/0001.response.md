The original assessment claims that the program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Upon analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I find that the original assessment is accurate.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the program's behavior and confirms that it correctly handles the calculation of the sum of digits for non-negative integers. The key points that support this conclusion are:

1. The function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and converts it to a string to iterate over its digits.
2. It uses a generator expression to convert each character (digit) back to an integer and sums them up using the built-in `sum` function.
3. The function returns the sum of the digits without modifying the input or causing any side effects.

The annotated version also highlights that the function assumes the input will always be a non-negative integer and does not perform any error checking. However, based on the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Final: **True**
