Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. The function works by converting the integer into a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back into an integer, and summing them up. 

This approach correctly handles single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and the edge case where `n` is 0. For a single-digit number, the function will simply return the number itself since it's the only digit. For multi-digit numbers, it sums up all the digits. For `n = 0`, it returns 0 because the sum of the digits of 0 is 0.

Given that we assume the input will always be a valid non-negative integer, the function does not need to include error checking for negative numbers or non-integer inputs, and it does not modify the input `n` or have any side effects.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case of valid input, making it correct according to the given constraints.
