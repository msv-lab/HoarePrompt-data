Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. The function works by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and summing them up. 

Given the assumption that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer, the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the sum of digits for single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and the edge case where `n` is 0. Since the input is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer, the lack of error checking does not affect the correctness of the function for the specified input domain. 

For example, if `n = 123`, the function converts `n` to the string `"123"`, then iterates over each character, converting them back to integers and summing them up: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. For `n = 0`, the string is `"0"`, and the sum is `0`. For single-digit numbers like `n = 5`, the string is `"5"`, and the sum is `5`. 

Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs and correctly implements the required functionality.
