Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and sums them up.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Type**: The problem description states that the function should accept a non-negative integer. The program assumes the input will be valid, as specified in the guidelines.

2. **Functionality**: The function is supposed to return the sum of the digits of the input integer. The line `return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` does exactly that:
   - `str(n)` converts the integer `n` into a string, allowing iteration over its digits.
   - `for digit in str(n)` iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`.
   - `int(digit)` converts each character (digit) back into an integer, preparing it for summation.
   - `sum(...)` calculates the sum of these integer digits.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-negative integer), the program does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs (like negative numbers or non-integer values). It handles the edge case where `n` is 0 correctly, as `sum(int(digit) for digit in str(0))` will return 0, which is the expected result.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, making it correct according to the provided guidelines.
