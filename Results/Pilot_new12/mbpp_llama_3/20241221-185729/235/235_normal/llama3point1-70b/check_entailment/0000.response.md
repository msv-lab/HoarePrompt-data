Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
- It converts the integer into a string using `str(n)`.
- It then uses a generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` to iterate over each character (digit) in the string, convert it back to an integer with `int(digit)`, and yield it.
- Finally, it uses the built-in `sum` function to add up all the digits.

This approach correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer. It works for single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and even for the number 0, because the sum of the digits of 0 is 0.

For example, if you input `123`, the function will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. If you input `100`, it will return `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`. If you input `0`, it will return `0`.

Since the function handles all non-negative integers correctly and there are no edge cases where it would fail to calculate the sum of digits as expected, the program is correct.
