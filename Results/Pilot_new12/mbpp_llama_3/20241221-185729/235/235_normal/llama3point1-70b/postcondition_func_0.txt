The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. This includes handling single-digit numbers (where the sum is the number itself), multi-digit numbers, and the edge case where `n` is 0 (in which case the sum is 0). The function does not modify the input `n` and does not perform any error checking, so it assumes that `n` will always be a non-negative integer. If `n` were negative or not an integer, the function's behavior would be based solely on the conversion and summation operations as implemented in the code, without any additional error handling. The final state of the program after the function concludes is the return value, which is the sum of the digits of the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.
