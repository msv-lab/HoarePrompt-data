To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code. The code converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back into an integer, and sums them up.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the possible values of `n` range from 0 to infinity. 

When `n` is 0, the sum of its digits is 0. 
For any other non-negative integer, the sum of its digits will be a positive integer, since we're adding up the individual digits of the number.

Therefore, the program returns the sum of the digits of `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.**
