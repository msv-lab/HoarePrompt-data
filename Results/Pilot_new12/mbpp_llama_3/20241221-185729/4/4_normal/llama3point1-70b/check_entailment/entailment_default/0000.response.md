Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function `func_1(num1, num2)` uses the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) to compare the bits of `num1` and `num2`. The result of this operation will have a '1' bit in each position where the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` are different.

The `bin()` function converts the result of the XOR operation to a binary string, and the `count('1')` method counts the number of '1' bits in this string. If the count is exactly 1, it means that `num1` and `num2` differ at one bit position only, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The output hints agree with the code, describing the function's behavior accurately. They also mention that the function effectively identifies if the difference between `num1` and `num2` (in terms of bits set) is limited to exactly one bit being different, which is the correct interpretation of the function's behavior.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where `num1` and `num2` are the same (in which case the XOR operation results in 0, and the function returns `False`), as well as cases where `num1` and `num2` differ at more than one bit position (in which case the count of '1' bits will be greater than 1, and the function returns `False`). 

Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
