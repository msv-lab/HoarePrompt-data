Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program indeed does what the problem description asks for. It checks whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`.
2. It uses the XOR operator (`^`) to compute the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operation sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in `num1` and `num2` are different.
3. It converts the result of the XOR operation to a binary string using the `bin` function.
4. It counts the number of '1' bits in the binary string using the `count` method.
5. It returns `True` if the count of '1' bits is exactly 1, and `False` otherwise.

This logic is correct because:

* If two numbers differ at one bit position only, their XOR will have exactly one '1' bit.
* If two numbers differ at more than one bit position, their XOR will have more than one '1' bit.
* If two numbers are the same, their XOR will have no '1' bits (resulting in `False` being returned, as per the problem description).

For example, if we call `func_1(4, 5)`, the XOR of 4 and 5 is 1 (which is 001 in binary), so the function will return `True`. On the other hand, if we call `func_1(4, 6)`, the XOR of 4 and 6 is 2 (which is 010 in binary), so the function will return `True` as well. However, if we call `func_1(4, 7)`, the XOR of 4 and 7 is 3 (which is 011 in binary), so the function will return `False` because the XOR has more than one '1' bit.

In summary, the program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not, as specified in the problem description.
