Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(num1, num2)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. Here's why:

1. The function uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to find the bits that are different between `num1` and `num2`. The XOR operator returns `1` for each bit position where the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different.

2. The `bin()` function converts the result of the XOR operation to a binary string. This allows us to count the number of `1`s in the binary representation.

3. The `count('1')` method counts the number of `1`s in the binary string. If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR operation will result in a binary string with exactly one `1`.

4. The function returns `True` if the count of `1`s is `1`, indicating that the two numbers differ at one bit position only, and `False` otherwise.

This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the two numbers are equal (in which case the XOR operation will result in a binary string with no `1`s).
* When the two numbers differ at one or more bit positions (in which case the XOR operation will result in a binary string with one or more `1`s).
* When the two numbers are negative (in which case the XOR operation will still work correctly, since Python's bitwise operators work with the two's complement representation of negative numbers).

Since the function correctly handles all possible cases, and no edge cases or missing logic were found, the program is correct.
