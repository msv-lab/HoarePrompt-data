Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` accurately checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. It achieves this by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the two input numbers, `num1` and `num2`, and then checking if the binary representation of the result contains exactly one '1' bit.

The XOR operation (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0. This means that if `num1` and `num2` differ at only one bit position, their XOR will have exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation.

The `bin()` function is used to convert the result of the XOR operation to a binary string, and the `count('1')` method counts the number of '1' bits in this binary representation. If this count is equal to 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num1` and `num2` differ at one bit position only.

The output hints further clarify this behavior, explaining that the function effectively checks if the difference between `num1` and `num2` is limited to exactly one bit being different. They also provide the important detail that when `num1` equals `num2`, the function will return `False`, as the XOR of a number with itself is 0, which has no '1' bits.

Given the problem description and the functionality of the provided code, it appears that `func_1` correctly handles all potential cases as specified. It accurately determines whether two input numbers differ by exactly one bit, covering both cases where the numbers are different and where they are the same (in which case it correctly returns `False` because no bits are different). Therefore, the code matches the requirements described in the problem statement, and there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected.
