The function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only by performing a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) on the two numbers and then counting the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the result. 

The XOR operation (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, their XOR will have exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation.

Therefore, the function correctly checks whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only.

Correctness: **True**
