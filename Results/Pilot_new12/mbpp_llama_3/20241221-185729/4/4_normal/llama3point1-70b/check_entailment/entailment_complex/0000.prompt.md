You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns a boolean value (True or False) indicating whether the XOR of two integers `num1` and `num2` has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the bitwise XOR operation between `num1` and `num2` results in a binary representation with exactly one '1' bit. This means the function checks if the XOR of `num1` and `num2` is a power of 2 (2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, etc.), since these are the numbers with exactly one '1' bit in their binary representation. The function effectively identifies if the difference between `num1` and `num2` (in terms of bits set) is limited to exactly one bit being different, which includes the case where the two numbers are the same (XOR of a number with itself results in 0, which has no '1' bits) and will return False in such a scenario. The final state after the function concludes includes the original values of `num1` and `num2` remaining unchanged, as the function does not modify these inputs but only computes and returns a result based on them.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
