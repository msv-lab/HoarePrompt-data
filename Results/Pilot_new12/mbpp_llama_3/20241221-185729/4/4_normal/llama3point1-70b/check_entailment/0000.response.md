Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(num1, num2)` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. This is achieved by using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`). The XOR operator returns 1 for each position where the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different, and 0 where they are the same.

The expression `bin(num1 ^ num2)` converts the result of the XOR operation to a binary string. The `count('1')` method then counts the number of '1' characters in this string, which represents the number of bit positions where the two numbers differ.

If the count is 1, it means that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function works correctly for all possible inputs, including cases where the numbers are identical, differ at one position, or differ at multiple positions. It also works correctly for negative numbers and zero, as the binary representation of these numbers is handled correctly by the `bin()` function.

For example, `func_1(7, 5)` returns `True` because 7 (binary 111) and 5 (binary 101) differ at only one bit position. On the other hand, `func_1(7, 3)` returns `False` because 7 (binary 111) and 3 (binary 011) differ at two bit positions.

Overall, the function correctly implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any case where it does not work as expected.
