To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does.

The expression `num1 ^ num2` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `num1` and `num2`. This operation compares each bit of the first operand (`num1`) to the corresponding bit of the second operand (`num2`). If the bits are not the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. If the bits are the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

The `bin()` function converts the result of the XOR operation into a binary string. This string is prefixed with '0b' to indicate that it is a binary number.

The `count('1')` method then counts the number of '1' bits in this binary representation.

Finally, the expression `== 1` checks if the count of '1' bits is exactly 1.

Given that `num1` and `num2` are integers, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the binary representation of the XOR of `num1` and `num2` contains exactly one '1' bit.

Output State: **The program returns a boolean value (True or False) indicating whether the XOR of two integers `num1` and `num2` has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation.**
