The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, both of which are integers. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, num1 and num2, and returns True if the XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation, otherwise it returns False.**
