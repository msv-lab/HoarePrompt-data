The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the bitwise XOR operation between `num1` and `num2` results in a binary representation with exactly one '1' bit. This means the function checks if the XOR of `num1` and `num2` is a power of 2 (2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, etc.), since these are the numbers with exactly one '1' bit in their binary representation. The function effectively identifies if the difference between `num1` and `num2` (in terms of bits set) is limited to exactly one bit being different, which includes the case where the two numbers are the same (XOR of a number with itself results in 0, which has no '1' bits) and will return False in such a scenario. The final state after the function concludes includes the original values of `num1` and `num2` remaining unchanged, as the function does not modify these inputs but only computes and returns a result based on them.
