The variable `xor_result` is assigned the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The bitwise XOR operation (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`**
