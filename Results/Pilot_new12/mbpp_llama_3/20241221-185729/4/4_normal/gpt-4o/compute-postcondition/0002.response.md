The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are integers. After executing the function body, it returns a boolean value based on the XOR operation between `a` and `b`. The function returns `True` if the result of the XOR operation is a non-zero power of 2, and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, and returns True if the XOR of a and b is a non-zero power of 2, and False otherwise.**
