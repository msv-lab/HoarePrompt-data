To calculate the output state, let's first understand the components of the return statement:

1. `xor_result!= 0`: This checks if the XOR result of `a` and `b` is not equal to 0.
2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This checks if the XOR result is a power of 2 (since in binary, powers of 2 have exactly one bit set to 1, and subtracting 1 from a power of 2 gives a number that has all bits set to the right of the original bit. Thus, a bitwise AND operation between these two numbers would result in 0 for powers of 2).

The return statement `return xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` will return `True` if both conditions are met and `False` otherwise.

Given that `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`, we need to consider the properties of the XOR operation:

- `a ^ b` will be 0 if `a` and `b` are the same (since XORing two identical numbers gives 0).
- `a ^ b` will not be 0 if `a` and `b` are different.

However, to satisfy `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`, `xor_result` must be a power of 2.

The output state, therefore, depends on whether `a ^ b` results in a non-zero power of 2. If it does, the expression returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Output State: **The program returns True if the XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of 2, and False otherwise.**
