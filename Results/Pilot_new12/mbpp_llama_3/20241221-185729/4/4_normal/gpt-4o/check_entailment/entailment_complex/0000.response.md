Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem statement requires a function to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. 

The function `func_1` achieves this by using the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) to find the bits that differ between `a` and `b`. The XOR operation returns a non-zero value if the corresponding bits are different.

The function then checks if the result of the XOR operation is a non-zero power of 2. A non-zero power of 2 has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation, which means that only one bit differs between `a` and `b`.

The condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. If `xor_result` is a power of 2, then its binary representation has exactly one bit set to 1, and subtracting 1 from it will set all the bits to the right of the first 1 to 1 and the first 1 to 0. Therefore, the bitwise AND of `xor_result` and `xor_result - 1` will be 0.

The condition `xor_result!= 0` ensures that the function returns `False` if `a` and `b` are equal, because the XOR of two equal numbers is 0.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior, and it handles all possible integer inputs for `a` and `b`. 

Here are examples that demonstrate the correctness of the function:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because 13 and 9 differ at one bit position only (13 = 1101, 9 = 1001).
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because 15 and 8 differ at more than one bit position (15 = 1111, 8 = 1000).
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because 2 and 3 differ at one bit position only (2 = 10, 3 = 11).
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because 5 and 1 differ at one bit position only (5 = 101, 1 = 001). 

These examples demonstrate that the function correctly identifies whether two numbers differ at one bit position only, as required by the problem statement.
