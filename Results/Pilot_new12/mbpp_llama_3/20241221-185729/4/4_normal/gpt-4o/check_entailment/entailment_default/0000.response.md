Correctness: **True**

The problem description asks to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The provided code uses the bitwise XOR operation (`a ^ b`) to compare the two numbers. The XOR result will have exactly one bit set to 1 if and only if the two numbers differ at one bit position.

The code then checks if the XOR result is a non-zero power of 2 using the condition `xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. This condition is equivalent to checking if the XOR result has exactly one bit set to 1, which means the two numbers differ at one bit position.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior. The function correctly handles all possible integer inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because the binary representations of 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit position. Similarly, `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because the binary representations of 2 (10) and 3 (11) differ at one bit position.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
