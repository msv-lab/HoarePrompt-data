The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of 2. The function covers all possible integer inputs for `a` and `b`, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. The return value is `True` if the XOR result is a non-zero power of 2 (i.e., its binary representation has exactly one bit set to 1), and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`, and its result only depends on their values. It handles edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` is zero, or when their XOR is zero or a negative number, by correctly applying the bitwise XOR operation and the power of 2 check.
