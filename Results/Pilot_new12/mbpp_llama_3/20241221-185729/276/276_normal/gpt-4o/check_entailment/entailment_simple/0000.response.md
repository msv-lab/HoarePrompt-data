Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The problem description asks to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2`, and an integer `n` representing the size of each list.

2. It first merges the two lists into a single list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order. This is a necessary step to find the median of the combined list.

3. Then, it calculates the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`. 

4. If the length of the `merged_list` is even (which is the case since the two input lists have the same size and are combined), it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list.

5. If the length of the `merged_list` is odd (which is not the case in this problem since the two input lists have the same size and are combined, but the code handles this possibility), it calculates the median as the middle number in the sorted merged list.

The function correctly handles the case where the two input lists have the same size, and it correctly calculates the median of the combined list. The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly in different scenarios. 

In summary, the program correctly implements the solution to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size as described in the problem description.
