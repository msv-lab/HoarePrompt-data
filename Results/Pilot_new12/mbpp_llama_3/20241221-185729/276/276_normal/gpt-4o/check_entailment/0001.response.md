Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` and their size `n` as input.
2. It merges the two lists into a single list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It calculates the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`.
4. If the length of `merged_list` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`).
5. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number (`merged_list[mid]`).

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* When the length of the merged list is even, it correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers.
* When the length of the merged list is odd, it correctly calculates the median as the middle number.
* The program assumes that the input lists are sorted, which is a valid assumption according to the problem statement.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and there are no known edge cases that it does not handle, it is considered correct. The provided unit tests also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the program's correctness for different input cases.
