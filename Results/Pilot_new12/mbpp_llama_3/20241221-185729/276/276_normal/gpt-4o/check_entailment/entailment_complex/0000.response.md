Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It is designed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` and their common length `n` as input.
2. It merges these two lists into a single list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It calculates the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`.
4. If the total length of `merged_list` (which is `2n`) is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers, `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`.
5. If the total length of `merged_list` is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number, `merged_list[mid]`.
6. The function then returns the calculated median.

The program correctly handles both the cases when the total length is even and when it is odd, and it does not modify the input lists. The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
