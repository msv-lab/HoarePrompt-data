Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function takes two lists and their common length as input, merges and sorts the lists, and then calculates the median based on whether the total length is even or odd.

The code handles both cases where the total length is even and odd, and it does not modify the input lists. The median calculation is also correct, as it takes the average of the two middle numbers when the total length is even and the middle number when the total length is odd.

The output hints also agree with the code, providing examples of the function's behavior in different scenarios. The examples provided in the problem description, such as `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0` and `func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5`, demonstrate the function's correctness in calculating the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

Overall, the code appears to work correctly for every potential case, assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.
