Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it properly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code works:

1. The `func_1` function takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and their length (`n`) as input.
2. It merges the two lists into a single list (`merged_list`) and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It calculates the middle index (`mid`) of the merged list.
4. If the length of the merged list is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`).
5. If the length of the merged list is odd, it returns the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`) as the median.

The program works correctly for both even and odd lengths of the merged list. The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various inputs.

The code handles all possible cases, including:

* Even-length lists with distinct elements
* Odd-length lists with distinct elements
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers

Since the code correctly implements the logic for calculating the median of two sorted lists and handles all potential cases, it is correct.
