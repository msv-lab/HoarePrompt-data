You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`; otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`) representing their common length, and returns the median of the merged list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total length (`2n`) is even, and the middle number if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and it does not perform any error checking on the inputs (e.g., it does not verify that the lists are sorted or that their lengths match the provided `n`). After the function executes, the program returns the median of the merged list, which is a single number representing the middle value of the combined and sorted list of integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
