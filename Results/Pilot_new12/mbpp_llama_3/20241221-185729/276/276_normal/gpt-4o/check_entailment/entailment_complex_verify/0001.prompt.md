You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` and their size `n` as input.
2. It merges the two lists into a single list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It calculates the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`.
4. If the length of `merged_list` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`).
5. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number (`merged_list[mid]`).

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* When the length of the merged list is even, it correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers.
* When the length of the merged list is odd, it correctly calculates the median as the middle number.
* The program assumes that the input lists are sorted, which is a valid assumption according to the problem statement.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly and there are no known edge cases that it does not handle, it is considered correct. The provided unit tests also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the program's correctness for different input cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`; otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`) representing their common length, and returns the median of the merged list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total length (`2n`) is even, and the middle number if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and it does not perform any error checking on the inputs (e.g., it does not verify that the lists are sorted or that their lengths match the provided `n`). After the function executes, the program returns the median of the merged list, which is a single number representing the middle value of the combined and sorted list of integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
