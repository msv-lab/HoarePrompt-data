You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it properly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code works:

1. The `func_1` function takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and their length (`n`) as input.
2. It merges the two lists into a single list (`merged_list`) and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It calculates the middle index (`mid`) of the merged list.
4. If the length of the merged list is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`).
5. If the length of the merged list is odd, it returns the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`) as the median.

The program works correctly for both even and odd lengths of the merged list. The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various inputs.

The code handles all possible cases, including:

* Even-length lists with distinct elements
* Odd-length lists with distinct elements
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers

Since the code correctly implements the logic for calculating the median of two sorted lists and handles all potential cases, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`) representing their common length, and returns the median of the merged list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total length (`2n`) is even, and the middle number if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and it does not perform any error checking on the inputs (e.g., it does not verify that the lists are sorted or that their lengths match the provided `n`). After the function executes, the program returns the median of the merged list, which is a single number representing the middle value of the combined and sorted list of integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
