Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of integers. It first merges the two lists and sorts the resulting list. Then, it checks if the total length of the merged list is even or odd. If it's even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. If it's odd, the median is the middle number. 

The function assumes that the input lists are sorted and of the same length, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. The output hints agree with the code and the provided examples demonstrate the correct functionality of the function. 

The code handles both even and odd total lengths correctly, and it does not modify the input lists. The function returns a single number representing the median of the merged list, as expected.

The unit tests provided also agree with the code's functionality, and they demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. 

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and it should work correctly for every potential case, assuming valid input is provided.
