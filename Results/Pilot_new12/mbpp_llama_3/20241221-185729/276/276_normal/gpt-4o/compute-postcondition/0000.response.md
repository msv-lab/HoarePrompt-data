The given code snippet merges two sorted lists, `list1` and `list2`, into a single sorted list, `merged_list`. The initial state specifies that `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, and both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order.

After executing the code, `merged_list` will contain all elements from `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. The lengths of `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, and their sorted order is maintained within `merged_list`. The value of `n` remains the same, as it represents the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, which do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, and `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, and `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`.**
