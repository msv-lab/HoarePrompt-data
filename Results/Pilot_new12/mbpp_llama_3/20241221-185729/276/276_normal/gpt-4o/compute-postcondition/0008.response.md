The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and `n` is a positive integer. The function requires that the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal to `n`, and both lists are sorted in ascending order. After executing the function body, it returns the median of the merged and sorted list of integers from `list1` and `list2`, which is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of integers and their common length, and return the median of the merged list.

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers and their common length, and returns the median of the merged list.**
