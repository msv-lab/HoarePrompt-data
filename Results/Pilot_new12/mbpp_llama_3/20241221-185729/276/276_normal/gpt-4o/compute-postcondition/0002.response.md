Postcondition: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`. The length of the `merged_list` is even, meaning the current value of `2n` is an even number.**
