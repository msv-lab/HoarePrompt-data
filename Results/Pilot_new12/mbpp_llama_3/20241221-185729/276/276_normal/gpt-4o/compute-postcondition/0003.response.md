The value of `median` is assigned the average of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`. Given that `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is equal to `n`, and the length of `merged_list` is `2n`, `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]` represent the two middle numbers in the sorted list. Since the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of these two middle numbers.

The states of `list1`, `list2`, `n`, `merged_list`, and `mid` are not affected by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`, and `median` is equal to the average of the two middle numbers in `merged_list`, which is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`, and `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`**
