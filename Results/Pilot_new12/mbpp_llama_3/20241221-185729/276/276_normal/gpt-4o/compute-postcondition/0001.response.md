The code calculates the middle index of the `merged_list`. Since `merged_list` has a length of `2n`, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `len(merged_list) // 2`, which is equal to `2n // 2` or simply `n`. 

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`.**
