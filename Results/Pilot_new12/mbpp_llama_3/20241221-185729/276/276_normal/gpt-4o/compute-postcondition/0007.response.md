To calculate the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state includes: 
- `list1` is a sorted list of integers.
- `list2` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, which is the result of `sorted(list1 + list2)`, with a length of `2n`.
- `mid` is equal to `n`.
- The definition of `median` depends on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd. Since the length of `merged_list` is `2n`, and `n` is a positive integer, the length is always even. Therefore, `median` is calculated as `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.

Given that the length of `merged_list` is even, the `median` is the average of the two middle numbers, which are `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`.

Output State: **The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2.**
