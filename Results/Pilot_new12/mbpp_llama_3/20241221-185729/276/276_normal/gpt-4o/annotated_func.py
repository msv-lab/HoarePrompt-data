#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of integers, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)` with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`; otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer (`n`) representing their common length, and returns the median of the merged list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total length (`2n`) is even, and the middle number if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and it does not perform any error checking on the inputs (e.g., it does not verify that the lists are sorted or that their lengths match the provided `n`). After the function executes, the program returns the median of the merged list, which is a single number representing the middle value of the combined and sorted list of integers.
