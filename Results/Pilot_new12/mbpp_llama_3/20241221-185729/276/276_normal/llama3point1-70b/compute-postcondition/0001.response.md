The code introduces a new variable `middle_index` and assigns it the value `size - 1`. This means `middle_index` will be one less than the length of `list1` and `list2`, since `size` is equal to the length of both lists.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`.**
