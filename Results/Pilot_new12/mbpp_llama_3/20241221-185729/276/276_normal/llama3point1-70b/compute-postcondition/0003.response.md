To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state is: 
- `list1` is a sorted list of numbers
- `list2` is a sorted list of numbers
- `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`
- The current value of `size` is an even number
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`

The given code is:
```python
median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
```

Now, let's think step by step:

- `merged_list` has a length of `2 * size`, and since `size` is an even number, `2 * size` is also an even number.
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`, which means `middle_index + 1` is `size`.
- Since `size` is an even number and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, and `merged_list` has a length of `2 * size`, `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1` are the two middle indices of `merged_list`.
- The code calculates the `median` as the average of the values at `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1` in `merged_list`.

The output state is:
- `list1` is a sorted list of numbers
- `list2` is a sorted list of numbers
- `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, and its current value is an even number
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`
- `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`, which are the two middle numbers in the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, and its current value is an even number, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`**
