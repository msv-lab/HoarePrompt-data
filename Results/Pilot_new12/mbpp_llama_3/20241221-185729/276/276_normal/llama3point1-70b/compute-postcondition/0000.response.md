The code `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)` merges `list1` and `list2` into a single list and sorts it in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, both have the same length denoted by `size`, and both are sorted in ascending order.

Given that `list1` and `list2` are sorted and of the same length, the operation `list1 + list2` combines these two lists into one. The `sorted()` function then rearranges the elements of this combined list in ascending order.

The length of `merged_list` will be twice the length of either `list1` or `list2` since it combines both lists. Therefore, the length of `merged_list` will be `2 * size`.

The initial conditions regarding `list1` and `list2` being sorted and of the same length (`size`) are still valid, but the introduction of `merged_list` adds new information to the state.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`.**
