The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and `size` is a positive integer where `size` equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order. The function returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If the total length of the combined list (`2 * size`) is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the total length is odd, the median is the middle number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (list1 and list2) and their common length (size), and returns the median of the sorted combination of list1 and list2.**
