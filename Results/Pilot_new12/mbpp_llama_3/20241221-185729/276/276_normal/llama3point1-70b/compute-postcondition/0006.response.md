Postcondition: ***`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is `merged_list[size]`.***
