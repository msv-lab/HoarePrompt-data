Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), and returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The function first merges and sorts the two input lists, then calculates the median based on whether the total length (`2 * size`) is even or odd. If the total length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the total length is odd, the median is the middle number. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and the final state of the program includes the return of the median value, while `list1`, `list2`, and `size` remain unchanged. The function handles both even and odd length cases and does not include any error checking for invalid input, such as non-sorted input lists, non-integer values, or a `size` that does not match the length of `list1` and `list2`.**
