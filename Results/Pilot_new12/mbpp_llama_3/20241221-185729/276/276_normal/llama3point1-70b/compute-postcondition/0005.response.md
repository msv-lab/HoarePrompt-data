To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `list1` is a sorted list of numbers.
- `list2` is a sorted list of numbers.
- `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`.
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`.
- `size` is odd, since `size % 2!= 0`.

The code snippet is:
```python
median = merged_list[middle_index]
```

Given that `middle_index` is `size - 1` and `size` is odd, the `middle_index` will point to the exact middle element in the `merged_list` because the list has an even number of elements (`2 * size`), but since we are considering `size` to be odd, this implies the middle element is the one before the actual middle in an even-length list context, yet due to the odd `size`, it correctly points to the middle value in the merged sorted list context.

The impact of the code is that it assigns the value of the middle element of `merged_list` to the variable `median`. This does not change the values of `list1`, `list2`, `size`, `merged_list`, or `middle_index`, but rather assigns a new value to `median` based on the middle element of `merged_list`.

Since `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and given that `size` is odd, the middle element (at index `size - 1`) represents the median of the combined list.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `list1` is a sorted list of numbers.
- `list2` is a sorted list of numbers.
- `size` is a positive odd integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`.
- `middle_index` is `size - 1`.
- `median` is the middle element of `merged_list`, which is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive odd integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is `merged_list[size - 1]`.**
