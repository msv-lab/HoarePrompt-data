#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) and size == len(list2), list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer and equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, and its length is `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is `merged_list[size]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted combination of list1 and list2, which is either the average of the two middle numbers if the total length (2 * size) is even, or the middle number if the total length is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), and returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The function first merges and sorts the two input lists, then calculates the median based on whether the total length (`2 * size`) is even or odd. If the total length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the total length is odd, the median is the middle number. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and the final state of the program includes the return of the median value, while `list1`, `list2`, and `size` remain unchanged. The function handles both even and odd length cases and does not include any error checking for invalid input, such as non-sorted input lists, non-integer values, or a `size` that does not match the length of `list1` and `list2`.
