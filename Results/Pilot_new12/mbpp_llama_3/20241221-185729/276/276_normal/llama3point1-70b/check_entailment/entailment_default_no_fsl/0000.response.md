Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The issue lies in the calculation of the middle index. When the total length of the merged list is even, the code correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. However, when the total length is odd, the code incorrectly calculates the middle index as `size - 1`, which is the last index of the original lists, not the middle index of the merged list.

The correct calculation of the middle index should be `size * 2 // 2` when the total length is even, and `size * 2 // 2` when the total length is odd. However, since the merged list has a length of `2 * size`, the middle index should be `2 * size // 2`, which simplifies to `size`. Since list indices in Python are 0-based, the correct middle index for the merged list would be `size` for even lengths and `size` for odd lengths. But since we are merging two lists of the same size, the total length will always be even.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index1 = size - 1
    middle_index2 = size
    median = (merged_list[middle_index1] + merged_list[middle_index2]) / 2
    return median
```
Or more simply:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    median = (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2
    return median
```
