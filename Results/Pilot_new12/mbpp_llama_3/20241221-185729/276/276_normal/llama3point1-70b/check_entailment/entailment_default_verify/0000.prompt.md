You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. It merges the two lists and sorts them, which is a necessary step to find the median of the combined list.
2. It calculates the middle index of the merged list correctly, considering both even and odd cases of the total size.
3. For the even case, it correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
4. For the odd case, it correctly returns the middle element as the median.

The function seems to handle all potential cases correctly, including:

* Even and odd sizes of the input lists
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with negative numbers

I couldn't think of any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

Note: The only assumption made here is that the input lists are indeed sorted, as stated in the problem description. If the input lists are not guaranteed to be sorted, the function would need to sort them before merging, which is already handled in the provided code.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), and returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The function first merges and sorts the two input lists, then calculates the median based on whether the total length (`2 * size`) is even or odd. If the total length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the total length is odd, the median is the middle number. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and the final state of the program includes the return of the median value, while `list1`, `list2`, and `size` remain unchanged. The function handles both even and odd length cases and does not include any error checking for invalid input, such as non-sorted input lists, non-integer values, or a `size` that does not match the length of `list1` and `list2`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
