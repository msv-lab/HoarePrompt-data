Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and then finds the median based on the total length of the merged list. If the total length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the total length is odd, the median is the middle number.

The output hints provided agree with the code and indicate that the function handles both even and odd length cases. The function does not modify the original input lists, which is also as expected.

The code assumes that the input lists are sorted and of the same size, as specified in the problem description. Given this assumption, the code correctly implements the logic for finding the median of the merged list.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input lists are not sorted, are of different sizes, or contain non-integer values.

Overall, based on the code and output hints provided, the function correctly implements the logic for finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, as specified in the problem description.
