Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the median of the sorted combination of the two input lists. The issue lies in the calculation of the `middle_index`. The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the first half of the merged list. However, this is not the correct index to use when calculating the median.

When the total length of the merged list is even, the median should be the average of the two middle numbers. However, the current implementation uses `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, which are not necessarily the two middle numbers.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The `middle_index` would be `1`, and the median would be calculated as `(merged_list[1] + merged_list[2]) / 2 = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, which is correct in this case, but the general approach is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to calculate the `middle_index` as `(2 * size) // 2` when the total length is even, and `(2 * size - 1) // 2` when the total length is odd. This would ensure that the median is calculated correctly in all cases.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    if (2 * size) % 2 == 0:
        middle_index = (2 * size) // 2 - 1
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        middle_index = (2 * size - 1) // 2
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
Alternatively, the median can be calculated using the following simpler approach:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index1 = (2 * size) // 2 - 1
    middle_index2 = (2 * size) // 2 
    if (2 * size) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index1] + merged_list[middle_index2]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index2]
    return median
```
Or even simpler:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    return (merged_list[size-1] + merged_list[size]) / 2 if (2*size) % 2 == 0 else merged_list[size]
```
