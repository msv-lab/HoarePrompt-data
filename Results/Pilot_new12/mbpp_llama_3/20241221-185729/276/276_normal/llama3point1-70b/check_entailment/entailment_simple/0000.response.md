Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the median of the two sorted lists of the same size. The problem lies in the calculation of the `middle_index`. 

In the case where the total length (`2 * size`) is even, the program calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`. However, this is incorrect because the `middle_index` should be `size - 1` and `size` (the two middle numbers). The program correctly calculates the median by averaging these two numbers.

In the case where the total length (`2 * size`) is odd, the program calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`. However, this is incorrect because the `middle_index` should be `size`, not `size - 1`. This is because the total length is `2 * size`, and when this is odd, the middle index is at position `size` (not `size - 1`), not at position `size` (0-indexed).

The correct calculation of the `middle_index` should be:

- For even total length (`2 * size`), the two middle indices are `size - 1` and `size`.
- For odd total length (`2 * size`), the middle index is `size`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    if (2 * size) % 2 == 0 :
        median = (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[size]
    return median
```

This program correctly calculates the median of the two sorted lists of the same size. It first merges the two lists and sorts them. Then, it calculates the median based on whether the total length of the merged list is even or odd.
