You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the two input lists are of different sizes or when the size of the lists is not equal to the input `size` parameter. According to the problem description, the function should take two sorted lists of the same size and return the median. However, the program does not validate the input sizes, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input lists are `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2, 4]` with a size of `3`, the function will still attempt to calculate the median, which is not a valid operation in this case. Another example is when the input lists are `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4, 5]` with a size of `2`, the function will throw an error when trying to access the index `middle_index + 1`.

Additionally, the program assumes that the merged list will have an even number of elements if the input size is even, which can lead to incorrect results if the input lists have different sizes.

To fix this, the program should validate the input sizes and ensure that they match the input `size` parameter before attempting to calculate the median. 

Another issue is that the program calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1` which will give the last element in the merged list, not the middle element. The correct `middle_index` should be `size - 1` or `size` depending on whether `size` is the size of one list or both lists. Since we are given two lists of the same size, the total size of the merged list will be `2 * size` and the `middle_index` should be `size - 1` or `size` for the calculation of the median.

The function should also check if the total number of elements is odd or even to correctly calculate the median.

The correct function should be:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if len(list1)!= size or len(list2)!= size:
        raise ValueError("Input lists must be of the same size")
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
Or more simply:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if len(list1)!= size or len(list2)!= size:
        raise ValueError("Input lists must be of the same size")
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    return (merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2 - (1 - len(merged_list) % 2)] + 
            merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2]) / (2 - len(merged_list) % 2)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), and returns the median of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The function first merges and sorts the two input lists, then calculates the median based on whether the total length (`2 * size`) is even or odd. If the total length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the total length is odd, the median is the middle number. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`), and the final state of the program includes the return of the median value, while `list1`, `list2`, and `size` remain unchanged. The function handles both even and odd length cases and does not include any error checking for invalid input, such as non-sorted input lists, non-integer values, or a `size` that does not match the length of `list1` and `list2`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
