Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. It merges the two lists and sorts them, which is a necessary step to find the median of the combined list.
2. It calculates the middle index of the merged list correctly, considering both even and odd cases of the total size.
3. For the even case, it correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
4. For the odd case, it correctly returns the middle element as the median.

The function seems to handle all potential cases correctly, including:

* Even and odd sizes of the input lists
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with negative numbers

I couldn't think of any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

Note: The only assumption made here is that the input lists are indeed sorted, as stated in the problem description. If the input lists are not guaranteed to be sorted, the function would need to sort them before merging, which is already handled in the provided code.
