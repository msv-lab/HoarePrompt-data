Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the two input lists are of different sizes or when the size of the lists is not equal to the input `size` parameter. According to the problem description, the function should take two sorted lists of the same size and return the median. However, the program does not validate the input sizes, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input lists are `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2, 4]` with a size of `3`, the function will still attempt to calculate the median, which is not a valid operation in this case. Another example is when the input lists are `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4, 5]` with a size of `2`, the function will throw an error when trying to access the index `middle_index + 1`.

Additionally, the program assumes that the merged list will have an even number of elements if the input size is even, which can lead to incorrect results if the input lists have different sizes.

To fix this, the program should validate the input sizes and ensure that they match the input `size` parameter before attempting to calculate the median. 

Another issue is that the program calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1` which will give the last element in the merged list, not the middle element. The correct `middle_index` should be `size - 1` or `size` depending on whether `size` is the size of one list or both lists. Since we are given two lists of the same size, the total size of the merged list will be `2 * size` and the `middle_index` should be `size - 1` or `size` for the calculation of the median.

The function should also check if the total number of elements is odd or even to correctly calculate the median.

The correct function should be:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if len(list1)!= size or len(list2)!= size:
        raise ValueError("Input lists must be of the same size")
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
Or more simply:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    if len(list1)!= size or len(list2)!= size:
        raise ValueError("Input lists must be of the same size")
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    return (merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2 - (1 - len(merged_list) % 2)] + 
            merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2]) / (2 - len(merged_list) % 2)
```
