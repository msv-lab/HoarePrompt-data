To solve this, let's consider what the code `return nums == sorted(nums)` does. This code checks if the list `nums` is already sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

Given that `nums` is a list of elements that can be compared (such as integers or strings), the `sorted(nums)` function will rearrange these elements in ascending order.

The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will then return `True` if the original list `nums` is already in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `nums` is sorted or not.

Output State: **The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise**
