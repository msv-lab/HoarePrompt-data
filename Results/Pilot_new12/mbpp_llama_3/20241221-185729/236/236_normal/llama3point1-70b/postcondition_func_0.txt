The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and returns True for empty lists since they are considered sorted. It also handles lists containing duplicate elements, as the sorted function is stable and maintains the relative order of equal elements. If the input list is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not modify the original list and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming that the input will always be a list of comparable elements.
