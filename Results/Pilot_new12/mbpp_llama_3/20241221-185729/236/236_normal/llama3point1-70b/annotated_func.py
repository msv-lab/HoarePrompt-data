#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and returns True for empty lists since they are considered sorted. It also handles lists containing duplicate elements, as the sorted function is stable and maintains the relative order of equal elements. If the input list is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not modify the original list and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming that the input will always be a list of comparable elements.
