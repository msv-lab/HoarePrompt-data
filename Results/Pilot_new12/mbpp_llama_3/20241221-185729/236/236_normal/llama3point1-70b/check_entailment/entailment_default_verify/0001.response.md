Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version. This approach works correctly for all potential cases, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers or non-integer values.

The output hints provided confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling lists of any length, including empty lists, and returning `True` for empty lists since they are considered sorted. The function also correctly handles lists containing duplicate elements, returning `True` if they are sorted and `False` otherwise.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function's logic is sound and will work correctly for lists of any size, including edge cases like empty lists and lists with a single element. The assessment also correctly identifies that the function does not modify the original list and does not perform any error checking on the input type, which is consistent with the problem description and the provided output hints.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
