You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted or not. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` with its sorted version, which is obtained using the built-in `sorted` function.

This approach is correct for several reasons:

1. **Correct handling of sorted lists**: If the list `nums` is already sorted, then `sorted(nums)` will return the same list. In this case, the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True`, indicating that the list is indeed sorted.

2. **Correct handling of unsorted lists**: If the list `nums` is not sorted, then `sorted(nums)` will return a different list (the sorted version of `nums`). In this case, the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

3. **Handling of empty lists**: The function also correctly handles the case where the input list `nums` is empty. In this case, `sorted(nums)` will also return an empty list, and the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True`, which is correct because an empty list is considered sorted.

4. **Handling of lists with duplicate elements**: The function also correctly handles the case where the input list `nums` contains duplicate elements. In this case, `sorted(nums)` will return a list with the same elements, but in sorted order. The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise, even if the list contains duplicate elements.

5. **Handling of lists with negative numbers or zero**: The function also correctly handles the case where the input list `nums` contains negative numbers or zero. In this case, `sorted(nums)` will return a list with the same elements, but in sorted order. The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise, even if the list contains negative numbers or zero.

Overall, the provided Python function `func_1` is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and returns True for empty lists since they are considered sorted. It also handles lists containing duplicate elements, as the sorted function is stable and maintains the relative order of equal elements. If the input list is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not modify the original list and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming that the input will always be a list of comparable elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
