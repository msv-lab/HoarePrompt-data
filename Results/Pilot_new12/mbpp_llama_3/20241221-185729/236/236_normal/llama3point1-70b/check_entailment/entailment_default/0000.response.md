Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the list with its sorted version. The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. 

The output hints agree with the code, as they describe the function's behavior, including handling lists of any length, empty lists, and lists containing duplicate elements. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function, which is stable and maintains the relative order of equal elements.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:

1. Empty lists: The function returns True for empty lists, as they are considered sorted.
2. Lists of any length: The function works with lists of any length, including lists with a single element.
3. Lists containing duplicate elements: The function maintains the relative order of equal elements, as the `sorted` function is stable.
4. Lists that are already sorted: The function returns True if the input list is already sorted in ascending order.
5. Lists that are not sorted: The function returns False if the input list is not sorted in ascending order.

Since we assume that the input will always be a valid list of comparable elements, the function does not perform any error checking on the input type. Therefore, the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
