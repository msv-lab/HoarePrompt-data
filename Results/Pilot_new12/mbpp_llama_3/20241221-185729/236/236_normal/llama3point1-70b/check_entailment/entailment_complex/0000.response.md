Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted` function. If the two lists are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function also handles edge cases correctly, such as empty lists (which are considered sorted) and lists with duplicate elements. The `sorted` function is stable, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements, so the function will return `True` for lists that are already sorted in ascending order, even if they contain duplicates.

The function does not modify the original list and assumes that the input will always be a list of comparable elements, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is considered correct.
