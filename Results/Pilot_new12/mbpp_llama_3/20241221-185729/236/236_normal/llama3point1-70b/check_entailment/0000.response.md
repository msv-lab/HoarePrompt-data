Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted or not. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` with its sorted version, which is obtained using the built-in `sorted` function.

This approach is correct for several reasons:

1. **Correct handling of sorted lists**: If the list `nums` is already sorted, then `sorted(nums)` will return the same list. In this case, the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True`, indicating that the list is indeed sorted.

2. **Correct handling of unsorted lists**: If the list `nums` is not sorted, then `sorted(nums)` will return a different list (the sorted version of `nums`). In this case, the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

3. **Handling of empty lists**: The function also correctly handles the case where the input list `nums` is empty. In this case, `sorted(nums)` will also return an empty list, and the comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True`, which is correct because an empty list is considered sorted.

4. **Handling of lists with duplicate elements**: The function also correctly handles the case where the input list `nums` contains duplicate elements. In this case, `sorted(nums)` will return a list with the same elements, but in sorted order. The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise, even if the list contains duplicate elements.

5. **Handling of lists with negative numbers or zero**: The function also correctly handles the case where the input list `nums` contains negative numbers or zero. In this case, `sorted(nums)` will return a list with the same elements, but in sorted order. The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise, even if the list contains negative numbers or zero.

Overall, the provided Python function `func_1` is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.
