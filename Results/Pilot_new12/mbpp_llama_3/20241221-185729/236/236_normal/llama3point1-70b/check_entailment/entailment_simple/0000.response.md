Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted or not. It uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list and then compares the original list with the sorted list. If the lists are equal, it means the original list was already sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

- It takes a list as input, which can contain elements that can be compared (like integers or strings).
- It checks if the list is sorted in ascending order.
- It correctly handles lists that are already sorted by comparing them with their sorted versions.
- Given the problem's constraints that we assume valid input (i.e., a list that can be sorted, like numbers or strings, and no empty lists or lists that could cause an error), the function operates correctly.

There isn't a case under the given assumptions (valid, non-error-causing input) where this function does not correctly identify whether a list is sorted in ascending order. Therefore, it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
