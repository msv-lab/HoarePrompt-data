The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases. Based on the problem description and the provided code, this assessment makes sense. The function correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the original list with its sorted version.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context and supports the original assessment. It clarifies that the function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and returns True for empty lists since they are considered sorted. It also handles lists containing duplicate elements correctly, as the `sorted` function is stable and maintains the relative order of equal elements.

The annotated version of the code also mentions that the function does not modify the original list and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming that the input will always be a list of comparable elements. This is in line with the assumption made in the problem statement that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, and it handles various edge cases correctly.

Final: **True** 

The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the annotated version of the code provides additional context and supports the original assessment. The function correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, and it handles various edge cases correctly, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers or zero. The assumption that the input will always be a valid list of comparable elements is also explicitly stated in the problem statement, so the function's lack of error checking is not a concern in this context.
