Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order or not. It does this by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted` function. If the two lists are equal, it means that the input list is already sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program handles various edge cases correctly, such as:

* Empty lists: Since an empty list is considered sorted, the function returns `True` for empty lists.
* Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted` function is stable, meaning that it maintains the relative order of equal elements. Therefore, the function correctly handles lists containing duplicate elements.
* Lists of any length: The function works correctly for lists of any length, including short and long lists.

The output hints provided in the problem description agree with the code's behavior, and no potential errors or edge cases are mentioned that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, assuming that the input will always be a valid list of comparable elements, the program works correctly for every potential case.
