You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version. This approach works correctly for all potential cases because the built-in `sorted` function in Python returns a new list containing all items from the input list in ascending order. 

The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` if the input list is already sorted, and `False` otherwise. This logic is sound and will work correctly for lists of any size, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers or non-integer values.

Here are some example cases where the function works as expected:
- An empty list `[]` is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- A list with a single element, such as `[5]`, is also considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- A sorted list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will return `True`.
- An unsorted list like `[5, 2, 8, 1]` will return `False`.
- A list with duplicate elements, such as `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, will return `True` if it's sorted and `False` otherwise.

Given that this function correctly handles all potential cases and compares the list with its sorted version, which is a straightforward and effective way to check if a list is sorted, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
