You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and returns True for empty lists since they are considered sorted. It also handles lists containing duplicate elements, as the sorted function is stable and maintains the relative order of equal elements. If the input list is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not modify the original list and does not perform any error checking on the input type, assuming that the input will always be a list of comparable elements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
