Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version. This approach works correctly for all potential cases because the built-in `sorted` function in Python returns a new list containing all items from the input list in ascending order. 

The comparison `nums == sorted(nums)` will return `True` if the input list is already sorted, and `False` otherwise. This logic is sound and will work correctly for lists of any size, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative numbers or non-integer values.

Here are some example cases where the function works as expected:
- An empty list `[]` is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- A list with a single element, such as `[5]`, is also considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- A sorted list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will return `True`.
- An unsorted list like `[5, 2, 8, 1]` will return `False`.
- A list with duplicate elements, such as `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, will return `True` if it's sorted and `False` otherwise.

Given that this function correctly handles all potential cases and compares the list with its sorted version, which is a straightforward and effective way to check if a list is sorted, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
