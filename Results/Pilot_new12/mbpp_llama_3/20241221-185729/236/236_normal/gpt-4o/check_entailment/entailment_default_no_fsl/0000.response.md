Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` iterates over the list, comparing each element with the next one. If it finds a pair of elements where the first is greater than the second, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it checks all pairs without finding any that are out of order, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with a single element, correctly returning `True` in these cases as they are considered sorted by definition.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) support the correctness of the function, covering both sorted and unsorted lists. Additionally, the function does not modify the original list, adhering to good programming practices.

The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior and do not indicate any missing logic or edge cases that the code fails to handle. Since we assume that the input will always be a valid list (not empty or containing non-comparable elements), the code is robust within the constraints of the problem description.

Overall, the code adheres to the problem description and handles every potential case correctly, assuming valid input.
