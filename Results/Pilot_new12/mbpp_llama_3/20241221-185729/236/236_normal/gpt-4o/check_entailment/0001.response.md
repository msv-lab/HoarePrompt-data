Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds any pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists that are already sorted in ascending order
* Lists that are not sorted
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with negative numbers
* Lists with a single element (which is considered sorted)
* Empty lists (although the function does not explicitly handle this case, it will correctly return `True` because the `range` function will be empty and the loop will not be executed)

I could not find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also cover some of these cases and the function passes them. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
