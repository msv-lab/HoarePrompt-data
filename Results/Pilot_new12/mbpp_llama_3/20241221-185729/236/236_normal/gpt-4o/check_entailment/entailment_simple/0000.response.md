Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order or not. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and iterates through each element in the list (excluding the last one).
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `lst[i]` is greater than the next element `lst[i + 1]`. If this condition is true, it means the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order, so the function immediately returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such pair of elements (i.e., the list is sorted in non-decreasing order), the function returns `True`.
4. The program handles lists of any length, including empty lists or lists with a single element, correctly returning `True` for these cases (since they are technically sorted).
5. The program also correctly handles lists that are sorted in non-decreasing order, returning `True` for these cases.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various scenarios:
- A sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` returns `True`.
- A list that is not sorted `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` returns `False`.
- Another list that is not sorted `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` returns `False`.

Overall, the program accurately checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
