Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with its next element. If it finds any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it successfully checks all pairs of adjacent elements without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Sorted lists**: The function correctly returns `True` for lists that are in ascending order.
2. **Unsorted lists**: The function correctly returns `False` for lists that are not in ascending order, including lists with elements in descending order or lists with elements that are not in a specific order.
3. **Empty lists**: Although not explicitly tested, the function would correctly return `True` for an empty list, as there are no elements to compare.
4. **Lists with duplicate elements**: The function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements, as it only checks if an element is greater than its next element, not if they are equal.

Since the function handles all these potential cases correctly and no counterexample can be found, the program is considered correct.
