Correctness: **True**

The code provided for `func_1` checks if a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order, which aligns with the problem description. The function correctly handles lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with a single element, by returning `True` for these cases as they are considered sorted. For lists with two or more elements, it iterates through each pair of adjacent elements, checking if the current element is greater than the next one. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration without finding any out-of-order pairs, it returns `True`, confirming the list is sorted.

The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including sorted lists and lists that are not sorted. The function does not modify the original list and only compares elements using the less-than operator, ensuring compatibility with lists containing comparable elements.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem and handles various cases correctly, and assuming the input will always be a valid list, the code correctly implements the desired functionality. The output hints align with the code's behavior, reinforcing the conclusion that the function works as intended for its specified task.
