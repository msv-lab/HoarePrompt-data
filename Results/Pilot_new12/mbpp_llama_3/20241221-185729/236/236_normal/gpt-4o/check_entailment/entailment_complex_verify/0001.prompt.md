You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds any pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists that are already sorted in ascending order
* Lists that are not sorted
* Lists with duplicate elements
* Lists with negative numbers
* Lists with a single element (which is considered sorted)
* Empty lists (although the function does not explicitly handle this case, it will correctly return `True` because the `range` function will be empty and the loop will not be executed)

I could not find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also cover some of these cases and the function passes them. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the state remains unchanged. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, either the program returns False (indicating that `lst` is not sorted in non-decreasing order) or the loop completes without returning False (indicating that `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order).
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It accepts a list of comparable elements as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with a single element, in which case it returns `True` as these are considered sorted. For lists with two or more elements, it verifies that each element is less than or equal to the next one. If it finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding any that are out of order, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not modify the original list and does not handle cases where the list contains non-comparable elements, as such elements would cause an error during the comparison.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
