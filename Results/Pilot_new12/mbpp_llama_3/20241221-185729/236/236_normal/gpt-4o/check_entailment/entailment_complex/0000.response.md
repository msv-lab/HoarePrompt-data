Correctness: **True**

The program correcty implements the function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not, as stated in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

- The function `func_1` accepts a list of comparable elements as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted.
- It iterates through each pair of adjacent elements in the list, checking if the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the function checks all pairs of adjacent elements without finding any that are out of order, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with a single element, correctly returning `True` for these cases as they are considered sorted.
- The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function for different scenarios, including lists that are sorted and lists that are not sorted.

The function does not need to explicitly handle cases like empty lists or lists with a single element because the for loop does not execute in these cases, and the function correctly returns `True` as per the problem description. 

Therefore, the program always follows the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
