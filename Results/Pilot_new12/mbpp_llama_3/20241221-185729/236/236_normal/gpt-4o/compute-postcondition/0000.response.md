To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(len(lst) - 1):`. This means the loop will iterate over a range of indices from 0 up to, but not including, the second last index of `lst`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst) - 1` must be greater than 0. This implies that `lst` must have at least 2 elements. If `lst` had fewer than 2 elements, `len(lst) - 1` would either be 0 (if `lst` had 1 element) or negative (if `lst` were empty), and the loop would not execute.

Given that `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, we also acknowledge that the loop variable `i` will take on values starting from 0, internally managed by the loop construct.

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `lst` must have at least 2 elements, and at the start of the loop, `i` would be initialized to 0, which is the first index in the range generated by `range(len(lst) - 1)`.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
