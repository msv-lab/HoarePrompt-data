Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the condition `lst[i]` less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]` holds, as given in the precondition, and the state of the program remains unchanged since there is no else part that modifies the state.***
