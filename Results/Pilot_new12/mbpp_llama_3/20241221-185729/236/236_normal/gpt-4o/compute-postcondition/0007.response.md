According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `lst` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since `i` is now 2, the condition `i` less than `len(lst) - 1` implies that `len(lst)` must be at least 3 + 1, which is 4, so `lst` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 4 elements, `i` is 2**
