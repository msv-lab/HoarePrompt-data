The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The return value is determined by the following conditions: 

Case_1, Case_2, and Case_3 are not fulfilled, 
Case_4 is fulfilled and the function returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Since Case_1, Case_2, and Case_3 are not described but all return `False`, we assume these cases represent various scenarios where the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return `True` if `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
