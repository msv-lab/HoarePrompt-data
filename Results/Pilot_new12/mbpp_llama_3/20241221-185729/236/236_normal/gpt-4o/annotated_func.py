#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the state remains unchanged. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, either the program returns False (indicating that `lst` is not sorted in non-decreasing order) or the loop completes without returning False (indicating that `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order).
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It accepts a list of comparable elements as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with a single element, in which case it returns `True` as these are considered sorted. For lists with two or more elements, it verifies that each element is less than or equal to the next one. If it finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding any that are out of order, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not modify the original list and does not handle cases where the list contains non-comparable elements, as such elements would cause an error during the comparison.
