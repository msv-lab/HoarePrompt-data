The function `func_1` checks if a given list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It accepts a list of comparable elements as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with a single element, in which case it returns `True` as these are considered sorted. For lists with two or more elements, it verifies that each element is less than or equal to the next one. If it finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding any that are out of order, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not modify the original list and does not handle cases where the list contains non-comparable elements, as such elements would cause an error during the comparison.
