Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it only removes spaces from the input string, not all types of whitespaces. The problem description asks to remove all whitespaces, which includes not only spaces but also tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and other whitespace characters. The provided code only uses the `replace` method to remove spaces (`' '`) and does not account for other types of whitespaces. Therefore, it does not work correctly for all potential cases, such as strings containing tabs or newlines. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should be modified to remove all types of whitespaces, for example, by using the `replace` method in combination with other characters or by using regular expressions to match all whitespace characters. An example of correct code could be:
```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```
