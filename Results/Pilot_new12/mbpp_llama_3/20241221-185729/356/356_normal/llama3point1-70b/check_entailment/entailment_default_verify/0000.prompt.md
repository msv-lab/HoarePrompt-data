You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` only removes spaces (' ') from the string, but it does not remove other types of whitespaces such as tabs ('\t'), newlines ('\n'), or carriage returns ('\r'). The problem description asks to remove all whitespaces, not just spaces. 

For example, if the input string is "Hello\tWorld\n", the function will return "Hello\tWorld\n" instead of "HelloWorld", which is incorrect. 

A correct implementation would use the `replace` method with all types of whitespaces, or use a regular expression to match all whitespace characters. 

For example:
```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```
This function uses the regular expression `\s+` to match one or more whitespace characters, and replaces them with an empty string, effectively removing all whitespaces from the input string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `input_str` and returns a new string where all spaces have been removed from the original `input_str`. The function handles all types of input strings, including empty strings and strings containing multiple consecutive spaces, by removing all spaces from them. It does not modify the original `input_str` but instead returns a new string with the spaces removed, thus preserving the original input. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, implying it assumes the input will always be a string or an object that can be treated as a string with a `replace` method. If `input_str` is not a string or does not have a `replace` method, the function may throw an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
