Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly implement the problem description to remove all whitespaces from a string. The issue lies in the fact that it only removes space characters (' '), not all types of whitespace characters. Whitespace characters include spaces, tabs ('\t'), line breaks ('\n'), carriage returns ('\r'), and other special characters like vertical tabs ('\v') and form feeds ('\f'). 

The `replace` method used in the function only targets the space character (' '). To correctly remove all whitespaces, the function should use a regular expression that matches all whitespace characters, or use the `str.translate` method along with `str.maketrans` to remove all whitespace characters.

For example, if the input string is `"Hello\nWorld"`, the function will return `"Hello\nWorld"`, not `"HelloWorld"`, because it only removes space characters, not newline characters. This shows that the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case. 

Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
