Correctness: **False**

The given function only removes spaces (' ') from the string, but it does not account for other types of whitespaces such as tabs ('\t'), line breaks ('\n'), or carriage returns ('\r'). According to the problem description, the function should remove "all whitespaces" from the string, not just spaces. 

For example, if the input string is "\tHello\nWorld", the function will return "\tHello\nWorld" instead of "HelloWorld", which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should use a regular expression to replace all whitespace characters, not just spaces. The corrected function could be:

```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

This version of the function uses the regular expression '\s+', which matches one or more whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, line breaks, and carriage returns). The re.sub function then replaces all occurrences of these whitespace characters with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string.
