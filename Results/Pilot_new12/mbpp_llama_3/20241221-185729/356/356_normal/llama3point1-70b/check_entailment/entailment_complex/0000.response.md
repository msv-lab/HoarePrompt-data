Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description because it only removes spaces from the input string, not all types of whitespaces. The problem description asks for a function to remove "all whitespaces" from a string, implying that it should handle not just spaces (' ') but also other types of whitespace characters such as tabs ('\t'), newline characters ('\n'), and carriage return characters ('\r').

The provided function `func_1` uses the `replace` method with the argument `' '`, which specifically targets spaces. This means it will not remove other types of whitespace characters. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of removing "all whitespaces" as stated in the problem description.

To meet the problem description's requirements, the function could be modified to remove all whitespace characters, potentially using a regular expression to match any whitespace character, or by specifically targeting all known whitespace characters in a loop or through a method that inherently removes all types of whitespace, such as `str.split()` without arguments and then joining the results back together, or more directly using `str.translate()` or `re.sub()` with an appropriate pattern. For example, a corrected version using `re.sub()` could look like this:

```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

This version of `func_1` uses a regular expression (`\s+`) to match one or more whitespace characters and replaces them with nothing (`''`), effectively removing all whitespace from the input string, thus aligning with the problem description's requirements.
