Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that removes all whitespaces from a string. The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method to remove all spaces from the input string `s`.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The `replace` method is a standard string method in Python that replaces occurrences of a specified phrase with another specified phrase.
- In this case, `s.replace(' ', '')` replaces all occurrences of a space (`' '`) with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing them.
- This means that regardless of the number of spaces (one, multiple, or none) in the input string, the function will correctly remove all of them, returning a string without any whitespaces.
- The function handles edge cases such as leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces because `replace` works globally on the string.

For example, given the inputs from the assertions:
- 'python  program' becomes 'pythonprogram'
- 'python   programming    language' becomes 'pythonprogramminglanguage'
- 'python                     program' becomes 'pythonprogram'
- '   python                     program' becomes 'pythonprogram'

All these examples demonstrate that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
