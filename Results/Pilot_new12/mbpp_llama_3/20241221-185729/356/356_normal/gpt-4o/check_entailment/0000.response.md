Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` is designed to remove all whitespaces from a given string `s`. It utilizes the built-in `replace()` method in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a specified value with another value. In this case, it replaces all spaces (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing them.

The function works as expected for all the provided test cases, removing all spaces from the input strings. Additionally, the function should work correctly for any string, regardless of the number or position of spaces within it.

For example, it will correctly handle strings with leading spaces, trailing spaces, or multiple consecutive spaces, as demonstrated in the provided assertions. It will also handle strings with no spaces at all, returning the original string unchanged.

A key point to consider is whether the function would work correctly for strings containing different types of whitespace characters (like tabs, newline characters, etc.), not just the space character (' '). However, according to the problem description, it specifically asks to remove "whitespaces" without detailing the type, but based on the provided code and assertions, it seems the focus is on the space character. If the intention was to remove all types of whitespace characters, the function would be incorrect because it only removes space characters (' '). But given the context and the specific assertions provided, which only test for space characters, the function appears to be correct within this narrow scope.

In a broader sense, if the goal is to remove all types of whitespace characters (not just space characters), Python's `str.replace()` method used in this function would not be sufficient on its own, and a more comprehensive approach, such as using regular expressions or the `str.translate()` method in combination with `str.maketrans()`, would be needed. However, for the specific assertions and the described use case, the function behaves correctly.
