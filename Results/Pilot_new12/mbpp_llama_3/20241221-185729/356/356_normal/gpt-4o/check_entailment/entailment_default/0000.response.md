Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method of the string class to remove all spaces from the input string `s`. The `replace` method returns a copy of the string where all occurrences of a substring are replaced with another substring. In this case, it replaces all spaces with an empty string, effectively removing them.

The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty strings, strings with leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces, and strings without any spaces. The input string `s` itself remains unchanged, as the function returns a new string object with the spaces removed.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function correctly removes all spaces from the input string, handling all potential edge cases. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can conclude that the function is correct and will work as expected for all valid input cases.
