Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to remove all whitespaces from a string. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that by using the `replace` method to remove all spaces from the input string `s`.

The function is designed to handle all potential edge cases, including:

* Empty strings: The function will return an empty string, which has no spaces.
* Strings with leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces: The `replace` method will remove all spaces, regardless of their position or frequency.
* Strings without any spaces: The function will return the original string, as there are no spaces to remove.

The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, but as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty string).

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness, covering various scenarios with different numbers and positions of spaces.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is verified.
