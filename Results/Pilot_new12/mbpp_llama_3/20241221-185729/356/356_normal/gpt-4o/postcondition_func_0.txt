The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the string `s` with all spaces removed, handling all potential edge cases including empty strings, strings with leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces, and strings without any spaces. The input string `s` itself remains unchanged, as the function returns a new string object with the spaces removed. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so if a non-string object is passed, it may raise an error or behave unexpectedly.
