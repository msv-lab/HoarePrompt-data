The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`. It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its starting position (`start_pos`), and its ending position (`end_pos`) within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, it returns `None`. The function does not modify the input strings and does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during execution, such as `main_string` or `sub_string` being `None` or not being strings. The function's return values indicate whether the search was successful and, if so, provide information about the location of `sub_string` within `main_string`.
