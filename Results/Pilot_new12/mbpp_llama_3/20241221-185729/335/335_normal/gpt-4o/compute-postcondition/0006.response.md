The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, both of which are strings. After executing the function body, there are two possible return scenarios: 
Case_1: The function returns `None`.
Case_2: The function returns a string `sub_string`, its starting position `start_pos` in `main_string`, and its ending position `end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`. This implies that `sub_string` is found within `main_string` at a position that is not -1, indicating a successful search.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two string parameters, main_string and sub_string, and return either None or the sub_string along with its start and end positions in main_string if the sub_string is found.
