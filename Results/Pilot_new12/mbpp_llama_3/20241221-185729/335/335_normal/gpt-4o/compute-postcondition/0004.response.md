The value of `end_pos` is assigned as the sum of `start_pos` and the length of `sub_string`. The value of `start_pos` is the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and it is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`.

The states of `main_string` and `sub_string` are not affected. The state of `start_pos` is also not affected, as it is used to calculate the new value of `end_pos`. 

`end_pos` is equal to `start_pos + len(sub_string)`, which is the position right after the occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string` and `start_pos` is not equal to -1, `end_pos` is equal to `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string` and `start_pos` is not equal to -1, `end_pos` is equal to `start_pos + len(sub_string)`**
