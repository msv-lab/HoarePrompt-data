Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string and return `None` if the substring is not found.

The code uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring, and it correctly handles cases where the substring is not found by returning `None`. The provided unit tests also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the program's behavior with different inputs.

The output hints provided match the functionality implemented in the code and do not reveal any potential errors or edge cases that the code does not handle. The hints accurately describe the program's behavior, including its return values and the information it provides about the location of the substring.

Given the information available, I maintain the original assessment because the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and there is no evidence to suggest that it behaves incorrectly under the assumed valid input conditions.

Final: **True**
