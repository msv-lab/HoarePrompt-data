The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints. The program uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring in the main string, which aligns with the problem description. The program correctly handles cases where the substring is found or not found, returning a tuple with the substring, its start position, and its end position if found, and `None` if not found.

The output hints provide additional context about the program's behavior, confirming that it searches for the first occurrence of the substring and returns the expected information if found. The hints also mention potential exceptions that the function does not handle, such as `main_string` or `sub_string` being `None` or not being strings. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will always be valid, so these exceptions are not considered in the correctness assessment.

The provided code is also consistent with the problem description. It correctly implements the required functionality using the `find()` method and returns the expected results. The unit tests included in the code further verify its correctness by covering different scenarios, including successful searches and a case where the substring is not found.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment remains accurate. The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, handles edge cases correctly, and provides the expected output.

Final: **True**
