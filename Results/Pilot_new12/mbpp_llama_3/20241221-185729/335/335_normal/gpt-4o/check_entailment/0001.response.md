Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. 

- It uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring in the main string.
- If the substring is not found, `find()` returns -1 and the function returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its end position (calculated as the starting position plus the length of the substring).

The program also handles all edge cases correctly, including:

- An empty main string: `find()` will return -1, and the function will return `None`.
- An empty substring: `find()` will return 0, indicating the substring is found at the start of the main string, and the function will return the correct tuple.
- A substring that is not found in the main string: `find()` will return -1, and the function will return `None`.
- A substring that appears multiple times in the main string: The function will return the position of the first occurrence, as specified by the `find()` method.

Overall, the program seems to meet all the requirements specified in the problem description, and it handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
