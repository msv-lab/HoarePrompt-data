Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function that finds the occurrence and position of substrings within a string, returning None if there is no match. 

Here's why the program does what the problem description says for every potential case:

1. **Finding the occurrence and position of substrings**: The function `func_1` uses the `find` method of the string class to find the starting position of the substring in the main string. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of the substring to the starting position.

2. **Returning None if there is no match**: If the substring is not found, the `find` method returns -1. The function then checks for this condition and returns None as specified in the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases as follows:
- If the substring is present in the main string, it correctly returns the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.
- If the substring is not present in the main string, it correctly returns None.

The provided unit tests also support this conclusion, showing that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios. 

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all potential cases as required.
