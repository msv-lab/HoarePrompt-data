Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

Upon examination, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. It correctly identifies the start and end positions of the substring, and it handles cases where the substring is not found. The provided unit tests also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the program's behavior with different inputs.

The program's logic is straightforward and easy to follow. It uses the `find()` method to locate the substring, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, `find()` returns `-1`, and the program returns `None`. The start position is the index returned by `find()`, and the end position is calculated by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
