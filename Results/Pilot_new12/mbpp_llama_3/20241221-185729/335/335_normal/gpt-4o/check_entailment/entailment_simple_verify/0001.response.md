The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. It correctly identifies the program's behavior and handling of edge cases. The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment, as it outlines the program's state at different points and confirms that the program behaves as expected.

The annotated code indicates that the program returns `None` when the substring is not found, and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position when the substring is found. This aligns with the problem description and the original assessment.

The original assessment correctly notes that the program handles edge cases, such as an empty main string, an empty substring, and a substring that appears multiple times in the main string. The annotated code does not provide any evidence to contradict this assessment.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
