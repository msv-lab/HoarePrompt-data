Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string as described in the problem description. It returns `None` if there is no match, which aligns with the requirements.

The function `func_1` uses the `find` method of the string class to locate the first occurrence of the `sub_string` within the `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it calculates the starting and ending positions (`start_pos` and `end_pos`) and returns them in a tuple along with the `sub_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, the `find` method returns `-1`, which triggers the function to return `None`.

All the provided unit tests support the correctness of the code. Each test case either finds a match and returns the substring and its positions correctly or returns `None` when there is no match, exactly as specified in the problem description.

Moreover, assuming valid input (as stated in the instructions), the function should work correctly for all potential cases. It does not modify the input strings, and it does not handle potential exceptions such as `None` or non-string inputs, but this behavior is explicitly noted and does not contradict the problem description given the assumption of valid input.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the code meets the requirements and handles every potential case as described, assuming valid input.
