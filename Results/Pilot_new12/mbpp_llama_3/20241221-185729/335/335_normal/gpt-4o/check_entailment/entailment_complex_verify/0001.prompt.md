You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. 

- It uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring in the main string.
- If the substring is not found, `find()` returns -1 and the function returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its end position (calculated as the starting position plus the length of the substring).

The program also handles all edge cases correctly, including:

- An empty main string: `find()` will return -1, and the function will return `None`.
- An empty substring: `find()` will return 0, indicating the substring is found at the start of the main string, and the function will return the correct tuple.
- A substring that is not found in the main string: `find()` will return -1, and the function will return `None`.
- A substring that appears multiple times in the main string: The function will return the position of the first occurrence, as specified by the `find()` method.

Overall, the program seems to meet all the requirements specified in the problem description, and it handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string and sub_string are strings.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `start_pos` is the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string` and `start_pos` is not equal to -1, meaning `sub_string` is found in `main_string`
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns a string 'sub_string', the starting position 'start_pos' of 'sub_string' in 'main_string' where 'start_pos' is not equal to -1, and the ending position 'end_pos' which is 'start_pos' plus the length of 'sub_string'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`. It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its starting position (`start_pos`), and its ending position (`end_pos`) within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, it returns `None`. The function does not modify the input strings and does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during execution, such as `main_string` or `sub_string` being `None` or not being strings. The function's return values indicate whether the search was successful and, if so, provide information about the location of `sub_string` within `main_string`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
