Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct. It uses the `find()` method of Python strings to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, it returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns `None`. 

The code handles the basic cases as shown in the unit tests. For example, it correctly finds the first occurrence of 'python' in the string 'python programming, python language', and it returns `None` when 'python' is not found in the string 'c++ programming, c++ language'.

The code also follows the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns `None` if there is no match. The function does not modify the input strings and does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during execution, such as `main_string` or `sub_string` being `None` or not being strings. However, this is not considered an issue since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The output hints agree with the code and help confirm that the code is correct. The function returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position within `main_string` if `sub_string` is found, and `None` otherwise. 

Overall, the code seems to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description and output hints.
