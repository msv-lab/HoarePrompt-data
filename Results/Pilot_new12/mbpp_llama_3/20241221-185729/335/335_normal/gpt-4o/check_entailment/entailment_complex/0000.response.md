Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks to write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and return None if there is no match.

The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that. It uses the `find()` method of the string class to search for the first occurrence of the `sub_string` within the `main_string`. If the `sub_string` is found, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of the `sub_string` to the starting position and returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position. If the `sub_string` is not found, the `find()` method returns -1, and the function returns None.

The assertions provided also validate the correctness of the function for different test cases, including when the substring is found and when it's not.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and its output matches the expected results for all potential cases.
