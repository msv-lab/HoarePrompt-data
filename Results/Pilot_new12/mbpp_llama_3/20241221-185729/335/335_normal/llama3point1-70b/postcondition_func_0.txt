The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` or a tuple containing the `substring`, its start index within the `string`, and the index of its last character. If the `substring` is found in the `string`, the function returns the `substring` along with its start and end indices. If the `substring` is not found in the `string`, the function returns `None`. The function handles cases where the `substring` is an empty string or the `string` itself, and it correctly calculates the end index of the `substring` as the start index plus the length of the `substring` minus one. The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for such cases. The function also does not modify the input strings in any way.
