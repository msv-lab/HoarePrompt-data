Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I will analyze the program's behavior and provide a refined assessment of its correctness.

The problem description requires a function to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string, returning None if there is no match. The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` meets these requirements.

The annotated code provides additional insights into the program's state at different points. After the `if` block, it states that `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `start` is not equal to -1, meaning `substring` is found in `string`. This aligns with the original assessment.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the original assessment does not explicitly mention the handling of edge cases, such as an empty string as the input or substring. The annotated code does not provide any information about these edge cases either.

Despite this, the original assessment provides a thorough breakdown of why the function is correct, including the use of the `find` method, calculation of the ending position, and handling of the case when the substring is not found.

Based on the provided information, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` appears to correctly find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and returns None if there is no match. The annotated code supports this assessment, and I could not find any evidence to contradict it.

However, it is worth noting that the function could be improved to handle invalid inputs or provide more informative output. Nevertheless, based on the problem description and the assumptions provided, the function meets the requirements.

Final: **True**
