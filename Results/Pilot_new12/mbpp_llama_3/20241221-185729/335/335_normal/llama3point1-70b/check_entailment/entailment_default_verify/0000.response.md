The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the occurrence and position of the substring within a string and returns `None` if there is no match. The output hints also support this assessment, providing examples of cases where the code is working correctly.

The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the substring is an empty string or the same as the string itself. The function also correctly calculates the end index of the substring.

Although the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings, this does not necessarily make the program incorrect. The problem description assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., two strings), and the function behaves as expected under these conditions.

Therefore, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is maintained because the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.

Final: **True**
