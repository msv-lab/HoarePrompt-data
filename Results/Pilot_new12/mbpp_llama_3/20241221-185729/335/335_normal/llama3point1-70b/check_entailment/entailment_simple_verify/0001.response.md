The original assessment claims that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position, whereas the problem description asks for the occurrence and position of "the substrings" (plural). This implies that the program should find all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program indeed only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position. The annotations confirm that the `start` variable holds the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string, and the program returns this index along with the substring and the index of the last character of the substring.

Given that the problem description uses the plural form "substrings" and the program only finds the first occurrence of the substring, it is reasonable to conclude that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program's correctness should be evaluated as **False**.

The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the problem description implies that the program should find all occurrences of the substring, whereas the provided code only finds the first occurrence. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program only finds the first occurrence, which supports the original assessment.

Final: **False**
