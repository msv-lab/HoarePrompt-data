Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns the occurrence and position of the `substring` within the `string`.
2. If the `substring` is not found in the `string`, the `find` method returns -1, and the function returns `None` as required by the problem description.
3. If the `substring` is found, the function returns the `substring`, its start index, and the index of the last character of the `substring` in the `string`. The start index is obtained using the `find` method, and the end index is calculated by adding the length of the `substring` to the start index and then subtracting 1 (since indexing is 0-based).
4. The program assumes that the input will be valid, which means that `string` and `substring` will always be strings and will not cause any errors in the program.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the `substring` is found in the `string`
* When the `substring` is not found in the `string`
* When the `string` and `substring` are both empty strings (in which case the `find` method will return 0 and the function will return the `substring`, 0, and -1)

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly, its correctness is **True**.
