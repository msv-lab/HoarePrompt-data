Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for the occurrence and position of "the substrings" (plural), implying that the function should find all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one. The original assessment points out this limitation in the provided code, which only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position.

The output hints do not contradict the original assessment. Instead, they confirm that the function only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position, which is not in line with the problem description's requirement to find all occurrences.

The corrected version of the function provided in the original assessment addresses this limitation by using a loop and the `find` method with the `start` parameter to find all occurrences of the substring.

Therefore, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Final: **False**
