Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases because it only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position. However, the problem description asks for the occurrence and position of "the substrings" (plural), which implies that it should find all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one. 

For example, if we call the function `func_1("ababa", "ab")`, it will return `('ab', 0, 1)` but it should also find the second occurrence of "ab" at positions 2-3 and the third occurrence at positions 4-5. 

The function should be modified to use a loop and the `find` method with the `start` parameter to find all occurrences of the substring. Here is an example of a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    occurrences = []
    start = string.find(substring)
    while start!= -1:
        end = start + len(substring) - 1
        occurrences.append((substring, start, end))
        start = string.find(substring, start + 1)
    if occurrences:
        return occurrences
    return None
```
