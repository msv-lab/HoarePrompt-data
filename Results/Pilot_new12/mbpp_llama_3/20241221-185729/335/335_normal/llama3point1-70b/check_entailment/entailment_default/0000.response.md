Correctness: **True**

The provided code follows the problem description for every potential case. It takes a string and a substring as input, and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start index, and its end index if the substring is found in the string. If the substring is not found, it returns None.

The code correctly handles cases where the substring is an empty string, the string itself, or any other substring. The start and end indices are calculated correctly using the `find` method and the length of the substring.

The output hints agree with the code, and they provide more details about the function's behavior. The hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings, but this is not a requirement in the problem description. We assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Overall, the code meets all the requirements in the problem description, and it does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
