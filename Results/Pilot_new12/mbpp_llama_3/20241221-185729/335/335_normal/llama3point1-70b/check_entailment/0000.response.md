Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(string, substring)` appears to be correct as it returns the occurrence and position of the substring within the string, and `None` if there is no match.

Here's a breakdown of why this function is correct:

1. The `find` method is used to get the starting position of the substring in the string. This method returns `-1` if the substring is not found.
2. If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring itself, the starting position, and the ending position (which is `start + len(substring) - 1`).
3. The ending position is calculated correctly by subtracting 1 from `end` (which is `start + len(substring)`), because Python uses zero-based indexing.
4. If the substring is not found, the function returns `None`, as specified in the problem description.

The function handles the following edge cases correctly:

- If the substring is an empty string, `find` returns 0, which is correct.
- If the substring is the same as the string, `find` returns 0, and the function returns the correct tuple.
- If the substring is not present in the string, `find` returns -1, and the function returns `None`.

Overall, the function seems to work as expected, and I couldn't find any potential cases where it would not work correctly.
