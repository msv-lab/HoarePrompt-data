The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position, whereas the problem description asks for the occurrence and position of "the substrings" (plural). This implies that the function should find all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function only finds the first occurrence of the substring and returns its position. The annotation states that "The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` or a tuple containing the `substring`, its start index within the `string`, and the index of its last character." This suggests that the function is designed to find only the first occurrence of the substring.

However, the problem description does ask for the occurrence and position of "the substrings" (plural), which implies that the function should find all occurrences of the substring. The provided corrected version of the function also supports this interpretation, as it uses a loop to find all occurrences of the substring.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the problem description because it only finds the first occurrence of the substring, whereas the problem description asks for all occurrences.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the function's behavior, but it does not change the fact that the function only finds the first occurrence of the substring. The annotation's statement that "The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings" is also irrelevant to the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description.

Final: **False**
