Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment makes sense. The function `func_1` correctly returns the occurrence and position of the substring within the string, and `None` if there is no match. 

The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment, as it explains the state of the program at different points and how the function handles various edge cases. 

One potential point of confusion is that the original assessment and the annotated version note that the function does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings. However, the problem description assumes that the input will be valid, so this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct based on the problem description and the provided code.

Final: **True**
