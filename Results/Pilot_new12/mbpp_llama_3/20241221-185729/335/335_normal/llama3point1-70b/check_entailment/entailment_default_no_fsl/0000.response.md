Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings. The problem description does not explicitly state that the input parameters will always be strings, but it does imply that the function should be able to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string. Therefore, the code should include error checking to handle cases where the input parameters are not strings.

For example, if the input parameters are integers or lists, the `find()` method will throw an error, and the function will not return the expected result. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or `None`, which could also lead to errors.

To make the code correct, it should include error checking to ensure that the input parameters are strings, and handle cases where they are not. It should also handle edge cases such as empty strings or `None` input.

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to handle these cases:
```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    if not isinstance(string, str) or not isinstance(substring, str):
        raise TypeError("Input parameters must be strings")
    if not string or not substring:
        return None
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```
