You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(string, substring)` appears to be correct as it returns the occurrence and position of the substring within the string, and `None` if there is no match.

Here's a breakdown of why this function is correct:

1. The `find` method is used to get the starting position of the substring in the string. This method returns `-1` if the substring is not found.
2. If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring itself, the starting position, and the ending position (which is `start + len(substring) - 1`).
3. The ending position is calculated correctly by subtracting 1 from `end` (which is `start + len(substring)`), because Python uses zero-based indexing.
4. If the substring is not found, the function returns `None`, as specified in the problem description.

The function handles the following edge cases correctly:

- If the substring is an empty string, `find` returns 0, which is correct.
- If the substring is the same as the string, `find` returns 0, and the function returns the correct tuple.
- If the substring is not present in the string, `find` returns -1, and the function returns `None`.

Overall, the function seems to work as expected, and I couldn't find any potential cases where it would not work correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns either `None` or a tuple containing the `substring`, its start index within the `string`, and the index of its last character. If the `substring` is found in the `string`, the function returns the `substring` along with its start and end indices. If the `substring` is not found in the `string`, the function returns `None`. The function handles cases where the `substring` is an empty string or the `string` itself, and it correctly calculates the end index of the `substring` as the start index plus the length of the `substring` minus one. The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are not strings, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for such cases. The function also does not modify the input strings in any way.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
