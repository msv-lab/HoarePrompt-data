Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its start index within the `string`, and the index of its last character if the `substring` is found. If the `substring` is not found, it returns `None`.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Occurs or returns None**: The program correctly returns `None` if there is no match. The `find()` method returns `-1` if the `substring` is not found, and the program checks for this condition, returning `None` immediately.

2. **Position of the substring**: If the `substring` is found, the program returns the start index of the `substring` in the `string`. This start index is obtained using the `find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the `substring` in the `string`.

3. **Occurrence of the substring**: The program also returns the `substring` itself, ensuring that the occurrence of the `substring` within the `string` is correctly identified.

4. **End index calculation**: The program calculates the end index of the `substring` as `start + len(substring) - 1`, which is correct because indexing in Python starts at 0. Therefore, adding the length of the `substring` to the start index would point to the character immediately after the `substring`, and subtracting 1 gives the index of the last character of the `substring`.

Since the program handles all potential cases (finding the `substring`, not finding the `substring`, and correctly calculating indices) as described in the problem description, and given that we assume valid input (i.e., both `string` and `substring` are non-empty strings), it is correct according to the specifications provided.
