The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are strings. After executing the function body, the function returns either None or a combination of the substring, its start index in the string, and the index of the last character of the substring in the string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and return either None or the `substring` along with its start and end indices within the `string`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters, string and substring, and returns either None or the substring along with its start and end indices within the string.**
