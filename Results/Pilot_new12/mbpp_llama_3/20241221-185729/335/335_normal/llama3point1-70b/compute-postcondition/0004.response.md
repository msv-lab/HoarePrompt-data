The code `end = start + len(substring)` calculates the index of the position right after the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. 

Given that `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and `start` is not equal to -1, `substring` is found in `string`. 

The value of `end` is `start + len(substring)`, where `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` and `len(substring)` is the length of `substring`. This means `end` is the index of the position immediately after the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `end` is the index of the position right after the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, which is equal to `start + len(substring)`.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `end` is `start + len(substring)`**
