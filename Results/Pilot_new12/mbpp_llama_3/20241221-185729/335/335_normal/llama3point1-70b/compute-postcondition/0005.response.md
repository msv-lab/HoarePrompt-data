To calculate the output state, we consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state includes:
- `string` is a string.
- `substring` is a string.
- `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
- `end` is `start + len(substring)`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
return substring, start, end - 1
```

Based on the initial state and the code snippet:
- `substring` is returned as is, and it is known to be a part of `string`.
- `start` is the index where `substring` first appears in `string`, and it is returned as is.
- `end - 1` is calculated. Since `end` is `start + len(substring)`, subtracting 1 gives us `start + len(substring) - 1`, which is essentially the index of the last character of `substring` in `string`.

Therefore, the program returns `substring` (the string that is found within `string`), `start` (the starting index of `substring` in `string`), and `end - 1` (the index of the last character of `substring` in `string`).

Output State: **The program returns the substring that is part of the string, the start index of this substring in the string, and the index of the last character of the substring in the string**
