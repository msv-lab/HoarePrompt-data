Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with a length of at least 2 and returns a tuple of products of consecutive numbers from `t`, with a length one less than `t`. The input tuple `t` remains unchanged, and the output tuple contains the products of each pair of adjacent numbers in `t`, effectively transforming the input sequence into a new sequence where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the original sequence. The function handles tuples of any length greater than or equal to 2, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than 2 elements, potentially resulting in an error if such a tuple is passed to the function.**
