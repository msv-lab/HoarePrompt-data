Correctness: **True**.

The provided program `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. 

The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` function to achieve this. It iterates over the indices of the input tuple, excluding the last one (since there's no next element to multiply with), and for each index `i`, it multiplies the elements at `i` and `i+1`, effectively fulfilling the problem's requirement.

The given unit tests also validate this behavior, showing that the function correctly handles tuples of varying lengths, including the edge case of a tuple containing a single element, which returns an empty tuple as expected.

Overall, the program is well-written, handles edge cases as described, and meets the specified requirements, making it correct according to the problem description.
