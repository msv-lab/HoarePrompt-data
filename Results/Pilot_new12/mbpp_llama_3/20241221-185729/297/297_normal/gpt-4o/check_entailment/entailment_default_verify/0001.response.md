Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I will maintain the original assessment.

The original assessment is accurate because the provided code correctly implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers `t` as input and returns a new tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, multiplying each element with its next neighbor and storing the results in a new tuple.

The output hints also support the correctness of the program. They indicate that the function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with a length of at least 2 and returns a tuple of products of consecutive numbers from `t`, which is consistent with the problem description. The hints also mention that the input tuple `t` remains unchanged, and the output tuple contains the products of each pair of adjacent numbers in `t`, which is exactly what the code does.

It's worth noting that the output hints mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than 2 elements. However, the problem description does not require the function to handle such cases, and the assumption is that the input will be valid.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
