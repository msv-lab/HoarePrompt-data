Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code correctly implements the required functionality, which is to take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple.

The output hints provide additional insight into the code's functionality, stating that the function accepts a tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2 and returns a tuple of products of consecutive numbers. This aligns with the problem description and the provided code.

However, the output hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than 2 elements, potentially resulting in an error if such a tuple is passed to the function. But, as noted in the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The code correctly handles the edge case of a tuple containing a single element, returning an empty tuple as expected, as demonstrated by the unit test `assert func_1((12,)) == ()`.

Therefore, the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is maintained because the code meets the specified requirements, handles edge cases as described, and the output hints support the correctness of the code.

Final: **True**
