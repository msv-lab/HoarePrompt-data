Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` and returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly this. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple `t`, multiplying each element `t[i]` by the next element `t[i + 1]`. The result is a tuple of these products, which is then returned. 

The length of the output tuple is indeed `N`, where `N` is the length of the input tuple minus one, because the range of the generator expression is `range(len(t) - 1)`.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input tuples.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as specified.
