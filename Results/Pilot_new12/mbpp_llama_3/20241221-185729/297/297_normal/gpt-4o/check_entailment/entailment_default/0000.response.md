Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the described behavior for every potential case. It takes a tuple `t` of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the original tuple, effectively having a length one less than the input tuple. 

The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to create the new tuple. This expression correctly multiplies each element `t[i]` by its next element `t[i + 1]` for indices `i` ranging from `0` to `len(t) - 2`, thus covering all pairs of consecutive elements in the input tuple.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)`, and others, demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various input tuples, including tuples of different lengths.

Moreover, the output hints align with the code's behavior, indicating that it correctly handles tuples of any length greater than or equal to 2 by returning a tuple of products of consecutive numbers. The case where the input tuple has a length of 1, as shown in `assert func_1((12,)) == ()`, is also correctly handled, returning an empty tuple as expected since there are no pairs of consecutive numbers to multiply.

Given the code, the output hints, and the examples provided, it appears that the function works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement, assuming valid input is always provided.
