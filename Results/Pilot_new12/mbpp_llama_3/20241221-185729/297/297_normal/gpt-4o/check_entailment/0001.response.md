Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers `t` as input and returns a new tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, multiplying each element with its next neighbor and storing the results in a new tuple. The `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that the function doesn't go out of bounds when accessing `t[i + 1]`.

The provided unit tests cover various cases, including tuples of different lengths and with different values. The function also correctly handles the edge case where the input tuple has only one element, returning an empty tuple as expected.

Since the function works as expected for all potential cases and edge cases, and the provided unit tests don't reveal any issues, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
