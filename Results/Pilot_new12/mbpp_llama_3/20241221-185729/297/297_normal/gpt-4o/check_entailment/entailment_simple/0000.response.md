Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of products of consecutive numbers from the input tuple.
2. The length of the returned tuple is one less than the length of the input tuple, which matches the problem description.
3. The program uses a generator expression to calculate the products of consecutive numbers, which ensures that the i-th element of the returned tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`, as specified in the problem description.
4. The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different input tuples, including tuples of different lengths and with different values.

The key part of the program that ensures correctness is the line `return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))`. This line uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, multiplying each element with the next one, and returns a tuple of these products. The `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that the loop stops one element before the end of the tuple, avoiding an `IndexError` when accessing `t[i + 1]`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
