Correctness: **True**

I believe the code is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple of length one less than the input, where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the original tuple. 

The code uses a generator expression to calculate the products of consecutive numbers, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this operation. The `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that the function does not go out of bounds when accessing the elements of the tuple.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)`, demonstrate that the function works correctly for tuples of different lengths. Additionally, the test `assert func_1((12,)) == ()` shows that the function handles the case where the input tuple has only one element, returning an empty tuple as expected.

The output hints also agree with the code, describing the function's behavior and noting that it does not perform error checking for tuples with less than 2 elements. However, since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

Overall, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements for every potential case.
