Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element and the next one in the input tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

* The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` expression pairs each element in the input tuple with the next one. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, `zip` will produce pairs `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 4)`.
* The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` computes the product of each pair.
* The `tuple(...)` function converts the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned by the `func_1` function.

I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs where the code wouldn't work as expected. For example:

* An empty input tuple: The function will return an empty tuple, which is the correct result.
* A tuple with one element: The function will return an empty tuple, which is the correct result since there are no pairs to multiply.
* A tuple with multiple elements: The function will correctly compute the products of each pair and return them as a tuple.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any cases where it wouldn't work as expected.
