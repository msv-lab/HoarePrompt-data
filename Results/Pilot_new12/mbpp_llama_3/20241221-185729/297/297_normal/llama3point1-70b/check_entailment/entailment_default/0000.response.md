Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input, multiplies each number with its successor, and returns a tuple containing these products. The function utilizes the `zip` function to pair each number with its next number in the tuple, and a generator expression to calculate the products.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior. The function handles tuples with at least two elements and returns a tuple with one less element than the input tuple, as expected.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input tuple has less than two elements or contains non-numeric values. Under the assumption of valid input, the function will always produce the correct output.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function will correctly return `(2, 6, 12)`, which is the tuple containing the products of successive pairs of numbers in the input tuple. This behavior matches the problem description, and the function will work as expected for any valid input tuple.
