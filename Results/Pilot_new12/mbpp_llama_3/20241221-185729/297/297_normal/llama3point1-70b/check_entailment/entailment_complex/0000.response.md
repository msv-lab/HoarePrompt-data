Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input, computes the products of successive pairs of numbers, and returns these products as a tuple with one less element than the input tuple.

The use of the `zip` function in combination with list comprehension (`tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))`) ensures that each element in the input tuple is multiplied by the next one, exactly as specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` will pair the elements as follows: `(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)`, and then the list comprehension will compute the products, resulting in the tuple `(2, 6, 12)`.

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a tuple of numbers with at least two elements and containing only numbers) justifies not including error checking code for handling invalid inputs, as per the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description for all valid inputs.
