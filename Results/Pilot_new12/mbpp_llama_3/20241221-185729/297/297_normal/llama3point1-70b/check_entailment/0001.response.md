Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The `zip` function is used to pair each element in the input tuple with the next element. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, `zip` will produce pairs `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 4)`.
2. The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` multiplies each pair of elements together, producing the desired products.
3. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty input tuples (although this is not explicitly stated in the problem description, the program will raise an error in this case, which is a reasonable behavior).
* Input tuples with a single element (the program will return an empty tuple, which is a reasonable behavior).
* Input tuples with multiple elements (the program will correctly compute the products of consecutive elements).

Since the program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
