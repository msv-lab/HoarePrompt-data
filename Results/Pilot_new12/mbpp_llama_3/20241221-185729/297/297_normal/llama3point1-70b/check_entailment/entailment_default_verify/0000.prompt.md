You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element and the next one in the input tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

* The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` expression pairs each element in the input tuple with the next one. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, `zip` will produce pairs `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 4)`.
* The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` computes the product of each pair.
* The `tuple(...)` function converts the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned by the `func_1` function.

I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs where the code wouldn't work as expected. For example:

* An empty input tuple: The function will return an empty tuple, which is the correct result.
* A tuple with one element: The function will return an empty tuple, which is the correct result since there are no pairs to multiply.
* A tuple with multiple elements: The function will correctly compute the products of each pair and return them as a tuple.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any cases where it wouldn't work as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a tuple containing the products of successive pairs of numbers. The returned tuple has one less element than the input tuple. For example, if the input tuple is (1, 2, 3, 4), the function will return (1*2, 2*3, 3*4) = (2, 6, 12). The function does not modify the original input tuple and does not handle cases where the input tuple has less than 2 elements, as it will result in an error. The function assumes that the input tuple only contains numbers and will throw an error if the tuple contains non-numeric values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
