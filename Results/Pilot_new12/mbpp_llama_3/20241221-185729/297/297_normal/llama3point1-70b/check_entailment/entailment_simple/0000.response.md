Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

- The problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` as input and returns a tuple of length `N`.
- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` as input and uses the `zip` function to pair each element `a` with the next element `b` in the tuple.
- The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` expression effectively pairs `t_i` with `t_{i+1}` for `i` ranging from `1` to `N`.
- The tuple comprehension `(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` then computes the product of each pair, resulting in a tuple containing `t_1 * t_2, t_2 * t_3,..., t_N * t_{N+1}`.
- Finally, the `tuple` function is used to convert the result into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.
- The length of the returned tuple is `N`, which is one less than the length of the input tuple `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})`, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is verified.
