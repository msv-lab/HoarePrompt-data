Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. 

The code uses the built-in `zip` function to pair each number in the input tuple with the next one, and a generator expression to calculate the products of these pairs. The result is then converted to a tuple and returned.

The output hints match the code's behavior, and the examples provided are consistent with the problem description. The program assumes that the input tuple only contains numbers, which is in line with the problem description.

The only potential issue is that the program will throw an error if the input tuple has less than 2 elements, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not considered a case where the program does not work correctly. 

Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **True**.
