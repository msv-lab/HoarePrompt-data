The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. After re-examining the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the problem description by taking a tuple of numbers and returning a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element and the next one in the input tuple.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program before the function call and after the return statement. The annotation before the function call states that `numbers` is a tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description. The annotation after the return statement correctly describes the returned tuple as containing the products of successive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `numbers`, with one less element than `numbers`.

The code's correctness can be verified by analyzing the `zip` function's behavior and the generator expression's computation. The `zip` function pairs each element in the input tuple with the next one, and the generator expression computes the product of each pair. The `tuple` function then converts the generator expression into a tuple, which is returned by the `func_1` function.

The original assessment also considers edge cases, such as an empty input tuple or a tuple with one element, and concludes that the code handles these cases correctly. Although the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, the code's behavior is still correct for valid inputs.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True**.

Final: **True**
