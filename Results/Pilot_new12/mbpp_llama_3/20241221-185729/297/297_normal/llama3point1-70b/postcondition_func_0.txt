The function accepts a tuple of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a tuple containing the products of successive pairs of numbers. The returned tuple has one less element than the input tuple. For example, if the input tuple is (1, 2, 3, 4), the function will return (1*2, 2*3, 3*4) = (2, 6, 12). The function does not modify the original input tuple and does not handle cases where the input tuple has less than 2 elements, as it will result in an error. The function assumes that the input tuple only contains numbers and will throw an error if the tuple contains non-numeric values.
