Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number has 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function then checks if the input month is in this set.

The unit tests provided also validate the function's behavior. For example, `func_1(5)` returns `True` because May has 31 days, and `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February does not have 31 days.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles all possible month inputs (1-12) and returns the expected result.

The code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description, which is to determine whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The use of a set to store the months with 31 days allows for efficient lookup, and the function's logic is straightforward and easy to follow.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
