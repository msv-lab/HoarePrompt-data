You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number has 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function then checks if the input month is in this set.

The unit tests provided also validate the function's behavior. For example, `func_1(5)` returns `True` because May has 31 days, and `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February does not have 31 days.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles all possible month inputs (1-12) and returns the expected result.

The code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description, which is to determine whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The use of a set to store the months with 31 days allows for efficient lookup, and the function's logic is straightforward and easy to follow.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter `month` between 1 and 12, representing a month of the year, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days. It returns `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for months 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `month`, so it assumes the input will always be a valid month between 1 and 12. If the input `month` is outside this range or not an integer, the function's behavior is undefined. The function's purpose is to determine if a given month has 31 days, and it affects no external state beyond its return value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
