The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number has 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function then checks if the input month is in this set.

The unit tests provided also validate the function's behavior. For example, `func_1(5)` returns `True` because May has 31 days, and `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February does not have 31 days.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for months with fewer days. The hints also note that the function does not perform any error checking on the input, but this is not considered an issue given the assumption that the input will always be a valid month between 1 and 12.

The function accurately implements the problem description, which is to determine whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The use of a set to store the months with 31 days allows for efficient lookup, and the function's logic is straightforward and easy to follow.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.

Final: **True**
