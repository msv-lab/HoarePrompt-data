Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct. The function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then checks if the input month is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all included in the `months_with_31_days` set.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the program. For example, `func_1(5)` returns `True` because May has 31 days, and `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February has less than 31 days.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, so I conclude that it is correct.
