Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The set contains the months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, which are the months that have 31 days in a year. The function then checks if the input `month` is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for months 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function's purpose is to determine if a given month has 31 days, and it does so correctly for all valid month inputs between 1 and 12.

The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the function, showing that it returns the expected results for different month inputs. Since the input is assumed to be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's lack of error checking on the input `month` does not affect its correctness. Overall, the code correctly implements the described functionality and works as expected for all potential cases.
