Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` achieves this by defining a set `months_with_31_days` that includes the month numbers that have 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). The function then checks if the input `month` is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function by checking its output for different month numbers. The function passes all these tests, which confirms its correctness.

The function assumes that the input will be a valid month number between 1 and 12, as specified in the problem description. Under this assumption, the function will always correctly determine whether the given month has 31 days or not. 

In particular, the function handles all possible cases:

- For months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the function returns `True`.
- For months without 31 days (2, 4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
