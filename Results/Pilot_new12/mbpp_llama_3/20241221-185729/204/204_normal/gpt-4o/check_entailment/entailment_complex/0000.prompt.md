You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, representing a month of the year.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if the month has 31 days (for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), and False otherwise (for months 2, 4, 6, 9, 11)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month` between 1 and 12, representing a month of the year, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days. It returns `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for months 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `month`, so it assumes the input will always be a valid month between 1 and 12. If the input `month` is outside this range or not an integer, the function's behavior is undefined. The function's purpose is to determine if a given month has 31 days, and it affects no external state beyond its return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
