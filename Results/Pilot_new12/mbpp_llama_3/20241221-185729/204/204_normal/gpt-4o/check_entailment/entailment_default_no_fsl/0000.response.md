Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month has 31 days by looking up the month number in a set of months that have 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` contains the numbers of months that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The function correctly returns `True` for these months and `False` for the remaining months (February, April, June, September, and November), as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` otherwise.

Since we assume that the input will be a valid month between 1 and 12, we do not need to consider cases where the input is outside this range or not an integer. Under these assumptions, the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
