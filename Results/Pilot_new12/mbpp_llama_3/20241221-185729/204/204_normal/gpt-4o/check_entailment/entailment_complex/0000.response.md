Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input, representing a month of the year, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days. 

The function uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the months that have 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12). It then checks if the input `month` is in this set, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. This logic is consistent with the problem description, which asks for a function to determine whether a given month number contains 31 days or not.

Since we assume that the input will always be a valid month between 1 and 12, the function's lack of error checking does not affect its correctness. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
