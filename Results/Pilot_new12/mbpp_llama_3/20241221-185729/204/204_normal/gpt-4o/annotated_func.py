#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, representing a month of the year.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if the month has 31 days (for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), and False otherwise (for months 2, 4, 6, 9, 11)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month` between 1 and 12, representing a month of the year, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days. It returns `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for months 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `month`, so it assumes the input will always be a valid month between 1 and 12. If the input `month` is outside this range or not an integer, the function's behavior is undefined. The function's purpose is to determine if a given month has 31 days, and it affects no external state beyond its return value.
