Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given month number `n` contains 31 days or not. It uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list using the `in` operator.

This function works correctly for all possible inputs. For example:

- If `n` is 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), or 12 (December), the function returns `True`, indicating that these months have 31 days.
- If `n` is 2 (February), 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), or 11 (November), the function returns `False`, indicating that these months do not have 31 days.
- The function also correctly handles invalid inputs, such as `n` being 0 or a negative number, or `n` being greater than 12. In these cases, the function returns `False`, which is correct because these inputs do not correspond to valid months.

Overall, the function is simple and effective, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
