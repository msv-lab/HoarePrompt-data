Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It does this by defining a list `months_31_days` that includes the month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) which are known to have 31 days in the Gregorian calendar. The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, indicating that the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

This function correctly handles every potential case as described in the problem. It correctly identifies months with 31 days and returns `False` for months with fewer days. It also implicitly handles invalid month numbers (those outside the range 1 to 12) by returning `False` since such numbers are not in the `months_31_days` list.

To verify its correctness, consider the following potential cases:
- For months known to have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December), the function correctly returns `True`.
- For months known not to have 31 days (February, April, June, September, and November), the function correctly returns `False`.
- For any invalid month number (less than 1 or greater than 12), the function will return `False`, aligning with the problem's implicit expectation that only valid month numbers are considered.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly according to the problem description and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it fails to handle, it is considered correct.
