To evaluate the correctness of the program, we need to consider the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` is correct because it correctly identifies months with 31 days and handles invalid inputs by returning `False` for them.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by providing the state of the program before the function call and the function's return value. It states that the input `n` is an integer and represents a month of the year (1 <= n <= 12), and the function returns `True` if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days and `False` otherwise.

Given this information, the original assessment makes sense. The function correctly implements the required functionality by checking if the input month number `n` is in the list of months with 31 days. The annotated version also confirms that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, where 1 <= n <= 12.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program is correct. The original assessment is accurate because the function correctly identifies months with 31 days and handles valid inputs as expected.

Final: **True**
