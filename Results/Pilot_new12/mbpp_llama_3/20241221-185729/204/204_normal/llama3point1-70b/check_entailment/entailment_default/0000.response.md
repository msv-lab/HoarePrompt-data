Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the month number, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days. The function uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function will return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise. The function considers all 12 months of the year and accounts for the varying lengths of months.

The code handles all potential cases correctly. For example, if the input is 1 (January), the function will return `True` because January has 31 days. If the input is 2 (February), the function will return `False` because February has 28 or 29 days. The function will work correctly for all month numbers from 1 to 12.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a positive integer between 1 and 12. Therefore, the code is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
