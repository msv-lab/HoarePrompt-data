Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Alignment**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. This directly aligns with the problem description, indicating that the function meets the requirements specified.

2. **Correct Logic**: The function uses a list `months_31_days` that includes all the month numbers known to have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). It then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. This logic correctly identifies months with 31 days and those without.

3. **Handling of Invalid Inputs**: Although the problem assumes valid inputs (month numbers between 1 and 12), the function inherently handles invalid inputs (numbers outside the range 1 to 12) by returning `False` for such cases since these numbers are not in the `months_31_days` list. This behavior aligns with the expected handling of invalid month numbers.

4. **Annotated Version Support**: The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the original assessment. It clearly states that the function returns `True` if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days and `False` otherwise, where `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 12`. This annotation confirms that the function behaves as expected for all valid month inputs.

5. **Comprehensive Handling**: The function comprehensively handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It correctly identifies months with 31 days, returns `False` for months with fewer days, and implicitly handles invalid month numbers by returning `False` since these are not present in the `months_31_days` list.

Given the alignment with the problem description, the correct logic used, the handling of invalid inputs, the support from the annotated version, and the comprehensive handling of all potential cases, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is maintained.

Final: **True**
