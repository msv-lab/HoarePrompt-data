Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. 

In the given function, `func_1(n)`, a list `months_31_days` is created to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, indicating that the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all possible cases of month numbers from 1 to 12, as specified in the state of the program before the function call. For instance, when `n` is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, the function returns `True` because these months have 31 days. For other month numbers (2, 4, 6, 9, and 11), the function returns `False`, which is also correct because these months do not have 31 days.

Since the function accurately identifies which months have 31 days and returns the correct boolean value for all valid input month numbers, it meets the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the program's correctness is verified as **True**.
