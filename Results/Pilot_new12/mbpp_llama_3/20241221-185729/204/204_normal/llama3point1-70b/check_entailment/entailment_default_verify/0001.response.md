The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(n)` accurately identifies whether a given month number `n` has 31 days by checking if `n` is in the list `months_31_days`, which contains the month numbers known to have 31 days in the Gregorian calendar.

The output hints support the correctness of the program by describing its functionality in alignment with the problem description. They indicate that the function takes an integer `n` as input where 1 <= n <= 12 and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days, which matches the implementation and purpose of `func_1(n)`.

Given the assumptions provided, such as valid input (1 <= n <= 12) and no consideration for errors resulting from invalid inputs (like non-integer or out-of-range values), the program is designed to handle all valid month numbers correctly. It correctly classifies months based on whether they have 31 days, aligning with the Gregorian calendar's definition of month lengths.

The reasoning behind maintaining the original assessment as **True** includes:
1. The function correctly implements the logic for determining if a month has 31 days based on the Gregorian calendar.
2. The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior and match its implementation.
3. The program handles all specified cases for valid month numbers as per the problem description.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion is that the program is correct as per the problem description and the output hints provided.

Final: **True**
