You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given month number `n` contains 31 days or not. It uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list using the `in` operator.

This function works correctly for all possible inputs. For example:

- If `n` is 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), or 12 (December), the function returns `True`, indicating that these months have 31 days.
- If `n` is 2 (February), 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), or 11 (November), the function returns `False`, indicating that these months do not have 31 days.
- The function also correctly handles invalid inputs, such as `n` being 0 or a negative number, or `n` being greater than 12. In these cases, the function returns `False`, which is correct because these inputs do not correspond to valid months.

Overall, the function is simple and effective, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function determines whether a given month of the year has 31 days, taking an integer `n` as input where 1 <= n <= 12, and returns a boolean value indicating True if the month has 31 days and False otherwise, thus providing a clear classification of months based on the number of days they contain. The function considers all 12 months of the year, accounting for the varying lengths of months, and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the presence of `n` in the predefined list of months with 31 days.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
