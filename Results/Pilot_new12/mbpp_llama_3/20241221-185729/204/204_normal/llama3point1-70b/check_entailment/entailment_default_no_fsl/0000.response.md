Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It does this by defining a list `months_31_days` that includes the month numbers of those months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function then checks if the input month number `n` is present in this list, returning `True` if it is (indicating the month has 31 days) and `False` otherwise.

Given the problem description and the function's implementation, the code correctly handles every potential case as described. The function accounts for all 12 months of the year, classifying them based on whether they have 31 days or not, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints further support this by explaining the function's behavior across different months, indicating it behaves as expected for all possible inputs (1 <= n <= 12).

Since we assume the input will always be valid (in this case, a positive integer between 1 and 12 inclusive), the function is designed to handle such inputs correctly. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that the function fails to address, leading to the conclusion that the function is correct for all intended use cases.
