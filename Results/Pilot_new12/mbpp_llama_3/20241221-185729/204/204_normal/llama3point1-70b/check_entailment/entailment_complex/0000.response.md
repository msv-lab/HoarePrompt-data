Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` representing a month of the year, where `1 <= n <= 12`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a predefined list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days.
2. The function uses the `in` operator to check if the input month number `n` is present in the `months_31_days` list.
3. If `n` is found in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
4. The program considers all 12 months of the year and accounts for the varying lengths of months, as required by the problem description.

Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 12`), the program will always return the correct result. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
