#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and 1 <= n <= 12, representing a month of the year.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days, False otherwise, where `n` is an integer and 1 <= n <= 12
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given month of the year has 31 days, taking an integer `n` as input where 1 <= n <= 12, and returns a boolean value indicating True if the month has 31 days and False otherwise, thus providing a clear classification of months based on the number of days they contain. The function considers all 12 months of the year, accounting for the varying lengths of months, and returns the appropriate boolean value based on the presence of `n` in the predefined list of months with 31 days.
