The value of `n` can be any integer from 1 to 12. The list `months_31_days` contains the month numbers that have 31 days in a year, which are [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]. 

The program checks if `n` is in the list `months_31_days`. If `n` is one of the month numbers in the list, the program returns `True`, indicating that the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days. If `n` is not in the list, the program returns `False`, indicating that the month corresponding to `n` does not have 31 days.

Since `n` can be any integer from 1 to 12, the possible values of `n` that are in `months_31_days` are 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and the possible values of `n` that are not in `months_31_days` are 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days, False otherwise, where `n` is an integer and 1 <= n <= 12**
