The variable `months_31_days` is assigned a list of integers representing the months with 31 days. The initial state of `n` is still valid, which is an integer and 1 <= n <= 12. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` can have 12 different values, it can be in `months_31_days` or not. The value of `n` is between 1 and 12 inclusive, and this information is still valid, so we just need to consider what the new defined variable is.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 1 <= n <= 12, `months_31_days` is a list of month numbers with 31 days in a year which is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= n <= 12, `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
