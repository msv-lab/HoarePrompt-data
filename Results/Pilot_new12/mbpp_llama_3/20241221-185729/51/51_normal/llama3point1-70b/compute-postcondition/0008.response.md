To calculate the result of the given Python code snippet, we need to understand the initial state and how it affects the outcome.

Given:
- `numbers` is a list of numbers.
- `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list.
- `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.

The code snippet is `return product / len(numbers)`.

This means we are dividing the product of all numbers in the list by the total count of numbers in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the average of all numbers in the `numbers` list, where the average is calculated as the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list**
