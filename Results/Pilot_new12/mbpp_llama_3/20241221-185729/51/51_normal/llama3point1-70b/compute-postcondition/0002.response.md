The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. The initial value of `product` is 1 and `num` is the first number in the list. 

So, the new value of `product` is 1 * `num`, which is equal to the first number in the list. 

The state of `numbers` is not affected, and `num` is still the first number in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least one element, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list**
