The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Initially, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, and `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list. 

So, the new value of `product` is the first number in the `numbers` list multiplied by the second number in the `numbers` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 2 elements, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 2 elements, `product` is equal to `numbers[0]` * `numbers[1]`, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list**
