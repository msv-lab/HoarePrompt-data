The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num`. The initial value of `product` is `numbers[0]` * `numbers[1]`, and `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list, i.e., `numbers[2]`. 

So, after executing the code, `product` becomes (`numbers[0]` * `numbers[1]`) * `numbers[2]`, which can be simplified to `numbers[0]` * `numbers[1]` * `numbers[2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 elements, `product` is equal to `numbers[0]` * `numbers[1]` * `numbers[2]`, `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 elements, `product` is equal to `numbers[0]` * `numbers[1]` * `numbers[2]`, `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list**
