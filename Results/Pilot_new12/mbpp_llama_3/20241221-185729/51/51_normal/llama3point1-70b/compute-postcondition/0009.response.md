The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats, and must contain at least one element. After executing the function body, the function returns the average of all numbers in the `numbers` list. The average is calculated as the sum of all numbers is not used, instead, the product of all numbers is divided by the count of numbers in the list. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers and return the average of these numbers, where the average is the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list.**
