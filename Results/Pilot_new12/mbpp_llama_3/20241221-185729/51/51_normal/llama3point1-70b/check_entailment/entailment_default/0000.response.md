Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not handle the case when the input list is empty. In this case, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError because it attempts to divide by the length of the list, which is zero. Additionally, the code does not handle the case when the list contains a zero. Although this will not result in an error, it may not be the desired behavior as the function will return zero, which might not be what the user expects when calculating the geometric mean.

To make the code correct, it should include error checking to handle these edge cases. For example, it could check if the list is empty before attempting to calculate the geometric mean and return a specific value or raise an exception in this case. Similarly, it could check if the list contains a zero and handle this case accordingly. 

It's also worth noting that the function's purpose is to calculate the geometric mean of a list of numbers, which is a statistical measure that is sensitive to extreme values (like zero). So, even if the code is correct in terms of not throwing errors, its output might not be meaningful or useful in certain cases, like when the list contains a zero.
