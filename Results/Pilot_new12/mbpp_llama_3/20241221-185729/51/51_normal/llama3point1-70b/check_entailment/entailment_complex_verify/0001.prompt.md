You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by the length of the list, which is zero. This is because the problem description does not specify what to do in this case, but the function should at least handle this edge case to be considered correct. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the function will raise an error instead of returning a meaningful result or handling the case explicitly. 

Additionally, the function does not check if the input list contains non-numeric values. If the list contains strings or other non-numeric types, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to multiply them. 

To make the function correct, it should add error checking to handle these edge cases, such as checking if the list is empty or if it contains non-numeric values. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None  # or any other meaningful result for an empty list
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("The list must only contain numbers")
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all numbers in the `numbers` list, where the average is calculated as the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the geometric mean of all numbers in the list, which is the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list. However, from the user's perspective, this calculation does not accurately represent an average, but rather a specialized operation. The function does not handle potential edge cases, such as an empty list, which would cause a division by zero error, or a list containing zero, which would result in a product of zero regardless of other numbers in the list. After the function concludes, it returns a single value representing the result of this calculation, leaving the input list unchanged. The function's purpose appears to be calculating a specific statistical measure, but its implementation may not align with standard mathematical definitions of averages or means.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
