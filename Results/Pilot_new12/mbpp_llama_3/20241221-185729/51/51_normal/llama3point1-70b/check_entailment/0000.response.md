Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. In such a case, the `len(numbers)` function will return 0, and attempting to divide by zero will result in a ZeroDivisionError. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the program will throw an error because it attempts to divide by zero.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the list contains a zero. In such a case, the product will be zero, and the result of the division will depend on the length of the list and the presence of zero in the list, but the function does not check for this edge case.

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to handle these edge cases. For example, it could check if the list is empty before attempting to divide, and it could handle the case when the list contains a zero by checking if the product is zero before attempting to divide. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to handle these edge cases:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0  # or any other default value
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    if product == 0:
        return 0
    return product / len(numbers)
```
