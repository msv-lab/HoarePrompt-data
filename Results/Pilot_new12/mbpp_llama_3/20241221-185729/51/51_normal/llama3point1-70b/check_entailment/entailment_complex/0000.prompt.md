You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all numbers in the `numbers` list, where the average is calculated as the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the geometric mean of all numbers in the list, which is the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list. However, from the user's perspective, this calculation does not accurately represent an average, but rather a specialized operation. The function does not handle potential edge cases, such as an empty list, which would cause a division by zero error, or a list containing zero, which would result in a product of zero regardless of other numbers in the list. After the function concludes, it returns a single value representing the result of this calculation, leaving the input list unchanged. The function's purpose appears to be calculating a specific statistical measure, but its implementation may not align with standard mathematical definitions of averages or means.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
