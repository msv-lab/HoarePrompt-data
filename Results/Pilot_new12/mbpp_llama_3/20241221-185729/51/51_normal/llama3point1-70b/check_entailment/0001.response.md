Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by the length of the list, which is zero. This is because the problem description does not specify what to do in this case, but the function should at least handle this edge case to be considered correct. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the function will raise an error instead of returning a meaningful result or handling the case explicitly. 

Additionally, the function does not check if the input list contains non-numeric values. If the list contains strings or other non-numeric types, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to multiply them. 

To make the function correct, it should add error checking to handle these edge cases, such as checking if the list is empty or if it contains non-numeric values. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None  # or any other meaningful result for an empty list
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("The list must only contain numbers")
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```
