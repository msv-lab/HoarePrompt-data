Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of an empty list, which would cause a division by zero error. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. However, if the list is empty, the length of the list is zero, and division by zero is undefined. 

Additionally, the program does not explicitly handle the case where the list contains a zero. Although the product of the numbers in the list will be zero if the list contains a zero, this is mathematically correct. However, the presence of a zero does not make the function incorrect. 

The function also assumes that the input is a list of numbers, but it does not check for this. However, according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid, so we do not need to consider this case. 

But in the case of an empty list, the program will encounter a ZeroDivisionError, which indicates that the program does not work correctly for every potential case, as described in the problem.
