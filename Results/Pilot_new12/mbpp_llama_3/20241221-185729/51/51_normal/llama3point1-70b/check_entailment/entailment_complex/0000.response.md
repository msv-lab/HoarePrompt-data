Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. The provided program does exactly this:

1. It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
2. It iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`, multiplying `product` by each number.
3. After the loop, `product` contains the product of all numbers in the list.
4. The program then returns the result of dividing `product` by the length of the list `numbers`.

This sequence of operations directly implements the calculation described in the problem description. The program does not need to handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list containing zero, as the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 

However, it's worth noting that the term "average" is typically used to describe the arithmetic mean, not the geometric mean, which is what this program calculates. But based strictly on the mathematical operation described in the problem (multiplying all numbers in a list and dividing by the length of the list), the program is correct.
