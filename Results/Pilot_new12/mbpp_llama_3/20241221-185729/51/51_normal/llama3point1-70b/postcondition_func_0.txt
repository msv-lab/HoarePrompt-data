The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the geometric mean of all numbers in the list, which is the product of all numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list. However, from the user's perspective, this calculation does not accurately represent an average, but rather a specialized operation. The function does not handle potential edge cases, such as an empty list, which would cause a division by zero error, or a list containing zero, which would result in a product of zero regardless of other numbers in the list. After the function concludes, it returns a single value representing the result of this calculation, leaving the input list unchanged. The function's purpose appears to be calculating a specific statistical measure, but its implementation may not align with standard mathematical definitions of averages or means.
