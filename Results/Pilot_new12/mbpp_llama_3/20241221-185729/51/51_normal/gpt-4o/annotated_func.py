#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats), `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of all numbers in the list divided by the count of numbers in the list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the geometric mean of a list of numbers, which is the product of all numbers in the list divided by the count of numbers in the list. It accepts a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element and returns a single number. Note that if the input list is empty, the function will result in a ZeroDivisionError because it attempts to divide by the length of the list, which would be zero. Additionally, if the product of the numbers in the list is zero, the function will return zero. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric values, which could result in a TypeError. The state of the input list remains unchanged after the function call.
