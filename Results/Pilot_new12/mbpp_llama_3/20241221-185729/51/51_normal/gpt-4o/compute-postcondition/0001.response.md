According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop can execute. Since `numbers` is already stated to have at least one element, this condition is met. For the loop to start executing, `num` should be the first number in the `numbers` list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element, `product` is 1, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list**
