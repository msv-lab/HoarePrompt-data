To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state is: `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element, `product` is 1, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list.

Given the code:
```python
product *= num
```
This code multiplies the current value of `product` by `num` and assigns the result back to `product`. 

Since `product` is initially 1 and `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list, after the execution of the code, `product` will be equal to the first number in the `numbers` list (because 1 multiplied by any number is that number itself).

The states of `numbers` and the fact that `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list are not affected by the code. Only the value of `product` changes.

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list**
