To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is designed to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list and multiply the current `product` by that number. 

Given the Output States after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe a pattern:
- After 1 iteration, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list.
- After 2 iterations, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list.
- After 3 iterations, the pattern suggests that `product` would be equal to the product of the first three numbers in the `numbers` list, although the description seems to be incomplete, it implies a multiplication of all previous numbers.

This pattern indicates that after all iterations, `product` will be the result of multiplying all numbers in the `numbers` list together.

If the list `numbers` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `product` will remain 1, which is the multiplicative identity and thus the product of no numbers.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios, including the case where the loop does not execute (which, based on the initial state, is not possible since `numbers` must have at least one element), the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats), `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.**
