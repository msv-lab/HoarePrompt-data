The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num`. Given that `product` is initially equal to `numbers[0] * numbers[1]` and `num` is the second element in the `numbers` list, which means `num = numbers[1]`, we can calculate the new value of `product`.

Initially, `product = numbers[0] * numbers[1]`. After executing `product *= num`, the new value of `product` becomes `product = (numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[1]`. This simplifies to `product = numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[1]` or `product = numbers[0] * (numbers[1] ** 2)`.

The value of `numbers` and `num` remains unchanged as the code only modifies the `product` variable.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least two elements, `product` is equal to `numbers[0] * (numbers[1] ** 2)`, `num` is the second element in the `numbers` list**
