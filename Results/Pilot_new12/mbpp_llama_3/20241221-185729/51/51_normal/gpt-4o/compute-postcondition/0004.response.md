The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Initially, `product` is the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, and `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list. 

So, if the first two numbers in the list are `numbers[0]` and `numbers[1]`, then `product` is initially `numbers[0] * numbers[1]`, and `num` is `numbers[1]`. 

After executing the code, `product` becomes `product * num`, which is `(numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[1]`. This can be simplified to `numbers[0] * (numbers[1] ** 2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least two elements, `product` is equal to the product of the first number and the square of the second number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least two elements, `product` is equal to `numbers[0] * (numbers[1] ** 2)`, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list**
