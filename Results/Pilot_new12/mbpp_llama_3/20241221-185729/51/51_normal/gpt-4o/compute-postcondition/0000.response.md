The code initializes a variable `product` to 1. The initial state of `numbers` remains unchanged, as the code only introduces a new variable `product` without modifying the existing `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element, `product` is 1**
