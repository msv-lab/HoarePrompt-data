Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It calculates the product of all numbers in a list and then divides the product by the length of the list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1` initializes a variable `product` to 1, which is the multiplicative identity. This ensures that the product of all numbers in the list is calculated correctly.

2. The function then iterates over each number in the input list, multiplying the current `product` by the number.

3. After calculating the product, the function divides it by the length of the input list using the `len` function.

4. The result is then returned by the function.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, indicating that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases.

The code handles the multiplication and division correctly for both positive and negative numbers, as well as for lists of varying lengths. Additionally, it does not have any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, such as division by zero (since the length of a list is always at least 1, unless the list is empty, and the function does not explicitly handle this case but will raise a ZeroDivisionError which could be considered as correct because an empty list does not have a well-defined product or average). However, in a real-world scenario, you might want to add error checking to handle such edge cases.

In summary, based on the provided code and problem description, the program appears to be correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
