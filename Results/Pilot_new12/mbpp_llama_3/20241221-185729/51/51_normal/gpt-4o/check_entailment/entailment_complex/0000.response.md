Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description. The problem statement asks to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the result by the length of the list. 

In the given annotated program, the function `func_1` does exactly that: it first calculates the product of all numbers in the input list using a for loop, and then it divides this product by the length of the list.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers), the function will always produce the correct result as per the problem description. It correctly handles the multiplication of all numbers and then divides the result by the count of numbers, which is exactly what the problem statement requires. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential valid input cases.
