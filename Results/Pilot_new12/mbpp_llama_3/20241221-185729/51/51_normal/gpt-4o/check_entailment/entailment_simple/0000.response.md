Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, multiplies all the numbers in the list, and then divides the result by the length of the list. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The function initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all numbers in the list.
2. The function then iterates over each number in the list using a `for` loop, multiplying the current `product` by each number.
3. After the loop has finished, the function divides the `product` by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`.
4. The result is then returned by the function.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result of the function with the expected result, allowing for a small amount of floating point error.

Since the program does what the problem description asks for, and there are no potential cases where it would not follow the problem description (given the assumption that the input will be valid), the correctness of the program is **True**.
