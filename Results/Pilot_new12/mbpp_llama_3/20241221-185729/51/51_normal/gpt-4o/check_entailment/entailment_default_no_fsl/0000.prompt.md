You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result


```
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the geometric mean of a list of numbers, which is the product of all numbers in the list divided by the count of numbers in the list. It accepts a list of numbers (either integers or floats) with at least one element and returns a single number. Note that if the input list is empty, the function will result in a ZeroDivisionError because it attempts to divide by the length of the list, which would be zero. Additionally, if the product of the numbers in the list is zero, the function will return zero. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric values, which could result in a TypeError. The state of the input list remains unchanged after the function call.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
