Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says, which is to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. The function `func_1` correctly implements this by initializing a product variable to 1, then iterating over each number in the input list, multiplying the product by each number. After calculating the product, it divides the product by the length of the list, effectively calculating the geometric mean.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can disregard potential edge cases such as an empty list, non-numeric values, or non-list input. The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various valid inputs, including positive and negative numbers. The function correctly handles cases where the product of the numbers in the list is zero, returning zero as expected.

The problem description and the code implementation align, and the provided unit tests support the correctness of the function for valid inputs. Therefore, under the assumption of valid input, the function correctly implements the described functionality.
