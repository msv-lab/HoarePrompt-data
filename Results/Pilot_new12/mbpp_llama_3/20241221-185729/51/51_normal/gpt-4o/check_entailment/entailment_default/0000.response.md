Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function calculates the product of all numbers in the input list and then divides it by the length of the list, which is equivalent to calculating the arithmetic mean of the product of all numbers, not exactly the geometric mean as mentioned in the output hints, but rather it seems the output hints might contain an error since the geometric mean would need the nth root where n is the length of the numbers. However, given that the function indeed multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides by the length of the list as per the problem description, the code works as expected. The output hints also suggest that it handles cases with both positive and negative numbers, as well as cases where the product of the numbers in the list is zero. The assumptions that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers) aligns with the problem statement, and under these assumptions, the function operates correctly for every potential case. 

Please note the output hints description contains the term geometric mean which in math would be the nth root of the product of all the numbers, however since the actual function provided in the code indeed does what the problem description asks which is to multiply all the numbers and divide by the length of the list it would be the arithmetic mean of the product which still seems the program works correctly for the given problem description and assumptions. 

However, if we take the term in the output hints literally (geometric mean), the function provided would indeed be incorrect, but given that all the test cases and the problem description seem to be asking for different operations (i.e., multiplication before dividing) we assume that the term geometric mean in the hints is incorrect and the actual intention was multiplication followed by division to obtain the average of all multiplied numbers.
