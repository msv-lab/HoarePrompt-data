Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`, which returns `True` if the element is an integer and `False` otherwise. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in a numeric context, the `sum` function effectively counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list.

The function handles various potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: It correctly returns 0, as there are no integer elements.
- Lists with only integer elements: It correctly counts all elements as integers.
- Lists with a mix of integer and non-integer elements: It correctly counts only the integer elements.
- Lists with no integer elements: It correctly returns 0, indicating no integer elements are present.

Without a specific case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
