Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in the list. 

The function uses a generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. The `isinstance(x, int)` function checks if `x` is an integer, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up these boolean values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

This solution works for every potential case, as long as the input is a valid list, which is assumed according to the problem statement. It correctly handles lists containing a mix of integers and other types, as well as empty lists, returning 0 in the latter case. 

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 'a', 3, 4.5]`, the function will return `3`, because there are three integer elements in the list. If `lst = []`, the function will return `0`, because there are no integer elements in an empty list. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is verified.
