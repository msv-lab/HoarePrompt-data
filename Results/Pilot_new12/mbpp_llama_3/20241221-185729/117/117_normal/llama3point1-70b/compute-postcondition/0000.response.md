The given code snippet calculates the sum of instances where an element `x` in the list `lst` is an integer. 

Since `lst` is a list and it can contain any type of elements (integers, floats, strings, etc.), the `isinstance(x, int)` function checks each element in the list to see if it's an integer. If an element is an integer, `isinstance(x, int)` returns `True`, which is equivalent to 1 when summed. If an element is not an integer, `isinstance(x, int)` returns `False`, which is equivalent to 0 when summed.

The `sum` function then adds up all these `True` (1) and `False` (0) values, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the number of integers in the list 'lst'.**
