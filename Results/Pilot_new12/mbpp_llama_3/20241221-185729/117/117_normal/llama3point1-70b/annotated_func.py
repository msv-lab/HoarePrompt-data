#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the number of integers in the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list as input, counts the number of integer elements within the list, and returns this count. It handles lists containing any combination of data types, including integers, non-integer numbers, strings, and other types, treating them as non-integer for the purposes of the count. The function does not modify the input list and does not account for potential edge cases such as an empty list or a list containing nested structures, but it implicitly handles these cases by returning 0 for an empty list and counting integers within the top level of the list. The final state of the program after execution includes the return value, which is the total count of integers in the input list.
