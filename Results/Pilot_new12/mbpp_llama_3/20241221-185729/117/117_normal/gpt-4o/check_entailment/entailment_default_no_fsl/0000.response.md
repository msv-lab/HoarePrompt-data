Correctness: **True**

I believe the code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. It uses a generator expression with the `isinstance` function to check if each element in the list is an integer, and the `sum` function to count the total number of integers.

The function handles lists containing mixed data types, including integers and non-integer values, and accurately counts only the integers. It also correctly handles lists containing duplicate integers, counting each one towards the total count. The function does not modify the input list and supports lists of any size, including empty lists, in which case it returns 0.

The provided assertions and output hints demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios, including lists with mixed data types, lists with only integers, and lists with non-integer values. Since I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the code is correct. 

Note that, as per the problem description, we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, we do not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or an empty list, as these are not considered valid inputs.
