Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` correctly returns the number of integer elements in a given list. The function utilizes a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `lst`. It checks if each element is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance` function. If an element is an integer, it counts towards the sum (which is equivalent to incrementing a counter by 1), and if not, it is ignored.

The function handles lists with mixed data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.) correctly, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. For instance, the test `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2` verifies that the function correctly counts only the integer elements (1 and 2) in a list that contains non-integer elements ('abc' and 1.2).

Additionally, the function should work correctly for edge cases such as an empty list, a list containing only integers, a list containing only non-integer elements, a list with duplicate integers, and lists with negative integers or zero, as it simply counts elements based on their type, without considering their values.

Given that the code correctly implements the required functionality and handles various potential cases as expected, the program is considered correct according to the provided problem description.
