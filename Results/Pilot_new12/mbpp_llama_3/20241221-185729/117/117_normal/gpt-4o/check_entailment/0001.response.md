Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and checks if the element is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance` function. The `sum` function then adds up the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including lists with a mix of integers, floats, and strings, as well as lists with only integers.

Upon reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, I could not find any scenario where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles empty lists, lists with non-integer elements, and lists with duplicate integers. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
