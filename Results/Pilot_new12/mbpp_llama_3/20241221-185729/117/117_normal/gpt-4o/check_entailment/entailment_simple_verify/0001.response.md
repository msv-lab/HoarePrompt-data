Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct. 

The original assessment provides a thorough explanation of how the function `func_1` works, including its use of a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and check if the element is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance` function. The assessment also notes that the `sum` function adds up the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. It describes the state of the program right before the function call as `lst` being a list, which aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The annotation also notes that the program returns the number of integers in the list `lst`, which is consistent with the problem description and the original assessment.

I see no reason to disagree with the original assessment. The code is straightforward and accurately implements the described functionality. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases.

The assumption that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program is also reasonable in this context, as it allows us to focus on the core functionality of the program without considering edge cases that are not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Final: **True**
