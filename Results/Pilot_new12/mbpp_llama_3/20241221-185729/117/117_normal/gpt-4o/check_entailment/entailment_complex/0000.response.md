Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list and checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. If `x` is an integer, it counts towards the sum, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including lists with mixed data types and lists containing only integers. The function correctly handles these cases and returns the expected count of integers.

The function does not modify the input list, supports lists of any size (including empty lists), and correctly handles lists containing duplicate integers. The function's output is an integer value representing the total count of integers found in the input list, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
