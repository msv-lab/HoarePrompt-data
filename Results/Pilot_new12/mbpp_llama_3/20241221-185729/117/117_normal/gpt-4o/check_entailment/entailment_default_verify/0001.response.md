The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I agree with this assessment. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression to iterate over each element and checking if it's an instance of the `int` type. The `sum` function then adds up the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, effectively counting the number of integers.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling lists with mixed data types, empty lists, and lists with duplicate integers. The hints also state that the function does not modify the input list and supports lists of any size, which aligns with the code's behavior.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the function's purpose and its ability to handle various cases, including lists with a mix of integers, floats, and strings, as well as lists with only integers. The assessment also notes that the function correctly handles empty lists, lists with non-integer elements, and lists with duplicate integers.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
