Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list and count the integer elements. It correctly handles lists containing mixed data types, including integers and non-integer values, and accurately counts only the integers.

The function does not modify the input list and supports lists of any size, including empty lists, in which case it returns 0. It also correctly handles lists containing duplicate integers, counting each one towards the total count.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases, including lists with mixed data types, lists with only integers, and lists with a mix of integers and floating-point numbers.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function accurately counts the integers in the input list, without modifying the list or handling cases with invalid input (as we assume the input will always be valid).

Since the code correctly implements the specified functionality and handles all potential cases as described, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
