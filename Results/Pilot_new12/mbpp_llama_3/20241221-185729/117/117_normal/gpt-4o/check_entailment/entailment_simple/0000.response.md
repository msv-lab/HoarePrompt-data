Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. 

The provided function `func_1` accomplishes this task by using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`. If the element is an integer, it counts towards the sum (which effectively counts the number of integers in the list), and if not, it is ignored in the sum.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including a mix of integer and non-integer elements, a list consisting entirely of integers, and a list with both integers and floats. The function behaves as expected in all these scenarios, correctly counting and returning the number of integer elements in the list.

Since the problem description specifies that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list with elements that can be checked for being integers), and the function correctly handles such inputs to return the count of integers, the function is correct according to the given problem description.
