#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the number of integers in the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. It handles lists containing mixed data types, including integers and non-integer values, and accurately counts only the integers. The function does not modify the input list and supports lists of any size, including empty lists, in which case it returns 0. It also correctly handles lists containing duplicate integers, counting each one towards the total count. The function's output is an integer value representing the total count of integers found in the input list.
