Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `V = A * h`, where `A` is the area of the triangular base and `h` is the height (or length) of the prism.

In this case, the function correctly calculates the area of the triangular base (`base_area = 0.5 * base * height`) and then multiplies it by the length of the prism (`volume = base_area * length`) to find the volume.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's correctness for different inputs. The function handles various cases, including different base and height dimensions, and it always returns the correct volume.

There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. It assumes that the input values for base, height, and length are non-negative, which is a reasonable assumption for geometric calculations. If the inputs were negative, the function would still work, but the result would be incorrect because negative values for base, height, or length do not make sense in this context. However, this is a limitation of the problem description rather than the function itself.

Overall, the function is correctly implemented and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
