Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula used to calculate the volume is correct: it first calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, and then multiplies this area by the length of the prism to get the volume.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles different inputs and calculates the volume of the triangular prism according to the provided problem description. The unit tests provided also validate the function's correctness for different input cases.

The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops, and it simply applies the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, making it straightforward and easy to understand. Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided source code, I conclude that the program is correct.
