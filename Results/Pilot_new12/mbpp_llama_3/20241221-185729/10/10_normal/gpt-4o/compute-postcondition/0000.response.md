The given code calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: area = 0.5 * base * height. 

`base_area` is assigned the value of 0.5 * base * height. The values of `base` and `height` are positive numbers, and `length` is also a positive number. 

Since `base_area` equals 0.5 times `base` times `height`, it will be a positive value because both `base` and `height` are positive numbers.

Therefore, the Output State is: `base` is a positive number, `height` is a positive number, `length` is a positive number, `base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`.

Output State: **`base` is a positive number, `height` is a positive number, `length` is a positive number, `base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`**
