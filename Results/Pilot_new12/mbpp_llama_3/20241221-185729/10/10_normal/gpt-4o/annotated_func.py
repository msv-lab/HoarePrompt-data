#State of the program right berfore the function call: base, height, and length are positive numbers.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume, which is 0.5 times the product of the positive base, height, and length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a shape given its base, height, and length, where the volume is 0.5 times the product of the base, height, and length. It accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, which are expected to be positive numbers. The function does not perform any error checking to ensure these parameters are indeed positive, and it does not handle cases where the parameters might be zero, negative, or non-numeric. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns a single numeric value representing the calculated volume, which can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the input values, with no modification to the input parameters.
