You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this function, `b` represents the base of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism.

The function correctly implements this formula by returning `b * h / 2 * l`, which is the product of the base area `(b * h / 2)` and the length `l` of the prism. 

I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. It handles all potential cases, including different values for the base, height, and length of the prism, and correctly calculates the volume for each case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of a prism with a triangular base, where the base of the triangle is a positive number `b`, the height of the triangle is a positive number `h`, and the length of the prism is a positive number `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a prism with a triangular base, given the base length `b`, the height of the triangle `h`, and the length of the prism `l`. It accepts three parameters, all of which are expected to be positive numbers. The function does not include error checking or handling for non-positive or non-numeric inputs, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. After execution, the function's state concludes with the return of the calculated volume, without modifying the original input parameters `b`, `h`, or `l`. The calculated volume is the product of the area of the triangular base (`b * h / 2`) and the length of the prism (`l`).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
