Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this function, `b` represents the base of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism.

The function correctly implements this formula by returning `b * h / 2 * l`, which is the product of the base area `(b * h / 2)` and the length `l` of the prism. 

I couldn't find any case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. It handles all potential cases, including different values for the base, height, and length of the prism, and correctly calculates the volume for each case.
