Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is a triangle. The area of a triangle is `(base * height) / 2`. Therefore, the volume of a triangular prism can be calculated as `b * h / 2 * l`, where `b` is the base length of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. 

This formula is correctly implemented in the given function. The function takes three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l` and returns the product of `b`, `h` divided by 2, and `l`, which is the correct formula for the volume of a triangular prism.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. It correctly calculates the volume for all valid inputs (positive values of `b`, `h`, and `l`). Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
