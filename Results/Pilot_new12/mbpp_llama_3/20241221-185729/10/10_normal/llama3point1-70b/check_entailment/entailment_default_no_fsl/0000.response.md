Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a simple function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism given the base length, height of the triangle, and length of the prism. The formula used (`b * h / 2 * l`) correctly calculates the volume by first finding the area of the triangular base (`b * h / 2`) and then multiplying it by the length of the prism (`l`). 

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., three positive numbers), the function will always return the correct volume without any errors. The function does not need to handle invalid inputs (like non-positive or non-numeric inputs) because the problem statement and the assumption of valid input guarantee that such cases will not occur. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given code, the function is correct for every potential valid case.
