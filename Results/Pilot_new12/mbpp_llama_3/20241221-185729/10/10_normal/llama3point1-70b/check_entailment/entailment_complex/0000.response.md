Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is the area of the base (which is a triangle) times the height of the prism. The area of a triangle is given by `0.5 * base * height`, and in this context, the base of the triangle is represented by `b` and the height of the triangle by `h`. The function multiplies this area by the length of the prism, `l`, to find the volume.

Given that the inputs `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively, the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism as `b * h / 2 * l`. This matches the mathematical definition and thus the function does what the problem description asks for every potential valid input. 

Therefore, assuming valid inputs are always provided as per the problem's assumptions, the function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism for all positive input values of `b`, `h`, and `l`.
