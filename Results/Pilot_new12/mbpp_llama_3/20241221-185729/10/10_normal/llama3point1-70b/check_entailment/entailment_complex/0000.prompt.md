You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of a prism with a triangular base, where the base of the triangle is a positive number `b`, the height of the triangle is a positive number `h`, and the length of the prism is a positive number `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a prism with a triangular base, given the base length `b`, the height of the triangle `h`, and the length of the prism `l`. It accepts three parameters, all of which are expected to be positive numbers. The function does not include error checking or handling for non-positive or non-numeric inputs, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. After execution, the function's state concludes with the return of the calculated volume, without modifying the original input parameters `b`, `h`, or `l`. The calculated volume is the product of the area of the triangular base (`b * h / 2`) and the length of the prism (`l`).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
