Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1(b, h, l)`, calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly. The formula used to calculate the volume of a triangular prism is `0.5 * base * height * length`, where `base` is the base of the triangle, `height` is the height of the triangle, and `length` is the length of the prism.

In the given function, the variables `b`, `h`, and `l` represent the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively. The function returns the product of `b`, `h`, and `l` divided by 2, which is equivalent to `0.5 * b * h * l`. Therefore, the function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the provided problem description.

Since the problem description assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers), the function will always produce the correct result for every potential case that meets the problem description.
