#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of a prism with a triangular base, where the base of the triangle is a positive number `b`, the height of the triangle is a positive number `h`, and the length of the prism is a positive number `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a prism with a triangular base, given the base length `b`, the height of the triangle `h`, and the length of the prism `l`. It accepts three parameters, all of which are expected to be positive numbers. The function does not include error checking or handling for non-positive or non-numeric inputs, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. After execution, the function's state concludes with the return of the calculated volume, without modifying the original input parameters `b`, `h`, or `l`. The calculated volume is the product of the area of the triangular base (`b * h / 2`) and the length of the prism (`l`).
