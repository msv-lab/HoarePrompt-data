#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, which is a non-negative number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the product of two input parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative numbers. The result is a non-negative number, which is the product of the two inputs. The function handles cases where either or both inputs are zero, returning zero in such instances. It also handles positive numbers correctly, returning their product. However, it does not validate if the inputs are non-negative, so if negative numbers are provided, the function will still return a result, which could be negative, thus not adhering to the stated postcondition of always returning a non-negative number. The function does not modify the input parameters, and its primary action is the calculation and return of the product.
