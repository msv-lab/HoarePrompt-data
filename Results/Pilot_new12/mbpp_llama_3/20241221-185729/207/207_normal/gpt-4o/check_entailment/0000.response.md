Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the formula for the area of a rectangle.

The unit tests provided, `assert func_1(10, 20) == 200`, `assert func_1(10, 5) == 50`, and `assert func_1(4, 2) == 8`, all pass and demonstrate the function's correctness for different input values.

Furthermore, the function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Positive integer values for length and width
- Zero values for length or width, which would result in an area of zero
- Negative values for length or width, which would result in a negative area (although this may not be physically meaningful, it is mathematically correct)

The function does not handle non-numeric input values, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. If the problem description were to include requirements for handling such cases, the function might need to be modified to handle them correctly. However, based on the provided problem description and code, the function is correct.
