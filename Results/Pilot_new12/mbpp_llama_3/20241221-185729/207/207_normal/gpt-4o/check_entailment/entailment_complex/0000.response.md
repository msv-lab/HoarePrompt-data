Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated as the product of its length and width. The provided function, `func_1`, takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle.

The function handles cases where either or both inputs are zero, returning zero in such instances, and also handles positive numbers correctly, returning their product. The function does not modify the input parameters, and its primary action is the calculation and return of the product, which is the expected result for calculating the area of a rectangle.

Given that we assume the input will be valid (i.e., non-negative numbers), the function will always return the correct area of the rectangle. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate that the function behaves as expected for different input values.

Therefore, since the function correctly calculates the area of a rectangle based on the provided length and width, and given the assumption of valid input, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
