Correctness: **False**

The program does not strictly follow the problem description for every potential case. It calculates and returns the product of two input parameters, `length` and `width`, but it does not validate if the inputs are non-negative numbers. If negative numbers are provided, the function will still return a result, which could be negative, thus not adhering to the postcondition of always returning a non-negative number, as expected from the area of a rectangle. The hint about the function not validating if the inputs are non-negative and still returning a result for negative inputs supports this. For instance, `func_1(-10, 20)` would return `-200`, which is not a valid area for a rectangle. This indicates the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem, specifically the case of negative inputs.
