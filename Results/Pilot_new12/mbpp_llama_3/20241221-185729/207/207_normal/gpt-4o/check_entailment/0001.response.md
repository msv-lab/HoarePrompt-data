Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a function named `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. This is indeed the correct formula for calculating the area of a rectangle. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases, but since the problem description does not specify any particular requirements for handling such cases, the function can be considered correct.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs. The function works as expected for positive integer inputs, and since the formula for the area of a rectangle is a simple multiplication, it is likely to work correctly for all numeric inputs.

One potential consideration is that the function does not check the validity of its inputs. If the inputs are not numbers, the function will raise an exception. However, since the problem description does not specify how to handle non-numeric inputs, it can be assumed that the function is intended to be used only with numeric inputs.

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is True.
