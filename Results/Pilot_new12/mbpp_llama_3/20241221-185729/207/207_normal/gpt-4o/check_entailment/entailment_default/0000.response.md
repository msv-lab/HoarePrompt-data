Correctness: **False**.

The code does not validate if the inputs are non-negative, so if negative numbers are provided, the function will still return a result, which could be negative, thus not adhering to the stated postcondition of always returning a non-negative number. For example, `func_1(-10, 20)` will return `-200`, which is not the area of a rectangle. The function should either validate the inputs or document that it can handle negative numbers, but currently, it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
