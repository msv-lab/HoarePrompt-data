The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. 

To verify the correctness of this function based on the problem description, let's analyze how it behaves for potential cases:

1. **Definition of Area**: The area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width. The function `func_1` correctly implements this mathematical definition by multiplying the `length` and `width` parameters and returning the result.

2. **Handling Non-Negative Inputs**: The problem description does not explicitly state that inputs must be non-negative, but it implies that we are dealing with valid geometric shapes, where dimensions are non-negative. The provided assertions and the return statement of the function also align with this assumption. The function correctly calculates the area for non-negative inputs as demonstrated by the assertions provided.

3. **Input Validation**: The problem states an assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the function does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs (like negative numbers or non-numeric values), as it is presumed that such inputs will not be provided.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description**: The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description for all expected cases. It calculates the area of a rectangle as the product of its length and width, which is exactly what the problem asks for.

Given these points, the function `func_1` accurately implements the calculation of a rectangle's area as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed for all potential cases under the assumption of valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
