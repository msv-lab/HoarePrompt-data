#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the product of two input parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative numbers. It does not modify the input parameters. The function handles all possible combinations of non-negative numeric inputs, including zero and positive numbers, and returns their product. It does not include any error checking or handling for negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, which may result in incorrect results or errors if such inputs are provided. The function's return value is the result of the multiplication operation, which can be zero if either of the inputs is zero, or a positive number if both inputs are positive.
