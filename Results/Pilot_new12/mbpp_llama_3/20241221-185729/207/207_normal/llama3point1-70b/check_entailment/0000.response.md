Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1(length, width)`, correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for all non-negative values of length and width. The formula used, `length * width`, is the standard mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle. This function will work correctly for all valid inputs (i.e., non-negative numbers), including zero and positive numbers.

It is worth noting that this function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values. However, based on the provided problem description, the function is correct in that it performs the intended operation for all valid cases. 

To further improve this function, you might consider adding error handling to deal with potential invalid inputs, but as it stands, it correctly calculates the area of a rectangle as per the problem description.
