Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. This function handles every potential case as long as the inputs are numbers, because the formula for the area of a rectangle is indeed length times width.

For example, if you call `func_1(4, 5)`, the function returns `20`, which is the correct area of a rectangle with a length of 4 and a width of 5. This function will work correctly for any positive or negative numbers (though in geometry, negative lengths and widths are not typical), and for zero (where the area would be zero).

However, it's worth noting that this function does not include any error checking. If non-numeric inputs are provided, the function will throw an error. Nevertheless, based on the given problem description, which only asks for a function to calculate the area of a rectangle without specifying any constraints on the inputs or error handling, the provided function meets the requirements for the task as described. 

Therefore, assuming the function should work with numeric inputs, it is correct.
