You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the product of two input parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative numbers. It does not modify the input parameters. The function handles all possible combinations of non-negative numeric inputs, including zero and positive numbers, and returns their product. It does not include any error checking or handling for negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, which may result in incorrect results or errors if such inputs are provided. The function's return value is the result of the multiplication operation, which can be zero if either of the inputs is zero, or a positive number if both inputs are positive.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
