Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is typically calculated as the product of its length and width. The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the correct formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program (i.e., `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers), the function will always return the correct area of the rectangle. The function does not need to handle invalid inputs or edge cases, as this is not specified in the problem description. Therefore, for every potential valid case, the program will correctly calculate the area of the rectangle, making it a correct implementation according to the problem description.
