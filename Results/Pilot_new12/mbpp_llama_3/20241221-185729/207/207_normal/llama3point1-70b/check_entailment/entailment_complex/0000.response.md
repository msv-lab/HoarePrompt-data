Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated as the product of its length and width. The provided Python function `func_1` takes two non-negative numbers `length` and `width` as input and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. 

The function handles all possible combinations of non-negative numeric inputs, including zero and positive numbers, and returns their product. The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program ensures that the function works as expected. 

In every potential case, the function calculates and returns the correct area of the rectangle, given valid non-negative numeric inputs for length and width. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
