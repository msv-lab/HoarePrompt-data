You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1(length, width)`, correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for all non-negative values of length and width. The formula used, `length * width`, is the standard mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle. This function will work correctly for all valid inputs (i.e., non-negative numbers), including zero and positive numbers.

It is worth noting that this function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values. However, based on the provided problem description, the function is correct in that it performs the intended operation for all valid cases. 

To further improve this function, you might consider adding error handling to deal with potential invalid inputs, but as it stands, it correctly calculates the area of a rectangle as per the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the product of two input parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative numbers. It does not modify the input parameters. The function handles all possible combinations of non-negative numeric inputs, including zero and positive numbers, and returns their product. It does not include any error checking or handling for negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, which may result in incorrect results or errors if such inputs are provided. The function's return value is the result of the multiplication operation, which can be zero if either of the inputs is zero, or a positive number if both inputs are positive.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
