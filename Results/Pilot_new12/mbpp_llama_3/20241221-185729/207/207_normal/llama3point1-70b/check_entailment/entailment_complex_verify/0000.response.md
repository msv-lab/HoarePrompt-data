The original assessment states that the function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for all non-negative values of length and width. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The formula used, `length * width`, is the standard mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by stating that the function returns the product of two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative numbers. The annotations also confirm that the function handles all possible combinations of non-negative numeric inputs, including zero and positive numbers, and returns their product.

Given the assumption that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function is correct as it stands. It correctly calculates the area of a rectangle for all valid inputs, and the annotations provide further evidence of this correctness.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program's correctness is maintained.

Final: **True**
