Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The function recursively traverses the input list, appending non-list elements (which are integers in this case) to the `flat_list` and recursively flattening any inner lists.

The function handles recursive nesting of lists, and the returned `flat_list` contains all the primitive elements (integers) that were present in the input `nested_list`, in the order they were encountered during the flattening process.

The examples provided in the problem description demonstrate the function's correctness for various nested list scenarios. The function also effectively removes any nesting, resulting in a fully flattened list as required.

The output hints further support the code's correctness, describing the function's behavior in handling nested lists, non-integer elements, and the order of elements in the resulting `flat_list`.

It is worth noting that the function assumes the input will be a valid nested list structure and does not include error checking for cases where the input may not be a list or may contain non-integer, non-list elements. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will always be valid, so this does not affect the correctness of the function.
