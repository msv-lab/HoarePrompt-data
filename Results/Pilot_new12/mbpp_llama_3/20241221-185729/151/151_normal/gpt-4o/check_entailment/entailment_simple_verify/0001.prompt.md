You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, appears to correctly flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the input list. If the item is itself a list, the function calls itself with that item, effectively flattening any sublists. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the result list (`flat_list`).

This recursive approach ensures that the function can handle nested lists of arbitrary depth and complexity. The `isinstance(item, list)` check is crucial for determining whether to recurse or simply append an item to the `flat_list`.

To verify the correctness of this function, one would ideally need to find a case where it fails to flatten a nested list as expected. However, based on the provided assertions and a general understanding of how the function is designed, it seems to handle various scenarios correctly:

1. **Single-Level Nested Lists**: Lists with a mixture of integers and single-level nested lists are handled correctly, as demonstrated by the assertions.
2. **Multi-Level Nested Lists**: Although not directly tested in the provided assertions, the recursive nature of the function suggests it would correctly handle lists nested to any depth.
3. **Empty Lists or Single-Element Lists**: While not explicitly tested in the assertions, the function should handle empty lists or lists containing a single element (whether that element is an integer or another list) without issues. For example, `func_1([])` should return `[]`, and `func_1([10])` should return `[10]`.
4. **Lists Containing Other Types of Elements**: The function only checks if an item is a list and appends it to `flat_list` if it's not. This means it would treat elements of any other type (e.g., strings, floats, dictionaries) as non-list items and append them as is to `flat_list`.

Given the recursive approach and the use of `isinstance` to check for nested lists, along with the absence of any evident edge cases that the function does not handle, it appears that `func_1` is correctly implemented to flatten nested lists as per the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, which can also be nested.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other nested lists, `flat_list` contains the fully flattened elements of `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains the fully flattened elements of nested_list, where nested_list is a list that can contain integers and/or other nested lists


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
