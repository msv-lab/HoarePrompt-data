Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accepts a nested list structure and returns a new list containing all the elements of the input list in a fully flattened state.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

- The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input, which can contain integers and/or other nested lists.
- It iterates over each item in the `nested_list`. If an item is a list, it calls itself recursively with that item as the new `nested_list`, effectively flattening it. The `extend` method is used to add all elements from the flattened sublist to the `flat_list`.
- If an item is not a list, it simply appends it to the `flat_list`.
- After processing all items in the `nested_list`, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the original list in a fully flattened state.
- The function handles recursive nesting of lists and includes non-integer, non-list elements in the `flat_list` without modification.
- The original `nested_list` remains unchanged, as required.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list that may contain integers and/or other lists), the function's lack of error checking for invalid inputs (e.g., non-list inputs) does not affect its correctness in this context.
