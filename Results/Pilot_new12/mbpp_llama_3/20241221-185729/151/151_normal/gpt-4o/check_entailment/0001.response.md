Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, appears to correctly flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each item in the input list. If the item is itself a list, the function calls itself with that item, effectively flattening any sublists. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the result list (`flat_list`).

This recursive approach ensures that the function can handle nested lists of arbitrary depth and complexity. The `isinstance(item, list)` check is crucial for determining whether to recurse or simply append an item to the `flat_list`.

To verify the correctness of this function, one would ideally need to find a case where it fails to flatten a nested list as expected. However, based on the provided assertions and a general understanding of how the function is designed, it seems to handle various scenarios correctly:

1. **Single-Level Nested Lists**: Lists with a mixture of integers and single-level nested lists are handled correctly, as demonstrated by the assertions.
2. **Multi-Level Nested Lists**: Although not directly tested in the provided assertions, the recursive nature of the function suggests it would correctly handle lists nested to any depth.
3. **Empty Lists or Single-Element Lists**: While not explicitly tested in the assertions, the function should handle empty lists or lists containing a single element (whether that element is an integer or another list) without issues. For example, `func_1([])` should return `[]`, and `func_1([10])` should return `[10]`.
4. **Lists Containing Other Types of Elements**: The function only checks if an item is a list and appends it to `flat_list` if it's not. This means it would treat elements of any other type (e.g., strings, floats, dictionaries) as non-list items and append them as is to `flat_list`.

Given the recursive approach and the use of `isinstance` to check for nested lists, along with the absence of any evident edge cases that the function does not handle, it appears that `func_1` is correctly implemented to flatten nested lists as per the problem description.
