Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function recursively checks each element of the input list (`nested_list`) to determine whether it is a list or not. If the element is a list, the function calls itself with the nested list as the new input list, effectively flattening the nested list structure. If the element is not a list, it is simply appended to the `flat_list`.

The function handles recursive nesting of lists, ensuring that all inner lists are fully flattened, regardless of their depth. The returned `flat_list` contains only integers and other non-list elements in the order they were encountered during the flattening process.

The output hints agree with the code and highlight that the function handles recursive nesting, includes all primitive elements in the output, and maintains the original order of elements. The hints also mention that the function does not handle cases where `nested_list` is `None` or not a list, but this does not affect the correctness of the function since we assume that the input will be valid.

Furthermore, the provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios, including nested lists of varying depths and lists containing only integers. Since we assume that the input will be valid, we do not need to consider error handling for cases like `None` or non-list inputs.

Overall, the function correctly implements the problem description, and its output matches the expected results for all potential cases.
