Correctness: **True**

The given program is a recursive implementation of a function to flatten a nested list structure. It correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

Here's why it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input and initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
2. It iterates over each item in the `nested_list`.
3. If the item is a list (checked using `isinstance(item, list)`), it recursively calls `func_1` on that item and extends the `flat_list` with the result. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened.
4. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the `flat_list`.
5. After processing all items, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains the fully flattened elements of the original `nested_list`.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: The function will simply return an empty list.
* Lists with only integers: The function will return a list with the same integers.
* Lists with nested lists: The function will recursively flatten the nested lists and return a single list with all integers.
* Lists with multiple levels of nesting: The function will recursively flatten the nested lists to any depth and return a single list with all integers.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases.

In summary, the program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure, meeting all the requirements of the problem description.
