You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It iterates over each item in the input list. If an item is itself a list, the function calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it and adding all its elements to the result list. If an item is not a list, it simply appends this item to the result list.

This approach ensures that the function can handle nested lists of any depth, as it recursively flattens each sublist it encounters. The use of `extend` when adding elements from a sublist to the flat list is particularly important, as it avoids nesting lists further by adding each element individually.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's ability to correctly flatten various nested list structures, including those with multiple levels of nesting. Without being able to find a specific case where the function does not work as expected, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

The key factors supporting the correctness of the function include:
- Its ability to handle recursive nesting of lists.
- Proper iteration and appending of non-list items.
- The use of `isinstance` to identify list items and handle them accordingly.
- The function's behavior as demonstrated by the provided unit tests, which cover a variety of input scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list (`nested_list`) that can contain integers and/or other nested lists, and returns a new list (`flat_list`) containing all the elements of `nested_list` in a fully flattened state, effectively removing any nesting. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged. The function handles recursive nesting of lists, and the returned `flat_list` contains only integers, with all inner lists having been fully flattened. The function does not handle cases where `nested_list` is `None` or not a list, and does not perform any error checking on its input. If `nested_list` contains non-integer and non-list elements, these elements will be included in the `flat_list` without modification. The function's output is a flat list of all the primitive elements (integers and other non-list elements) that were present in the input `nested_list`, in the order they were encountered during the flattening process.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
