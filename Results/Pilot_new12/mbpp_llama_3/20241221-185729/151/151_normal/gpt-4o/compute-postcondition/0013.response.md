To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, is iterable, and has at least one more item after the current item.
- `flat_list` contains the previously flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`, and now also includes the next item from `nested_list` as processed by `func_1` if the next item is a list, otherwise the next item itself.

The code is: 
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```

This means that the `flat_list` will now include one additional element which is `item`. 

Since the `item` is described as the next item from `nested_list` as processed by `func_1` if it is a list, otherwise the next item itself, and given that we do not have the specifics of `func_1`, we can say that `flat_list` now contains all its previous elements plus `item`, which could either be a processed list (through `func_1`) or an integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one less item than previously (since one item has been processed and added to `flat_list`); `flat_list` contains all its previous elements (previously flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`), plus `item`, which is either the next item from `nested_list` processed by `func_1` if it was a list or the next item itself if it was not a list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one less item than previously; `flat_list` contains all its previous elements plus `item`, which is either the next item from `nested_list` processed by `func_1` if it was a list or the next item itself if it was not a list**
