According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least one more item, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least one more item. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more item after the current item. 

Considering the `flat_list`, since the loop body is omitted but we know that `flat_list` is updated based on the processing of items in `nested_list` by `func_1` if an item is a list, or by directly adding the item if it's an integer, we can infer that at the start of the next iteration, `flat_list` would include the elements or the results of the processing of the next item in `nested_list`, in addition to what it already contains.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one more item after the current item; `flat_list` contains the previously flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`, and now also includes the next item from `nested_list` as processed by `func_1` if the next item is a list, otherwise the next item itself**
