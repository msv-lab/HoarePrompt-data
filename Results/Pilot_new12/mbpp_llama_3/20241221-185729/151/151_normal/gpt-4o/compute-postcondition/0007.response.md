According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least one more item, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must be iterable, `flat_list` contains the flattened elements of any lists within `nested_list` or individual integer elements from `nested_list`. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time `nested_list` must have at least one more item, and `flat_list` will contain the elements of the previous items in `nested_list` that have been processed. 
State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one more item, `flat_list` contains the flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`**
