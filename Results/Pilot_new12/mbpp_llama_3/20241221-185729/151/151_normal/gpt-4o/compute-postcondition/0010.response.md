Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one more item; if an item in `nested_list` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the original elements plus the flattened elements of any lists within the processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the processed items of `nested_list` as processed by `func_1`, otherwise `flat_list` contains the previously flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`, and now also includes the current `item`.**
