To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`. If an item is a list, it calls `func_1` on that item, which presumably flattens the list (though the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, based on the context, we can infer its purpose is to flatten the list). The flattened elements are then added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. If an item is not a list (i.e., it's an integer or any other type of object), it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `nested_list` remains unchanged throughout the process, as the loop only reads from it and does not modify it.
2. `flat_list` accumulates elements from `nested_list`, where lists are recursively flattened (via the `func_1` function) and their elements added to `flat_list`, and non-list items are directly appended.

Considering these patterns and the loop's behavior, after all iterations have finished:

- `nested_list` will still be the original list that could contain integers and/or other lists, which can also be nested. Its state does not change during the execution of the loop.
- `flat_list` will contain all elements from `nested_list`, with any nested lists fully flattened. This means if `nested_list` originally contained integers or lists (including nested lists), `flat_list` will contain all the integers from these lists, without any nesting.

If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `flat_list` will remain an empty list.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other nested lists, `flat_list` contains the fully flattened elements of `nested_list`.**
