To determine the output state, we first need to understand what `func_1(item)` does, but since its definition is not provided, we'll assume it's a function designed to flatten a list (given the context that `item` is a list and the goal seems to be to flatten nested lists into `flat_list`). 

Given that `item` represents an element in `nested_list` and its current value is a list, `func_1(item)` would presumably return a flattened version of `item`. If `item` itself contains integers and/or other lists, `func_1(item)` would recursively or iteratively flatten it, returning a list of integers.

The `extend` method of `flat_list` is then used to add all elements returned by `func_1(item)` to `flat_list`.

Therefore, the impact on the program state is as follows:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged since we're not modifying it directly.
- `flat_list`, initially empty, now contains the flattened elements of `item`, which was a list within `nested_list`.
- `item` still represents an element in `nested_list`, but its value has been processed by `func_1` and its contents added to `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` contains the flattened elements of `item` (a list within `nested_list`), `item` represents a list within `nested_list` that has been processed and added to `flat_list`.**
