The `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the next item from `nested_list`. If the next item is a list, `func_1` processes it, otherwise, the next item itself is used.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one more item after the current item; `flat_list` contains the previously flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`, and now also includes the next item from `nested_list` as processed by `func_1` if the next item is a list, otherwise the next item itself, where the next item has been processed and appended to `flat_list`**
