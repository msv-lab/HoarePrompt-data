To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable, and has at least one more item.
- `flat_list` contains the flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`.

The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` implies that for each `item` in `nested_list`, a function `func_1` is applied to it, and the results are extended to `flat_list`.

Since the specifics of `func_1` are not provided, we must assume that `func_1` is designed to flatten the input `item` if it's a list (possibly recursively if the list can contain lists) or return the `item` itself if it's not a list. This assumption is based on the typical purpose of flattening nested lists.

Therefore, the impact of the code on the program is:
- The `flat_list` will contain more elements, specifically the flattened versions of the items in `nested_list` that were processed by `func_1`.
- The nature of `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet provided.
- The `flat_list` now contains all the elements it had before plus the additional elements resulting from applying `func_1` to each `item` in `nested_list`.

Given the lack of specificity about `func_1`, the exact contents of `flat_list` after the operation depend on the implementation of `func_1`. However, in general, `flat_list` will now include the flattened elements of `nested_list` as processed by `func_1`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one more item; `flat_list` contains the original elements plus the flattened elements of any lists within the processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the processed items of `nested_list` as processed by `func_1`.**
