Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, must be iterable and has at least one more item after the current item if the next item was a list that got processed, otherwise it has at least one less item than previously; `flat_list` contains the previously flattened elements of any lists within the previously processed items of `nested_list` or individual integer elements from the previously processed items of `nested_list`, and now also includes the next item from `nested_list` as processed by `func_1` if the next item is a list, otherwise the next item itself, which has been processed and appended to `flat_list` if it was a list, or just appended if it was not a list.**
