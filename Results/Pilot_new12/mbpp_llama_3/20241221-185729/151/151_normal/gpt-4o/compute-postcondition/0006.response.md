Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must be iterable, `flat_list` contains the flattened elements of any lists within `nested_list` or individual integer elements from `nested_list`, where if an `item` is a list, it has been recursively processed and its elements added to `flat_list`, and if an `item` is an integer, it has been directly added to `flat_list`.**
