To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the initial state.

The loop statement is:
```python
for item in nested_list:
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, which can also be nested.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `nested_list` must exist and be iterable.
2. Since the loop iterates over each item in `nested_list`, the state of `nested_list` should be that it has at least one item to iterate over. However, the loop can still technically execute if `nested_list` is empty; it will simply not perform any iterations.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `nested_list` must have at least one item or be empty, as both scenarios allow the loop to execute (though it does nothing if empty).
- `item` becomes a relevant state variable within the loop, representing each element in `nested_list` during iteration.
- `flat_list` remains an empty list at the start of the loop, but its state might change depending on the loop body, which is not provided.

Therefore, considering only the information provided and the loop statement itself:
State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must be iterable, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` represents an element in `nested_list`**
