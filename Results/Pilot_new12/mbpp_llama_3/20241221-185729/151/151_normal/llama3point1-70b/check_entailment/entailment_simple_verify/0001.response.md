Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure, and it does so correctly by recursively handling nested lists of arbitrary depth.

The annotated version of the code confirms the states of the program at different points, which matches the explanation provided in the original assessment. The function correctly initializes an empty list `flat_list`, iterates over the `nested_list`, handles nested lists by recursively calling `func_1`, and appends non-list elements to `flat_list`.

The annotations also describe the state of the program after the `for` loop has been executed, which indicates that `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` plus the results of applying `func_1` to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`. This is consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

Given that the annotated version of the code matches the explanation provided in the original assessment, and considering the problem description, it appears that the function is correct. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.

Final: **True**
