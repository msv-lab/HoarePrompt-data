You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth. Here's a breakdown of why it works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with an empty list `flat_list`. This list is used to accumulate all the elements from the nested list, regardless of their original nesting level.

2. **Iterating Over the Nested List**: The function iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`. For each element, it checks if `i` is itself a list.

3. **Handling Nested Lists**: If `i` is a list, the function calls itself with `i` as the new `nested_list` to flatten. The results (i.e., the flattened version of `i`) are then added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. This process continues recursively until all nested lists are flattened.

4. **Handling Non-List Elements**: If `i` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

5. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when there are no more lists within the list being processed. At this point, all elements from the original nested list have been flattened and placed into `flat_list`.

6. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which now contains all elements from the original nested list, but in a flattened structure.

Given this analysis, the function should correctly flatten any nested list structure. It handles both the base case (elements that are not lists) and the recursive case (elements that are lists), ensuring that all elements are properly flattened and added to the final list.

To demonstrate its correctness, consider the following examples:
- `func_1([1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- `func_1([[[1, 2], 3], 4, [5, [6, 7]]])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Without finding a specific case where the function fails to meet the problem description, it's reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, and returns a `flat_list` containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. The function recursively flattens the input list, handling nested lists of arbitrary depth. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function preserves the original order of elements and does not modify the input list. It handles edge cases such as an input list containing only integers, only lists, or a mix of both, and returns a flat list with all non-list elements. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, and assumes that the input is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
