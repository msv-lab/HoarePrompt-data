Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it properly implements a recursive function to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input and initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.

2. It then iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`. If `i` is a list itself, the function calls itself recursively with `i` as the new input list and appends the result to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. This ensures that all nested lists are properly flattened.

3. If `i` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer or other non-list element), it simply appends `i` to `flat_list`.

4. After processing all elements in the `nested_list`, the function returns `flat_list`, which now contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` plus the results of applying `func_1` to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`.

This recursive approach effectively flattens the nested list structure, meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

For example, if you call `func_1([1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]])`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the expected flattened list.

The program handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and correctly flattens them, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
