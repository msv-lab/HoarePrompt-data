The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure, and it achieves this through a recursive approach. The output hints further support the correctness of the program, highlighting its ability to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth, preserve the original order of elements, and handle various edge cases.

Given the provided code, the output hints, and the problem description, it's clear that the function is implemented correctly to flatten a nested list structure. The function's ability to recursively handle nested lists, preserve the order of elements, and handle edge cases (as detailed in the output hints) aligns with the problem description's requirements.

The key points that justify maintaining the original assessment include:
- The function correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten nested lists.
- It handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, as demonstrated by its recursive nature.
- The function preserves the original order of elements, which is a crucial requirement for such a list processing function.
- It correctly handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists with only integers, lists with only other lists, and lists with a mix of both.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the program's correctness can be confirmed. 

Final: **True**
