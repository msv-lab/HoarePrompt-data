Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth. Here's a breakdown of why it works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts with an empty list `flat_list`. This list is used to accumulate all the elements from the nested list, regardless of their original nesting level.

2. **Iterating Over the Nested List**: The function iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`. For each element, it checks if `i` is itself a list.

3. **Handling Nested Lists**: If `i` is a list, the function calls itself with `i` as the new `nested_list` to flatten. The results (i.e., the flattened version of `i`) are then added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. This process continues recursively until all nested lists are flattened.

4. **Handling Non-List Elements**: If `i` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

5. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when there are no more lists within the list being processed. At this point, all elements from the original nested list have been flattened and placed into `flat_list`.

6. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which now contains all elements from the original nested list, but in a flattened structure.

Given this analysis, the function should correctly flatten any nested list structure. It handles both the base case (elements that are not lists) and the recursive case (elements that are lists), ensuring that all elements are properly flattened and added to the final list.

To demonstrate its correctness, consider the following examples:
- `func_1([1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- `func_1([[[1, 2], 3], 4, [5, [6, 7]]])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Without finding a specific case where the function fails to meet the problem description, it's reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs.
