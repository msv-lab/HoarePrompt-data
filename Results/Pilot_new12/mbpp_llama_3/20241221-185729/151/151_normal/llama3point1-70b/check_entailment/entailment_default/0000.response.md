Correctness: **True**

The code provided for the function `func_1(nested_list)` seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. It recursively flattens a given nested list structure into a single-level list. Here's why it's correct for every potential case:

1. **Handling Nested Lists**: The function correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth. If an element `i` in the `nested_list` is itself a list, the function calls itself with `i` as the new `nested_list` to flatten, and then extends the `flat_list` with the result. This recursive approach ensures that all nested lists are properly flattened.

2. **Handling Non-List Elements**: For elements in the `nested_list` that are not lists (i.e., integers or other types of objects), the function simply appends them to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all non-list elements are included in the final flattened list.

3. **Preserving Order**: The function preserves the original order of elements from the `nested_list`. This is because the `extend` method adds elements to the end of the list in the order they appear in the iterable (in this case, the result of the recursive call to `func_1(i)`), and the `append` method adds a single element to the end of the list.

4. **Handling Empty Lists**: If the input `nested_list` is empty, the function will return an empty list, as there are no elements to process. This behavior aligns with the problem description.

5. **No Error Handling for Non-List Inputs**: The problem statement and the output hints indicate that the function assumes the input will always be a list that may contain integers and/or other lists. Therefore, not handling cases where the input is not a list does not make the program incorrect, given the assumptions provided.

Given these points, the code seems to correctly implement the functionality described for flattening a nested list structure, assuming valid input as per the problem description.
