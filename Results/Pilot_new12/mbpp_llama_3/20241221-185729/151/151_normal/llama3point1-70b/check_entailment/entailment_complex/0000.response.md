Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1.  The function `func_1` accepts a `nested_list` as input, which may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements.
2.  It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
3.  The function iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on `i` and extends the `flat_list` with the returned flattened list. If `i` is not a list, it simply appends `i` to the `flat_list`.
4.  After processing all elements in the `nested_list`, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` in the original order.
5.  The function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, and it preserves the original order of elements.
6.  It correctly handles edge cases, such as an input list containing only integers, only lists, or a mix of both, and returns a flat list with all non-list elements.
7.  Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's lack of error checking or handling for non-list inputs does not affect its correctness.

Overall, the program meets the problem description's requirements and correctly flattens a given nested list structure.
