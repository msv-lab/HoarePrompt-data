You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It iterates over each element in the input list. If an element is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it and extending the `flat_list` with the result. If an element is not a list, it simply appends this element to the `flat_list`.

The key aspects that make this program correct for its intended purpose include:

1. **Recursive Handling of Nested Lists**: The function can handle nested lists of arbitrary depth because it recursively calls itself for each sublist encountered. This ensures that all nested structures are properly flattened.

2. **Handling of Non-List Elements**: The program correctly handles elements that are not lists by appending them directly to the `flat_list`. This behavior is in line with the requirement to flatten the list, which includes processing individual elements.

3. **Robustness to Input Variations**: The function is robust and can handle various input scenarios, including:
   - Empty lists
   - Lists containing only integers or other non-list elements
   - Lists with nested lists of varying depths
   - Lists with a mix of list and non-list elements

Given the logic of the program and its ability to handle a wide range of input scenarios, it appears to be correctly implemented for its intended purpose of flattening nested lists. There are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail to meet the problem description's requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, and returns a `flat_list` containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. The function recursively flattens the input list, handling nested lists of arbitrary depth. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function preserves the original order of elements and does not modify the input list. It handles edge cases such as an input list containing only integers, only lists, or a mix of both, and returns a flat list with all non-list elements. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, and assumes that the input is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
