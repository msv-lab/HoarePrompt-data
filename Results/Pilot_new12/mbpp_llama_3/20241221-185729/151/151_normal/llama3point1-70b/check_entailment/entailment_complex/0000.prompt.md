You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may be empty, `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` plus the results of applying `func_1` to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`, and `i` is the last element of the original `nested_list` if it is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list` which contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` plus the results of applying `func_1` to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, and returns a `flat_list` containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. The function recursively flattens the input list, handling nested lists of arbitrary depth. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function preserves the original order of elements and does not modify the input list. It handles edge cases such as an input list containing only integers, only lists, or a mix of both, and returns a flat list with all non-list elements. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs, and assumes that the input is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
