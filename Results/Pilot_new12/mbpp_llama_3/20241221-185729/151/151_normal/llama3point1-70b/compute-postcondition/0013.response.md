The code appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, the value appended to `flat_list` is the third element of `nested_list`. 

The states of `nested_list` and `i` are not affected. However, `flat_list` is updated by appending the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the third element of `nested_list` as its last element.**
