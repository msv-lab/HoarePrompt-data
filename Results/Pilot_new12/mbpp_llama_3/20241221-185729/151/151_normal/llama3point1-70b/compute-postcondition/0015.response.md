To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop's code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of applying `func_1` to `i`. If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` to `flat_list`.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer the following patterns:
- `nested_list` must have at least as many elements as the number of times the loop has executed.
- `i` takes the value of the current element being processed in `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`. The exact outcome depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. However, based on the loop's logic, we can deduce that `func_1` is expected to return a list or an iterable that can be extended into `flat_list`.
- If `i` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

Given these patterns and focusing on the loop's code, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `nested_list` would have been fully traversed, with each element processed according to its type (list or non-list).
- `i` would hold the value of the last element processed in `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` would contain all non-list elements from `nested_list` and the results of applying `func_1` to any list elements found in `nested_list`.

Considering the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `nested_list` is empty), `flat_list` would remain an empty list, as there would be no elements to process.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may be empty, `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` plus the results of applying `func_1` to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`, and `i` is the last element of the original `nested_list` if it is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined.**
