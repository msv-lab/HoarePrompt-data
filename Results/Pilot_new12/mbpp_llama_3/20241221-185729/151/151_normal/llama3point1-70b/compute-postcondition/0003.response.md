To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the given code snippet does. The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` extends the `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is a list itself.

Given that `i` is a list and is the first element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is initially an empty list, after the execution of the given code:

1. `nested_list` still has at least one element, with its first element being `i`, a list.
2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is a list and is used as an argument for `func_1`.
3. `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. However, without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we can only say that `flat_list` now contains elements that are the result of applying `func_1` to `i`. Since `i` is a list, `func_1(i)` presumably flattens or processes `i` in some way, but the exact nature of this processing is not specified.

Therefore, without knowing the definition of `func_1`, we can only describe the output state in general terms. 

However, assuming `func_1` is designed to process a list (given that `i` is a list), and without its specific implementation details, we can infer that `flat_list` will contain the result of this processing.

So, the output state after executing the given code snippet is:
- `nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, the first element of `nested_list` is `i`, 
- `i` is a list and remains unchanged,
- `flat_list` is a list extended with the result of `func_1(i)`, which means it now contains the processed elements of `i` as determined by `func_1`.

Given the lack of specifics about `func_1`, we cannot provide a more detailed description of `flat_list`'s contents.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least one element where the first element is `i`, a list; `i` remains a list; `flat_list` is extended with the result of applying `func_1` to `i`.**
