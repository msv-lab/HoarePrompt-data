Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `i` remains a list and `flat_list` is extended with the result of applying `func_1` to `i`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` is a list containing the value of `i`.***
