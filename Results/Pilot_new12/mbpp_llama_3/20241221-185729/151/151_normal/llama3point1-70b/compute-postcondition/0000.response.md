The code initializes an empty list `flat_list`. The initial state states that `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements. The code does not modify `nested_list` in any way. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, `flat_list` is an empty list**
