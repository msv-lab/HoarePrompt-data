The code extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the second element of `nested_list`. 

The state of `nested_list` is not affected, so it remains a list with at least 2 elements. The state of `i` is also not affected, so it remains the second element of `nested_list`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` now contains the additional elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`**
