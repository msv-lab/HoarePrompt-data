To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state provides that `nested_list` is a list with at least one element.
2. `i` is specified as the first element of `nested_list`.
3. `flat_list` is an empty list.
4. The type of `i` is not a list.

Given the code `flat_list.append(i)`, this operation adds the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. 

Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and its type is not a list, `i` can be any type of object that is not a list (e.g., integer, string, tuple, etc.). The specific type of `i` isn't specified, but we know it's not a list.

After executing `flat_list.append(i)`, `flat_list` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`. The state of `nested_list` and the fact that `i` is its first element remain unchanged, as does the condition that `i` is not a list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is not a list, `flat_list` contains one element which is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is not a list, `flat_list` is a list containing the value of `i`.**
