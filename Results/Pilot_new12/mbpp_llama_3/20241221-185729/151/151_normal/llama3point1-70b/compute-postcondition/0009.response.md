To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given Initial State: 
- `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is an existing list.

Given Code:
```python
flat_list.append(i)
```

This code appends the value of `i` (which is the second element of `nested_list`) to `flat_list`.

Output State:
- `nested_list` is still a list with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is still the second element of `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` now includes the second element of `nested_list` as its last element, which means `flat_list` now contains all its previous elements plus `i` (the second element of `nested_list`) as the new last element.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact elements of `nested_list` or `flat_list`, and `flat_list` is not described in the initial state but affected in the code, the most accurate description we can provide for the output state, considering the provided details, is:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the second element of `nested_list` (`i`) as its last element.**
