According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.
State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`**
