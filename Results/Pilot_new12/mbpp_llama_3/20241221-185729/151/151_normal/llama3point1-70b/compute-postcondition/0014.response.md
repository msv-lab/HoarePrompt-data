Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the return value of `func_1(i)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the third element of `nested_list` as its last element.***
