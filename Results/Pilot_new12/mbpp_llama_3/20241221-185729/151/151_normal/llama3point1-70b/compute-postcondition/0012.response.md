To determine the output state, we analyze the given code and initial state.

Given Initial State: `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
```

This line of code extends `flat_list` with the return value of `func_1(i)`. 

Since we don't know what `func_1` does or what `flat_list` initially contains, we can only describe the change in terms of the function's return value.

- `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the code.
- `i` remains the third element of `nested_list` as `i`'s value is not changed by the code.
- `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact elements added, but we know `flat_list` now contains these additional elements.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the return value of `func_1(i)`**
