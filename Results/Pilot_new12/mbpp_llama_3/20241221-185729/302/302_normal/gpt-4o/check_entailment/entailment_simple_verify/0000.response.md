The original assessment claims that the provided function, `func_1`, is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array and that it is correct. 

Upon examining the code, it's clear that the function uses a modified binary search algorithm. The key insight here is how it handles the case when the middle element (`arr[mid]`) is equal to the target. In such a case, it updates `result` with the current `mid` index and then moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This effectively continues the search on the left half of the array to find the first occurrence of the target.

The annotated version of the code supports this behavior by stating the conditions at the end of the loop: if the original value of `target` is in `arr`, then `result` is the index of the first occurrence of the original value of `target` in `arr`, otherwise `result` is -1. This aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the function's behavior:
1. **Initialization**: The function correctly initializes the pointers and the result variable.
2. **Binary Search**: It performs a modified binary search that is suitable for finding the first occurrence of an element in a sorted array.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the case when the target is not found by returning -1.
4. **Sorted Array**: The function's assumptions about the input array being sorted are correctly noted.

Given the provided assertions and the explanation in the original assessment, there's no evidence to suggest that the function does not meet the problem description. The annotated version reinforces the correctness of the original assessment by detailing the state of the program at critical points.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, the original assessment, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
