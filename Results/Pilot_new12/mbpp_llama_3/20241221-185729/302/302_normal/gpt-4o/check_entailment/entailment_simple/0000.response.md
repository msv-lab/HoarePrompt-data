Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. This sets up a binary search range.
2. Inside the while loop, the function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current search range.
3. If the value at the midpoint `arr[mid]` is equal to the target, the function updates the `result` variable with the midpoint index and adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This is a key step in finding the first occurrence of the target value. By moving the `high` pointer to the left, the function ensures that it will continue searching for a potentially earlier occurrence of the target value.
4. If the value at the midpoint is less than the target, the function moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`. This rules out the left half of the current search range.
5. If the value at the midpoint is greater than the target, the function moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This rules out the right half of the current search range.
6. The loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
7. After the loop, the function returns the `result` variable, which holds the index of the first occurrence of the target value if it was found, or -1 if it was not found.

The program is correct because it uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the first occurrence of the target value in the sorted array. The key insight is that when the function finds a match, it does not immediately return the index. Instead, it continues searching to the left of the match to ensure that it finds the first occurrence of the target value.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly in different scenarios, such as when the target value appears multiple times, when it appears only once, and when it does not appear at all. Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
