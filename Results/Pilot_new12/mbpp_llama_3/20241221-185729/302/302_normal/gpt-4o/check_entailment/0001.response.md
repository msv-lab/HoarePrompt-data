Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a binary search implementation to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The code is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program uses a binary search approach, which is suitable for finding an element in a sorted array.
2. The `low` and `high` variables are initialized correctly to represent the range of the array.
3. When the `mid` element is found to be equal to the `target`, the `result` is updated, and the `high` pointer is moved to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence.
4. The `low` and `high` pointers are updated correctly based on the comparison between the `mid` element and the `target`.
5. The program returns the index of the first occurrence of the `target` element if it exists in the array; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The provided unit tests also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program. The code handles edge cases, such as when the `target` is not present in the array or when it's the first or last element, correctly. Therefore, the program is correct, and its correctness is **True**.
