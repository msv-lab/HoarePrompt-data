Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The algorithm works as follows:

1. It maintains two pointers, `low` and `high`, representing the current search range.
2. It calculates the `mid` index within the current search range.
3. If the element at the `mid` index is equal to the target, it updates the `result` variable with the `mid` index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence on the left side.
4. If the element at the `mid` index is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to continue searching on the right side.
5. If the element at the `mid` index is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching on the left side.

The algorithm continues until the search range is empty (`low` is greater than `high`).

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm for various scenarios, including:

* Finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array with duplicate elements.
* Finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array without duplicate elements.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the algorithm's behavior, such as handling edge cases like an empty list or a list with duplicate elements.

Since the algorithm correctly implements the binary search approach to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios, the code is correct for every potential case.
