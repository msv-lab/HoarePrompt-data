Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It uses a modified binary search algorithm to achieve this. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also sets `result` to -1, which will store the index of the first occurrence of the target number.

2. **Binary Search**: The function performs a binary search, calculating the `mid` index and comparing the middle element to the target. If the middle element is equal to the target, it updates `result` with the current `mid` index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the function continues searching for the first occurrence of the target on the left side of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. If the target is not found, it returns -1, which is a common convention for indicating that an element is not present in the array.

4. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes that the input array is sorted, which is a requirement for binary search to work correctly. Given this assumption, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs.

I have analyzed the code and considered various scenarios, including:

* The target is present at the start of the array.
* The target is present in the middle of the array.
* The target is present at the end of the array.
* The target is not present in the array.
* The array contains duplicate elements.

In all these cases, the function appears to work correctly, returning the index of the first occurrence of the target number or -1 if the target is not found. Since I couldn't find any counterexamples, I conclude that the code is correct.
