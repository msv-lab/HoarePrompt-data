You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a binary search implementation to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The code is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program uses a binary search approach, which is suitable for finding an element in a sorted array.
2. The `low` and `high` variables are initialized correctly to represent the range of the array.
3. When the `mid` element is found to be equal to the `target`, the `result` is updated, and the `high` pointer is moved to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence.
4. The `low` and `high` pointers are updated correctly based on the comparison between the `mid` element and the `target`.
5. The program returns the index of the first occurrence of the `target` element if it exists in the array; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The provided unit tests also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program. The code handles edge cases, such as when the `target` is not present in the array or when it's the first or last element, correctly. Therefore, the program is correct, and its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1. The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted, and the function does not modify the input list. The function handles edge cases where the target is not in the list, and it also handles cases where the list is empty or contains duplicate elements. If the target is in the list, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target, not the last occurrence or any other occurrence. If the list is empty, the function returns -1. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a list and an integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
