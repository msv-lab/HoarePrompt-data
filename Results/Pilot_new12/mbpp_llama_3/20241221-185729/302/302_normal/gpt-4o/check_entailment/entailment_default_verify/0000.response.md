The original assessment concludes that the provided code is correct, with reasons that include proper initialization, a correctly implemented binary search algorithm, and handling of edge cases. The output hints support this conclusion by describing the code's functionality in a manner that aligns with the problem description and indicating that it correctly handles various cases, including the target not being in the list, empty lists, and lists with duplicate elements.

Upon reviewing the code and the provided information, it's evident that the function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function uses a modified binary search algorithm that, upon finding the target, continues to search on the left side for any earlier occurrences. This ensures that it finds the first occurrence of the target number, meeting the problem's requirements.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected: it returns the index of the first occurrence of the target if found, and -1 otherwise. It also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with duplicate elements, without modifying the input list. Although the function does not perform error checking on the input type, the assumption that the input will always be valid (a sorted list and an integer) is stated, which means the user is expected to provide inputs that will not cause errors.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment that the code is correct is accurate. The code effectively implements a binary search algorithm tailored to find the first occurrence of a target in a sorted list, addressing the problem description's requirements and handling various scenarios as outlined in the output hints.

Final: **True**
