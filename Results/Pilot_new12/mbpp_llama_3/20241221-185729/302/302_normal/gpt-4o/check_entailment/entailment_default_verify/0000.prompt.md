You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It uses a modified binary search algorithm to achieve this. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also sets `result` to -1, which will store the index of the first occurrence of the target number.

2. **Binary Search**: The function performs a binary search, calculating the `mid` index and comparing the middle element to the target. If the middle element is equal to the target, it updates `result` with the current `mid` index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the function continues searching for the first occurrence of the target on the left side of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. If the target is not found, it returns -1, which is a common convention for indicating that an element is not present in the array.

4. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes that the input array is sorted, which is a requirement for binary search to work correctly. Given this assumption, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs.

I have analyzed the code and considered various scenarios, including:

* The target is present at the start of the array.
* The target is present in the middle of the array.
* The target is present at the end of the array.
* The target is not present in the array.
* The array contains duplicate elements.

In all these cases, the function appears to work correctly, returning the index of the first occurrence of the target number or -1 if the target is not found. Since I couldn't find any counterexamples, I conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1. The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted, and the function does not modify the input list. The function handles edge cases where the target is not in the list, and it also handles cases where the list is empty or contains duplicate elements. If the target is in the list, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target, not the last occurrence or any other occurrence. If the list is empty, the function returns -1. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a list and an integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
