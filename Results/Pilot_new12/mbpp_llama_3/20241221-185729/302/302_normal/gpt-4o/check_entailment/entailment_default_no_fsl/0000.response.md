Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `target` in a sorted array `arr`. The function uses a modified binary search algorithm to achieve this.

Here's why I believe the function works correctly for every potential case:

1.  **Handling Edge Cases:** The function handles edge cases such as when the target is not in the list, when the list is empty, and when the list contains duplicate elements. If the target is not in the list, the function returns -1. If the list is empty, the function also returns -1 because the while loop condition `low <= high` is not met, so the function does not enter the loop and the initial value of `result` (-1) is returned.

2.  **Finding the First Occurrence:** The function is designed to find the first occurrence of the target in the sorted array. When it finds the target at the mid index, it updates the `result` variable with the mid index and then moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures that if there are duplicate occurrences of the target, the function continues searching for the first occurrence on the left side of the mid index.

3.  **Correctness for All Cases:** Assuming the input will always be a valid sorted list and a target integer, the function should work correctly for all cases. The provided unit tests in the problem description demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including when the target is present in the list with duplicates, when the target is present without duplicates, and when the list is empty or contains duplicate elements.

4.  **Modified Binary Search:** The function's use of a modified binary search algorithm allows it to efficiently search for the target in the sorted array, ensuring that the time complexity remains O(log n), where n is the length of the array. This makes the function efficient for large inputs.

In summary, based on the provided code and the problem description, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs. It handles edge cases, finds the first occurrence of the target, and uses an efficient modified binary search algorithm.
