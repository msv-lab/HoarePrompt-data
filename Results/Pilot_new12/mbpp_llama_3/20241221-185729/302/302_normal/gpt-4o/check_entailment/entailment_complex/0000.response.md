Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. It correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- It uses a binary search approach, which is suitable for a sorted array.
- If the middle element is equal to the target, it updates the result with the middle index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching on the left half. This ensures that it finds the first occurrence of the target.
- If the middle element is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search on the right half.
- If the middle element is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search on the left half.
- The program handles edge cases where the target is not in the list, and it also handles cases where the list is empty or contains duplicate elements.
- If the target is in the list, the program returns the index of the first occurrence of the target, not the last occurrence or any other occurrence.

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the program for different scenarios. 

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description, and it should work correctly for all potential cases as long as the input is a sorted list of integers and a target integer.
