The code updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. The initial state provides that `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. 

After the code is executed, `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, which means `low` is now equal to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is equal to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is less than `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is equal to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is less than `high`**
