To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the while loop: `low <= high`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals the index of `target` in `arr` and is equal to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and if `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- In all cases, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2` initially, but may have changed.
- `result` may have changed to the index of `target` in `arr` if `arr[mid]` equals `target`.

The loop can execute again if `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Given the updates, if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `high` is set to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`, which does not guarantee that `low` will be less than or equal to `high` after the update, especially considering that `low` could have been updated to `mid + 1` in the previous iteration if `arr[mid]` was less than `target`. 

However, the critical insight here is that for the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, the update of `high` to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1` suggests a specific handling when the target is found, but this does not inherently prevent the loop from continuing if `low` is appropriately positioned. 

If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and if `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The loop's ability to execute again depends on the relative positions of `low` and `high` after these updates.

Considering the updates and the requirement for `low` to be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute again, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `low` is indeed less than or equal to `high` after the previous iteration's updates. Since `arr` is a non-empty sorted list and the updates of `low` and `high` are based on comparisons of `arr[mid]` with `target`, the condition that needs to be maintained or adjusted is the relationship between `low` and `high` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
