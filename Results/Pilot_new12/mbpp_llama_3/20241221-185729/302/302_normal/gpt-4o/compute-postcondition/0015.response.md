To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to consider the initial state and how the code affects it.

Initial State: 
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Code Snippet:
```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

This line of code calculates the middle index (`mid`) of a range defined by `low` and `high` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.

Given the formula `mid = (low + high) // 2`, `mid` will always be an integer because `(low + high)` is divided by 2 using integer division. The value of `mid` will be the integer part of the average of `low` and `high`, effectively rounding down if the sum of `low` and `high` is odd.

Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, and considering the properties of integer division, `mid` will be either equal to `low` (if `high` is `low` or `low + 1`), or it will be a value between `low` and `high` inclusive.

Output State: 
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest whole number, i.e., `mid = (low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`.**
