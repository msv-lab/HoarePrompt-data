Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. `result` and `mid` may have changed, but the exact changes are not specified. The element at index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`.***
