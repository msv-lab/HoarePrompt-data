The code updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. The initial state provides the following information: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` equals the index of `target` in `arr` and is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.

Given that `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, the new value of `high` will be `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`. The other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the updated state reflects the change in `high` while keeping the other conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`, `result` equals the index of `target` in `arr` and is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.**
