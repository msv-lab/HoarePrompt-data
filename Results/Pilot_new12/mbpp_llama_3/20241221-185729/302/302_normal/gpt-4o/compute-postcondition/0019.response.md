The code changes the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. Since `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this expression into the new value of `high`. So, `high` becomes `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. However, this expression still depends on the old value of `high`. To simplify, we keep in mind that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and now `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. The new `high` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1`. 

The condition that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` is still valid after the code has been executed because `high` becomes `mid - 1`, and since `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `mid - 1` will still be greater than or equal to `low` given that the list is non-empty and sorted.

Given that `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers and `target` is an integer, these conditions are not affected by the change in `high`. 

The value of `mid` is calculated based on `low` and `high`, but since `high` has been updated, if `mid` were to be recalculated, it would be based on the new `high`. However, the code snippet only updates `high` without recalculating `mid`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `mid` equals `(low + (previous high)) // 2` (noting that `mid` was calculated before `high` was updated).

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `mid` equals `(low + (previous high)) // 2`.**
