To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than `high`.
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.
- `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

The given code is:
```python
high = mid - 1
```

From the code, we can see that `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. 

Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this into the update for `high`:
```python
high = ((low + high) // 2) - 1
```
However, this substitution isn't necessary for understanding the impact on `high` since we know `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` becomes `mid - 1`.

Given that `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, and now `high` equals `mid - 1`, we can express `high` in terms of its original relationship, but it's more important to note that `high` has decreased, which implies that the range `[low, high]` has narrowed.

- `arr` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is still an integer.
- The relationship between `low` and `high` has changed because `high` is now less than its previous value, but `low` is still less than the new `high` since `high` is reduced to `mid - 1`, maintaining the inequality.
- `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, but its value would change if recalculated with the new `high`, specifically `mid` would now be less than its original value if recalculated.
- `result` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`, but considering `high` has changed, if we were to recalculate `result` based on the new `high`, its value would also change to reflect the updated average of `low` and the new `high`.

However, the code only updates `high`, so `mid` and `result`'s relationship to the original `low` and `high` values is now outdated, but their current values do not change due to this specific line of code.

Therefore, considering the changes:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than `high`, where `high` is now `mid - 1`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, but its value would change if recalculated.
- `result` equals `(low + high) // 2`, which also implies its value would change if recalculated with the new `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, `high` equals `mid - 1`, `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` equals `(low + high) // 2`, with the understanding that `mid` and `result` are based on the original `low` and `high` unless recalculated.**
