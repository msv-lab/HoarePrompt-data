The value of `result` is updated to `mid`. The current value of `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, but the specific values of `mid` and `target` are not provided. However, it is given that `mid` was initially `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is `mid`, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. Since `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, it can also be said that `result` equals the index of `target` in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` equals the index of `target` in `arr` and is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.**
