The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. The previous value of `low` is not specified, but since `mid` is an index in `arr` where the element at this index is less than `target`, `mid + 1` will be the new lower bound for the search. The values of `arr`, `target`, `high`, and `result` are not affected by this code. The value of `mid` is still an index in `arr` where the element at this index is less than `target`, but it is not updated in this code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is not specified, `result` is not specified, and `mid` is an index in `arr` where the element at this index is less than `target`.**
