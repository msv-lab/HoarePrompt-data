The code assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `result`. The value of `mid` is given as `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` equals `(low + high) // 2`**
