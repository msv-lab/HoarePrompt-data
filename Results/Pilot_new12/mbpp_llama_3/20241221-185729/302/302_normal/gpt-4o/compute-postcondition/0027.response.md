To calculate the output state, we consider the impact of the given code on the program. The code `high = mid - 1` changes the value of `high` to be one less than `mid`. 

Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, we substitute this into the equation for the new `high`:
- New `high` = `mid - 1` = `((low + high) // 2) - 1`.

However, for understanding the output state, we focus on the relationships and the fact that `high` is updated, not necessarily simplifying this expression further since it involves the old value of `high`. The key point is that `high` is reduced, which means the range defined by `low` and `high` is narrowed down.

Considering the initial state:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than `high`.
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

After executing `high = mid - 1`:
- The value of `arr`, `target`, and `low` remains unchanged.
- The new value of `high` is `mid - 1`, which means `high` is now less than its previous value, narrowing the range between `low` and `high`.
- Since `mid` was initially defined as `(low + high) // 2`, its value would also be impacted by the change in `high`, but the code provided does not update `mid`. Thus, the relationship of `mid` being the average of `low` and `high` no longer holds with the new `high`. `mid`'s relation to the updated `high` and the original `low` would be different.

Therefore, the output state, focusing on the provided and derived information:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than the new `high`.
- The new `high` is `mid - 1`, where `mid` was originally `(low + high) // 2`, but now `high` has been updated.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than the new `high`, and the new `high` is `mid - 1`, where `mid` was originally `(low + high) // 2`.**
