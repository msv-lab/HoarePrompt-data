To calculate the result, let's think step by step about the impact of the code on the program. The code `result = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. The value of `mid` is given as `(low + high) // 2`, which means `mid` is the integer average of `low` and `high`. 

Given that `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, after executing the code, `result` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is equal to `mid` which is `(low + high) // 2`.
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
