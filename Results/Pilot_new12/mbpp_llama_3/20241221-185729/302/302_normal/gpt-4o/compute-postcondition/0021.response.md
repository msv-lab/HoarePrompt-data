Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, with `mid` recalculated as the average of the new `low` and `high` in subsequent iterations, maintaining the condition that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.***
