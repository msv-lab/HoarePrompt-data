To calculate the result, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the middle index of the current range defined by `low` and `high`. 

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` must be less than `high` to ensure another iteration can occur, considering the updates to `low` and `high` based on `mid`.

The code calculates `mid` as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. This means `mid` will be the index that is exactly in the middle of the range from `low` to `high`. 

Since `arr` is sorted and `low` and `high` define a range within this sorted list, `mid` effectively splits this range into two halves. The value of `mid` is now equal to the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer due to the integer division.

The states of `arr` and `target` are not affected by this operation. Only `mid` is assigned a new value based on the current values of `low` and `high`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
