According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. Since `low` is already less than or equal to `high` when `arr` is not empty, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one time, given that the list `arr` is not empty. If the list `arr` is empty, `high` would be -1, and thus `low` would be greater than `high`, preventing the loop from executing. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must not be empty.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1**
