Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, initially `low` was 0, initially `high` was `len(arr) - 1`, initially `result` was -1, and initially `mid` was `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. The current value of `mid` is an index in `arr` where the element at this index is not equal to `target` and is less than `target`. The current values of `low`, `high`, and `result` are not specified by the if condition, but `arr`, `target`, and the relation of `mid` to `arr` and `target` are as previously described with the additional condition that the element at index `mid` in `arr` is less than `target`.**
