To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `while low <= high:`. This means the loop can execute again if the condition `low <= high` is still met.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high`. The updates inside the loop (whether `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, or `high` is updated to `mid - 1`) are based on comparisons involving `arr[mid]` and `target`, but these do not change the fact that for another iteration to occur, `low` must not exceed `high`.

Since `low` is updated to `mid + 1` when `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1` in other cases, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to guarantee that after these updates, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. 

However, from the given state, we only know that `low` is less than or equal to `high` at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to definitely execute again, considering the updates that can occur, we need to ensure that any potential update based on `mid` does not cause `low` to exceed `high`. 

Given that `arr` is sorted, `target` is an integer, and the way `low` and `high` are updated, if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, implying `low` could be less than or equal to `mid - 1` for the loop to potentially continue if `low` is not updated beyond `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` becomes `mid + 1`, which means for the loop to continue, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` becomes `mid - 1`, which inherently satisfies the condition since `low` would be less than or equal to `mid` before this update.

Given the provided state and the need for `low` to be less than or equal to `high` for another iteration, without specific knowledge of `arr[mid]`'s relation to `target` at the end of the last iteration, we can conclude that for the loop to certainly execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be maintainable after any potential update. Since `low` and `high` are dynamic based on `mid`, and `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, for the loop to execute again, it must be possible for `low` to be less than or equal to `high` after an update.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `low` and `high` are such that, after any update based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. This inherently means that the gap between `low` and `high` must allow for at least one more iteration where `low` does not exceed `high` after updating `low` or `high` based on `mid`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `low` must be less than `high` to ensure another iteration can occur, considering the updates to `low` and `high` based on `mid`.**
