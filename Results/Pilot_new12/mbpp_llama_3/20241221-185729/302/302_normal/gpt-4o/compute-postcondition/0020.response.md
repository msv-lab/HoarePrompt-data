Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains greater than or equal to `low`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, with `mid` recalculated as the average of the new `low` and the previous `high`.**
