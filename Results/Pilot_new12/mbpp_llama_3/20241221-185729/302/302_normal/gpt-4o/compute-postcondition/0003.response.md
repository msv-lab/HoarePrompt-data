To calculate the result, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `mid = (low + high) // 2`: This line calculates the middle index of the current range `[low, high]` in the list `arr`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `result` is -1.

The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `mid` will be `(0 + len(arr) - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.

The states of `arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`, and `result` are not affected by this line of code. Only `mid` is assigned a new value based on `low` and `high`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
