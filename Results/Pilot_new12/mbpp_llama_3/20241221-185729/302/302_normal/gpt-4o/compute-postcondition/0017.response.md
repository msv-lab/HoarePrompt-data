The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Since `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this expression into the new value of `high`. So, `high` becomes `((low + high) // 2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`arr` is still a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is still an integer, `low` is still less than or equal to the new `high`, and `result` and `mid` are still equal to `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `high`. However, after the update of `high`, `mid` is no longer equal to `(low + high) // 2` because `high` has changed. 

The new value of `mid` can be calculated using the updated value of `high`. Since `high` equals `mid - 1`, we can express `mid` as `high + 1`. Substituting the expression for `high` before the update, `mid` equals `((low + high) // 2)`. Substituting the updated expression for `high` into the equation for `mid`, `mid` equals `((low + (mid - 1)) // 2)`. However, we should use the original expression for `mid` which is `(low + high) // 2` to maintain consistency with the initial state.

The new `high` is `mid - 1` which is `((low + high) // 2) - 1`. The `result` is still `(low + high) // 2` but `high` has been updated. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `high`, `result` equals `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `high`, and `high` equals `mid - 1` or `((low + high) // 2) - 1` where `high` is the original `high`. 

For clarity, we can express `high` as the original `high` minus 1, which was equal to `(low + high) // 2`. 
Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `high`, `result` equals `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `high`, and `high` equals `((low + high) // 2) - 1`**
