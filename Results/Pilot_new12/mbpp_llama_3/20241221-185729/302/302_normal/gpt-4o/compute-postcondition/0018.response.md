The code updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. The previous values of `arr`, `target`, `high`, and `mid` are still valid. Since `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, we can substitute the expression for `mid` into the new value of `low`. However, we do not need to do that here because the new value of `low` is simply `mid + 1`, and `mid` is still equal to `(low + high) // 2` before it was updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `mid + 1`, and `high` is still greater than or equal to `low`, and `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` before it was updated to be `(low + high) // 2` where `low` equals `mid + 1` but this relation is not valid anymore for the new `low` but is valid for the old `low`. But `mid` was calculated in terms of `low` so now `mid` should also be updated in terms of `low`. Since we are not doing that here we will just use `mid` equals `(old low + high) // 2` which is also `mid` equals `(mid -1 + high) // 2` in terms of new `low`. `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
However, all the above can be avoided and we can simply state that `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` equals `mid + 1` which equals `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, `mid` equals `(old low + high) // 2`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. But since the relation between the old `low` and `high` and `mid` is `mid` equals `(old low + high) // 2`, then the new `low` equals `mid + 1` equals `((old low + high) // 2) + 1`. And since the old `low` is less than or equal to `high`, then `mid` equals `(old low + high) // 2` is also less than or equal to `high` and `mid + 1` is less than or equal to `high`. 

However, if we need to be precise about the output state in terms of the fact that `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, we should write it as: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` equals `mid + 1`, `mid` equals `((low -1) + high) // 2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. But since `low` equals `mid + 1` equals `((old low + high) // 2) + 1`, we should replace `low` in `mid` equals `((low -1) + high) // 2` with `mid + 1`. Therefore, `mid` equals `(((mid + 1) -1) + high) // 2` equals `(mid + high) // 2`. Which will be `mid` equals `(mid + high) // 2` or `2 * mid` equals `mid + high` or `mid` equals `high`. But the relation `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` was before updating `low`. Therefore, the output state can be written in a more simplified way without talking about the relation `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` and just state `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` equals `mid + 1`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `low`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` equals `mid + 1`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `low`**
