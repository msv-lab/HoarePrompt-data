Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals the index of `target` in `arr` and is equal to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and if `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. In all cases, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2` initially, but may have changed. `result` may have changed to the index of `target` in `arr` if `arr[mid]` equals `target`.***
