Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `high` equals `mid - 1`, `result` equals `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is less than `high`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and remains less than `high`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `low` remains less than the new `high`.**
