The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous value of `high` was `len(arr) - 1`, but this change does not affect the value of `high` because `high` is now directly assigned the value `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, so `high` becomes `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, the element at index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`, and `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`**
