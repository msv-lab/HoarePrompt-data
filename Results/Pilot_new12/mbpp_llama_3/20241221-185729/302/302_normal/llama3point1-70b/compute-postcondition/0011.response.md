The code provided returns -1, which means it does not return the index of `num` in `arr` or any value related to the initial state variables `arr` and `num`. Instead, it returns a fixed value indicating that `num` is not found in `arr`, even though the initial state suggests a conditional return based on whether `num` is in `arr`. Since the return statement is explicit and does not depend on the condition of `num` being in `arr`, the program returns -1 regardless of the initial state conditions.

Output State: **The program returns -1**
