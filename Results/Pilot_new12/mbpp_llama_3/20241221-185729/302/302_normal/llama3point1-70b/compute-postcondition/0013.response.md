Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as input, and returns the index of `num` in `arr` if it exists, or -1 if it does not. The function performs a linear search through the list to find the index of `num`. The potential return values are the indices of `num` in the list (0, 1, 2, etc.) if `num` is found, or -1 if `num` is not found in the list. The input list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function. The function handles edge cases where `num` is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty (in which case it will also return -1, although this case is not explicitly handled in the annotations). The return value can be any integer index within the bounds of the list, not limited to 0, 1, 2, or -1 as suggested by the return postconditions.**
