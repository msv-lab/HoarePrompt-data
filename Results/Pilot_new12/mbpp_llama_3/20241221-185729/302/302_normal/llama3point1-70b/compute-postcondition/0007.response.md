According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` and the current index `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list and is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2, and `x` will be the third element in the list. The loop will only execute again if `arr` has at least 3 elements.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list**
