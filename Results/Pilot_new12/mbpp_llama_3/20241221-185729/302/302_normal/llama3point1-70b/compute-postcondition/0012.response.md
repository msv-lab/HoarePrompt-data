The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `num` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer value based on certain conditions. The possible return values are 0, 1, 2, or -1. Since the conditions for each return value are not specified, we can only describe the function's functionality in general terms.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and returns an integer value of 0, 1, 2, or -1 based on the input parameters.**
