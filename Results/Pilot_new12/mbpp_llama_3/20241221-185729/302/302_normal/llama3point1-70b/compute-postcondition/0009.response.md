Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in the list. If `x` is equal to `num`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables and no return value is specified.***
