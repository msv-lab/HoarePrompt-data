According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr` and the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is an integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, and `x` is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Also, since `i` is now 1, `x` must be the second element in the list. For this to be possible, `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
