You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a simple function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It uses the enumerate function to iterate over the array and checks if the current element is equal to the given number. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element. If no match is found after iterating over the entire array, it returns -1.

The program works correctly for the following cases:

- When the given number is present in the array, it returns the correct index.
- When the given number is not present in the array, it returns -1.
- When the array is empty, it returns -1 (because enumerate will not iterate over any elements).

The program also works correctly for a sorted array, because it simply returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number, regardless of the order of the elements (although, the problem description does mention a sorted array, it doesn't affect the correctness of the function in this case). 

This program does not utilize the fact that the array is sorted, but it still finds the first occurrence of the number, which meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num` as input, and returns the index of `num` in `arr` if it exists, or -1 if it does not. The function performs a linear search through the list to find the index of `num`. The potential return values are the indices of `num` in the list (0, 1, 2, etc.) if `num` is found, or -1 if `num` is not found in the list. The input list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function. The function handles edge cases where `num` is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty (in which case it will also return -1, although this case is not explicitly handled in the annotations). The return value can be any integer index within the bounds of the list, not limited to 0, 1, 2, or -1 as suggested by the return postconditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
