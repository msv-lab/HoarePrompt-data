Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the provided program returns -1 when the number is not found in the array but also returns -1 is never reached due to the implicit return of `None` when `num` is not in `arr` (as specified in the state of the program after the for loop has been executed). 

A linear search is performed by the function, which will return the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr`, as required by the problem description, if `num` is found. However, in the case where `num` is not found, the program will return `None` rather than -1, since the return statement `return -1` is never reached due to the implicit return of `None`.

To fix this issue and make the program follow the problem description, the implicit return of `None` should be avoided. Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1
```
