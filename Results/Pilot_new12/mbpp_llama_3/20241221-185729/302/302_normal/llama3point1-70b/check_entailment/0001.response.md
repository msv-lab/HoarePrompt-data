Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The description states that the function should find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a **sorted** array. However, the code provided does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. 

A case where the program does not work correctly as per the description is when it does not utilize the property of a sorted array to potentially improve efficiency. For instance, in a sorted array, if the target number is larger than the current element being compared, the function should continue to the next element without checking previous elements again, but the given code does not implement this logic. It simply checks each element in sequence, which is inefficient for large sorted arrays.

To correctly and efficiently solve this problem, a binary search algorithm should be used, which takes advantage of the sorted property of the array to find the target number more quickly. 

Here's an example of how the function could be implemented correctly:

```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] < num:
            left = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > num:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            # Check if this is the first occurrence
            if mid == 0 or arr[mid - 1]!= num:
                return mid
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
This version of the function uses binary search to efficiently find the target number in the sorted array and then checks to ensure it returns the index of the first occurrence.
