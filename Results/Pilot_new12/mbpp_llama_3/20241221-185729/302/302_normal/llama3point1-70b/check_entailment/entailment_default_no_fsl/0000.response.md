Correctness: **False**

The given program does not take into account that the input array is sorted. It performs a linear search through the list, which is not the most efficient approach for finding an element in a sorted array. A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log n) compared to the linear search's time complexity of O(n).

In the given code, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the array, but it does not utilize the fact that the array is sorted. This makes the code less efficient than it could be.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the target number is `3`, the given code will still work correctly and return the index `2`. However, if the array is very large, the code's inefficiency will become apparent.

A correct implementation would utilize the fact that the array is sorted and use a binary search algorithm to find the target number. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == num:
            if mid == 0 or arr[mid-1]!= num:
                return mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < num:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

This implementation uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the sorted array and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target number. If the target number is not found, it returns -1.
