Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a sorted array `arr` and a target number `num` as inputs.
2. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element.
3. If it finds a match between the current element `x` and the target number `num`, it immediately returns the index `i`.
4. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`.

This implementation meets the problem description because it:

* Finds the index of the first occurrence of the given number `num` in the sorted array `arr`.
* Returns the index of the first occurrence if `num` is found in the array.
* Returns `-1` if `num` is not found in the array.

The program's correctness is due to the following reasons:

* The `enumerate` function ensures that the index `i` is correct for each element `x`.
* The `if` condition checks for an exact match between `x` and `num`, ensuring that the correct index is returned.
* The function returns `-1` when `num` is not found, which is a common convention for indicating that an element is not present in the array.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases (finding the first occurrence of `num` or returning `-1` if not found), it is considered correct.
