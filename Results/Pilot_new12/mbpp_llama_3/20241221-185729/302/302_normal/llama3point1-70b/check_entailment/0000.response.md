Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a simple function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It uses the enumerate function to iterate over the array and checks if the current element is equal to the given number. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element. If no match is found after iterating over the entire array, it returns -1.

The program works correctly for the following cases:

- When the given number is present in the array, it returns the correct index.
- When the given number is not present in the array, it returns -1.
- When the array is empty, it returns -1 (because enumerate will not iterate over any elements).

The program also works correctly for a sorted array, because it simply returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number, regardless of the order of the elements (although, the problem description does mention a sorted array, it doesn't affect the correctness of the function in this case). 

This program does not utilize the fact that the array is sorted, but it still finds the first occurrence of the number, which meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
