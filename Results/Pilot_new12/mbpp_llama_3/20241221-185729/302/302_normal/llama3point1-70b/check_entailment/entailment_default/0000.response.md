Correctness: **False**.

The code is incorrect because it performs a linear search through the list, which does not take advantage of the fact that the input list is sorted. A linear search has a time complexity of O(n), whereas a more efficient approach for finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array would be to use a binary search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log n). 

Moreover, if there are duplicate occurrences of the given number in the sorted list, the function will return the index of the first one it encounters, which is correct. However, the fact that the input list is sorted is not utilized in the given function. The function does not break the search once it has found the first occurrence if the number appears multiple times, which could be further optimized.

Additionally, the function does handle edge cases such as when the list is empty or the number is not found, but it does not explicitly handle these cases. It will return -1 in both scenarios, which is correct according to the problem description. However, since the function is supposed to find the index in a sorted array, and it does not utilize the property of a sorted array, it is considered incorrect for this specific problem description. 

An example of a case where the program could be optimized is when the input list is very large and the target number is near the end of the list. In such a case, a binary search algorithm would be much more efficient than the linear search used in the given function. 

To correctly solve this problem, the function should utilize the property of a sorted array and implement a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of the given number.
