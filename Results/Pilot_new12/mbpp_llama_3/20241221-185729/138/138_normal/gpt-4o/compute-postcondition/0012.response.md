The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value that can be compared with the elements in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value and an integer. 

The return values are as follows:
- In Case_1, if the `element` is found at index 0 in `arr`, the function returns `True` and `0`.
- In Case_2, if the `element` is found at index 1 in `arr`, the function returns `True` and `1`.
- In Case_3, if the `element` is found at index 2 in `arr`, the function returns `True` and `2`.
- In Case_4, if the `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and return a boolean indicating whether the `element` is found in `arr` along with the index of the `element` if found, or -1 if not found.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list arr and an element, returns a boolean indicating whether the element is found in arr along with the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.**
