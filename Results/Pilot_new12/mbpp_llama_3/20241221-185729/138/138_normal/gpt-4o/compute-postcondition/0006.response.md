Postcondition: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is a comparable value, `index` is 1, and `value` is the second element in `arr`. If `value` equals `element`, the program returns True and 1. Otherwise, the program returns None, with `arr`, `element`, `index`, and `value` retaining their initial states where `value` is not equal to `element`.**
