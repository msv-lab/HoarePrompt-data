According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of elements and `element` is a value that can be compared with the elements in `arr`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `arr` must have at least 1 element, `index` is 0, and `value` is the first element in the `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `element` is a value that can be compared with the elements in `arr`, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in the `arr`**
