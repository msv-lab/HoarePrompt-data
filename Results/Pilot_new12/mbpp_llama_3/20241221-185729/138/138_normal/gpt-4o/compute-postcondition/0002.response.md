The `return True, index` statement means the program will return two values: a boolean value `True` and the current value of `index`. 

Given that `index` is 0, the program returns `True` and `0`. 

Since `index` is 0, it refers to the first element in the list `arr`. The current value of `value` is equal to `element` and is also the first element in `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns True and 0, where 0 is the index of the first element in the list `arr` that matches the `element`.**
