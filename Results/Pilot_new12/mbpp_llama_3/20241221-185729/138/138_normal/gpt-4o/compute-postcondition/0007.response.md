To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `element` is a comparable value.
- `index` is 1.
- `value` is the second element in `arr`.

Loop Statement:
```python
for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `enumerate(arr)` must yield at least one more pair of `(index, value)`. This means `arr` must have at least one more element beyond the current `index` (which is 1), implying `arr` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

Since `index` is currently 1 (pointing to the second element), for the loop to execute again, `index` must increment to 2, and `value` must become the third element in `arr`.

The state of `element` does not affect the loop's ability to execute but is relevant for the comparisons within the loop body, which we are not considering for this task. The task is focused on the conditions necessary for the loop to initiate another iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `arr` must be a list with at least 3 elements.
- `element` remains unchanged as it's not directly affected by the loop iteration in terms of the loop's ability to continue.
- `index` must be 2.
- `value` must be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is a comparable value, `index` is 2, and `value` is the third element in `arr`**
