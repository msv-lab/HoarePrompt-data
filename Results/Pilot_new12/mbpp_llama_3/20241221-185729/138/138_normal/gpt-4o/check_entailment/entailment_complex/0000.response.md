Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `arr` (a list of elements) and `element` (a value that can be compared with the elements in `arr`).

2. The function uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the list `arr`. For each iteration, it checks if the current value `value` is equal to the `element`.

3. If a match is found, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index `index` of the `element` in the list.

4. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, indicating that the `element` is not in the list.

The program correctly handles all cases:

* If the `element` is in the list, it returns `True` and the index of the `element`.
* If the `element` is not in the list, it returns `False` and `-1`.
* The function performs a linear search and returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` if it is found.
* The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, always returning the index of the first occurrence of the `element` if found.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
