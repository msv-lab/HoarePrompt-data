Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an element `element` as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function uses a simple iterative approach with `enumerate` to check each element in the array. If it finds a match, it immediately returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the found element. If it iterates through the entire array without finding a match, it returns a tuple with `False` and -1, indicating the element is not in the array.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, demonstrating the function's correctness for various inputs. Additionally, the function handles cases where the element is not in the array, as shown by the return value of `(False, -1)` when no match is found.

The function's logic is straightforward and correctly implements the required functionality. There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct.
