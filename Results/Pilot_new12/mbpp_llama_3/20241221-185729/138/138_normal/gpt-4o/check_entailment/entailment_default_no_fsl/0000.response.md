Correctness: **True**

The given code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is found in the array, and an integer representing the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.

The function uses a linear search approach, iterating over the array and returning as soon as it finds a match. This approach ensures that the function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, always returning the index of the first occurrence of the element if found.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including finding an element in the middle of the array, at the end of the array, and in arrays of different sizes. Additionally, the function's behavior for edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element, is consistent with the problem description.

Since the problem description assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list and a comparable element), the function does not need to handle invalid inputs. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case, and the correctness is **True**.
