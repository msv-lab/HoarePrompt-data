The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code iterates over the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element and checks if the value matches the target element. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If no match is found after iterating over the entire array, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

The output hints provided further support the original assessment. They correctly describe the functionality of the code, including the linear search through the list, the return of the index of the first occurrence of the element if found, and the handling of edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the program appears to meet all the requirements specified in the problem description. The code handles all potential cases, including the presence and absence of the target element in the array, as well as edge cases. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct functionality of the program for different inputs.

Therefore, the original assessment of **True** is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected.

Final: **True**
