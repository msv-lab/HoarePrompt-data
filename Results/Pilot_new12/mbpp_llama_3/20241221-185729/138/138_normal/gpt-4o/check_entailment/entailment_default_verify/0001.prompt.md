You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an element `element` as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function uses a simple iterative approach with `enumerate` to check each element in the array. If it finds a match, it immediately returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the found element. If it iterates through the entire array without finding a match, it returns a tuple with `False` and -1, indicating the element is not in the array.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, demonstrating the function's correctness for various inputs. Additionally, the function handles cases where the element is not in the array, as shown by the return value of `(False, -1)` when no match is found.

The function's logic is straightforward and correctly implements the required functionality. There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a comparable `element` as input, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the `element` is found in `arr`, and an integer representing the index of the `element` if found, or -1 if not found. The function performs a linear search through the list `arr` and returns as soon as it finds a match, with the index of the first occurrence of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and -1. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, always returning the index of the first occurrence of the `element` if found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
