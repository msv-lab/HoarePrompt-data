Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a function called `func_1` that takes in an array and an element, then returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The function iterates over the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element, and checks if the value matches the target element.

The program handles all potential cases as follows:

- If the element is in the array, it returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
- If the element is not in the array, it returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element was not found.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)`, demonstrate the correct functionality of the program for different inputs. The function also works correctly for edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
