The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` accurately implements the required functionality, which is to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the `element` is found in `arr` and the index position of the `element` (or -1 if the element is not found). The function uses a simple iterative approach with `enumerate` to check each element in the array and returns as soon as it finds a match.

The output hints provided further support the correctness of the program. They confirm that the function performs a linear search through the list, returns the index of the first occurrence of the `element` if found, and handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function's logic is straightforward and that there are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I refine the assessment of the program's correctness to be consistent with the original assessment.

Final: **True**
