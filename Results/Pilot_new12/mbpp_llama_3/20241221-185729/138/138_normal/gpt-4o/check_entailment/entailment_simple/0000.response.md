Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and value of each element. This allows the function to check if the element is in the array and also keep track of its index.
2. If the function finds a match, it immediately returns `True` and the index of the element.
3. If the function completes the loop without finding a match, it returns `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element is not in the array.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If the element is in the array, the function returns `True` and the correct index.
* If the element is not in the array, the function returns `False` and `-1`.
* The function assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., a list and a comparable element, which is consistent with the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and should work correctly for all valid inputs.
