The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a comparable `element` as input, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the `element` is found in `arr`, and an integer representing the index of the `element` if found, or -1 if not found. The function performs a linear search through the list `arr` and returns as soon as it finds a match, with the index of the first occurrence of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and -1. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, always returning the index of the first occurrence of the `element` if found.
