The original assessment is accurate because it correctly evaluates the program's functionality based on the problem description. The provided code implements a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and its index position. If the element is not found, it returns False and -1.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It explicitly states that the program returns True and the 0-indexed position of 'element' in 'array' if 'element' exists in 'array', and False and -1 otherwise. This behavior aligns with the problem description.

Furthermore, the annotations confirm that the program handles both cases where the element is in the array and where it is not, returning the expected results. The try-except block correctly catches the ValueError exception raised when the element is not in the array, ensuring the program does not crash but instead returns a meaningful result.

Given that the program meets all requirements specified in the problem description and the annotations confirm its expected behavior, the original assessment of correctness is justified.

Final: **True**
