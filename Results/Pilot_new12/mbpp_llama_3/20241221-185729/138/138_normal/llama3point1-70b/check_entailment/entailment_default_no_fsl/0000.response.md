Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements of the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, checks if the element exists in the array, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the presence of the element and its index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

The program correctly handles cases where the element is in the array, not in the array, and also handles potential edge cases such as an empty input array by returning `(False, -1)`.

The function does not modify the input array or element in any way, ensuring a read-only operation. It also behaves deterministically, meaning it always returns the same output given the same inputs.

The use of a `try-except` block to catch the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method when the element is not found prevents the function from crashing and provides a predictable result.

Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or the element is not a valid type. Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the problem description for every potential valid case.
