You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array`, returning a boolean value indicating the presence of the element and its 0-indexed position if found, or -1 if not found. It handles the case where the `element` is not in the `array` by catching the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method, ensuring the function does not crash and instead returns a predictable result. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way, making it a read-only operation. The return values are a tuple containing a boolean (`True` if the element is found, `False` otherwise) and an integer (the index of the element if found, -1 if not found). The function's behavior is deterministic, meaning it will always return the same output given the same inputs, including handling edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input for either parameter, although these cases are not explicitly annotated, the function's code implies it can handle them by either returning `False` and `-1` for `None` or an empty array, or potentially throwing an exception if the inputs are not of the expected types.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
