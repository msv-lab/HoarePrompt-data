Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

The original assessment correctly points out that the program implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input, attempts to find the index of the element in the array using the `index` method, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element was found and the index of the element (or -1 if not found).

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, as it clearly states that the program returns `True` and the 0-indexed position of the element in the array if the element exists, and `False` and -1 otherwise. The state of the program after the try-except block has been executed is also correctly described, which further confirms the original assessment.

The program's behavior aligns with the problem description, and the `try-except` block correctly handles the case where the element is not found in the array. The function also handles the case where the element appears multiple times in the array by returning the index of the first occurrence, which is the expected behavior of the `index` method.

Given that the program behaves as expected for the described scenarios and does not seem to have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly, I maintain the original assessment.

Reason for maintaining the original assessment: The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and functionality, and the annotated version of the code provides further confirmation of this assessment. The program correctly implements the described functionality, and there are no apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly.

Final: **True**
