Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input, attempts to find the index of the element in the array using the `index` method, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element was found and the index of the element (or -1 if not found).

The `try-except` block is used to catch the `ValueError` exception that is raised by the `index` method if the element is not found in the array. If the element is found, the function returns `(True, index)`; otherwise, it returns `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the problem description.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the following examples:

- If the element is present in the array, the function will return `(True, index)`.
- If the element is not present in the array, the function will return `(False, -1)`.
- If the array is empty, attempting to find an element will result in a `ValueError` being raised, and the function will correctly return `(False, -1)`.
- The function handles the case where the element appears multiple times in the array by returning the index of the first occurrence, which is the expected behavior of the `index` method.

Given that the program behaves as expected for these scenarios and does not seem to have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly, the conclusion is that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
