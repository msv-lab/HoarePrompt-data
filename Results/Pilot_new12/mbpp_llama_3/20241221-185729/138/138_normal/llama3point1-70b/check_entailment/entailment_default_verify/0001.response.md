The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found).

The output hints provided also support the correctness of the program. They summarize the code's functionality, including its ability to handle the case where the element is not in the array, its read-only nature, and its deterministic behavior. The hints also mention that the function can handle edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input for either parameter, which aligns with the program's behavior.

The program's use of a `try-except` block to catch the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method ensures that it will not crash when the element is not found in the array. Instead, it will return a predictable result of `(False, -1)`. This approach is in line with the problem description's requirements.

The output hints do not provide any evidence that contradicts the original assessment. On the contrary, they reinforce the idea that the program is correct and meets the problem description's requirements.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
