Correctness: **True**.

This program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The `func_1` function takes an array and an element as input, and it returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. The `try` block uses the `index` method of the array to find the index of the given element.
2. If the element is found in the array, the `index` method returns the index, and the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index.
3. If the element is not found in the array, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block.
4. In the `except` block, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element is not found in the array.

This function handles all possible cases:

* If the element is in the array, it returns the correct index.
* If the element is not in the array, it returns -1 as the index.
* If the array is empty, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found, which is correctly handled by the `except` block.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
