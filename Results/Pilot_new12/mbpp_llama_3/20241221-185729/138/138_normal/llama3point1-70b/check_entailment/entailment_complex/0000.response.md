Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The provided Python program, `func_1`, does exactly this. It attempts to find the index of the given `element` in the `array` using the `index` method. If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the 0-indexed position of the `element`. If the `element` is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block, and the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

The program's behavior matches the problem description in all potential cases:

- If the `element` is in the `array`, the function returns `True` and the correct index.
- If the `element` is not in the `array`, the function returns `False` and -1.
- The function does not modify the input `array` or `element`, as required.

The program assumes valid input, as specified in the problem description, so it does not need to handle cases such as non-list inputs or empty lists. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
