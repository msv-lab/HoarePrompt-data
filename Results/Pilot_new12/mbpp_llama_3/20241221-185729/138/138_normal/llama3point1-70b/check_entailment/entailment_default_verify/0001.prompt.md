You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input, attempts to find the index of the element in the array using the `index` method, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element was found and the index of the element (or -1 if not found).

The `try-except` block is used to catch the `ValueError` exception that is raised by the `index` method if the element is not found in the array. If the element is found, the function returns `(True, index)`; otherwise, it returns `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the problem description.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the following examples:

- If the element is present in the array, the function will return `(True, index)`.
- If the element is not present in the array, the function will return `(False, -1)`.
- If the array is empty, attempting to find an element will result in a `ValueError` being raised, and the function will correctly return `(False, -1)`.
- The function handles the case where the element appears multiple times in the array by returning the index of the first occurrence, which is the expected behavior of the `index` method.

Given that the program behaves as expected for these scenarios and does not seem to have any edge cases that it does not handle correctly, the conclusion is that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array`, returning a boolean value indicating the presence of the element and its 0-indexed position if found, or -1 if not found. It handles the case where the `element` is not in the `array` by catching the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method, ensuring the function does not crash and instead returns a predictable result. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way, making it a read-only operation. The return values are a tuple containing a boolean (`True` if the element is found, `False` otherwise) and an integer (the index of the element if found, -1 if not found). The function's behavior is deterministic, meaning it will always return the same output given the same inputs, including handling edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input for either parameter, although these cases are not explicitly annotated, the function's code implies it can handle them by either returning `False` and `-1` for `None` or an empty array, or potentially throwing an exception if the inputs are not of the expected types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
