Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the presence of the element and its index position if found, or -1 if not found. The function uses the `index` method to find the element in the array, and catches the `ValueError` exception raised if the element is not found. This approach ensures the function behaves as described in the problem description.

The output hints agree with the code, describing the function's behavior accurately. The function does not modify the input array or element, and its return values are as specified (a tuple containing a boolean and an integer). The function's behavior is deterministic, meaning it will always return the same output given the same inputs.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function should work correctly for all potential cases. It handles the case where the element is in the array, and it handles the case where the element is not in the array by catching the `ValueError` exception. The function does not have any explicit checks for edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input, but the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` if the element is not found, which is caught by the function. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
