Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function takes in two parameters: `array` and `element`.
2. It attempts to find the index of `element` in `array` using the `index()` method.
3. If `element` is found in `array`, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the 0-indexed position of `element`.
4. If `element` is not found in `array`, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.
5. The function meets the problem description's requirements:
   - It returns a tuple.
   - The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether `element` is in `array`.
   - The second element of the tuple is the index position of `element` if it exists, or `-1` if it does not.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, assuming valid input, and returns the expected output according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
