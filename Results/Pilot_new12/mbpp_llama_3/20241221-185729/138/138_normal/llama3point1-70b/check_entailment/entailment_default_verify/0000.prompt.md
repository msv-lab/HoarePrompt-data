You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

This program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The `func_1` function takes an array and an element as input, and it returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. The `try` block uses the `index` method of the array to find the index of the given element.
2. If the element is found in the array, the `index` method returns the index, and the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index.
3. If the element is not found in the array, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block.
4. In the `except` block, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element is not found in the array.

This function handles all possible cases:

* If the element is in the array, it returns the correct index.
* If the element is not in the array, it returns -1 as the index.
* If the array is empty, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found, which is correctly handled by the `except` block.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array`, returning a boolean value indicating the presence of the element and its 0-indexed position if found, or -1 if not found. It handles the case where the `element` is not in the `array` by catching the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method, ensuring the function does not crash and instead returns a predictable result. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way, making it a read-only operation. The return values are a tuple containing a boolean (`True` if the element is found, `False` otherwise) and an integer (the index of the element if found, -1 if not found). The function's behavior is deterministic, meaning it will always return the same output given the same inputs, including handling edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input for either parameter, although these cases are not explicitly annotated, the function's code implies it can handle them by either returning `False` and `-1` for `None` or an empty array, or potentially throwing an exception if the inputs are not of the expected types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
