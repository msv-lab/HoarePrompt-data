You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be compared to the elements in the array for equality.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns True and the 0-indexed position of 'element' in 'array'
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns a boolean value False and an integer -1
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: array is a list of elements and element is a value compared to the elements in the array for equality. The function returns True and the 0-indexed position of 'element' in 'array' if 'element' exists in 'array', otherwise it returns False and -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array`, returning a boolean value indicating the presence of the element and its 0-indexed position if found, or -1 if not found. It handles the case where the `element` is not in the `array` by catching the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method, ensuring the function does not crash and instead returns a predictable result. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way, making it a read-only operation. The return values are a tuple containing a boolean (`True` if the element is found, `False` otherwise) and an integer (the index of the element if found, -1 if not found). The function's behavior is deterministic, meaning it will always return the same output given the same inputs, including handling edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input for either parameter, although these cases are not explicitly annotated, the function's code implies it can handle them by either returning `False` and `-1` for `None` or an empty array, or potentially throwing an exception if the inputs are not of the expected types.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
