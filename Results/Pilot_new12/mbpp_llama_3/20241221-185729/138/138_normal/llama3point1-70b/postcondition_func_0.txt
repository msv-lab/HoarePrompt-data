The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array`, returning a boolean value indicating the presence of the element and its 0-indexed position if found, or -1 if not found. It handles the case where the `element` is not in the `array` by catching the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index` method, ensuring the function does not crash and instead returns a predictable result. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way, making it a read-only operation. The return values are a tuple containing a boolean (`True` if the element is found, `False` otherwise) and an integer (the index of the element if found, -1 if not found). The function's behavior is deterministic, meaning it will always return the same output given the same inputs, including handling edge cases such as an empty input array or a `None` input for either parameter, although these cases are not explicitly annotated, the function's code implies it can handle them by either returning `False` and `-1` for `None` or an empty array, or potentially throwing an exception if the inputs are not of the expected types.
