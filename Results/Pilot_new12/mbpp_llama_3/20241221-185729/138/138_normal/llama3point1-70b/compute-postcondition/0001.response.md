The `return True, index` statement indicates that the program returns two values: a boolean value `True` and the `index` variable. 

Given the initial state, `index` is the 0-indexed position of `element` in `array` if `element` exists in `array`. 

So, the program returns `True`, which means the condition for returning `True` has been met, and `index`, which is the position of `element` in `array`.

Output State: **The program returns True and the 0-indexed position of 'element' in 'array'**
