The program could raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found in the `array`. This exception occurs at the line `index = array.index(element)`, because the `index()` method in Python raises a `ValueError` if the specified element is not found in the list.

The try-except statement accomplishes the task of checking if a given `element` exists in the `array` and returns a boolean value along with the index of the `element` if it exists. If the `element` does not exist in the `array`, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `False` along with `-1` as the index, indicating the absence of the `element`.

Therefore, the output state after the complete execution of the `try` statement is that `array` is a list of elements and `element` is a value compared to the elements in the array for equality. The function returns `True` and the 0-indexed position of `element` in `array` if `element` exists in `array`, otherwise it returns `False` and `-1`.

Output State: **array is a list of elements and element is a value compared to the elements in the array for equality. The function returns True and the 0-indexed position of 'element' in 'array' if 'element' exists in 'array', otherwise it returns False and -1.**
