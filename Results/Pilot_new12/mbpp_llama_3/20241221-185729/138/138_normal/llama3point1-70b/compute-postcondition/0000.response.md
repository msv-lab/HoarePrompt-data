The `index` variable is assigned the value of the index at which the `element` is found in the `array`. This index is the position of the `element` in the `array` where it first appears, counted from the start of the `array` (0-indexed). The states of the `array` and `element` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of elements, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements in the `array` for equality, and `index` is the 0-indexed position of `element` in `array` if `element` exists in `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements in the `array` for equality, and `index` is the 0-indexed position of `element` in `array` if `element` exists in `array`.**
