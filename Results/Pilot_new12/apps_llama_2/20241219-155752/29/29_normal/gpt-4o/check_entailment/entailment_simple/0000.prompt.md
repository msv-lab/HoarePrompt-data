You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and files is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string (the filename) and an integer (the type of the file, either 0 for a regular test or 1 for an example test), with a total length of n.
def func_1(n, files):
    examples = []
    regulars = []
    for file in files:
        name, type_ = file.split()
        
        if type_ == '1':
            examples.append(name)
        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1', `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'.
    moves = []
    temp_counter = n + 1
    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')
            examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1` and is either greater than `2 * n` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set` plus the number of times it was incremented, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves where each move is in the format 'move {original_example} {new_name}' and 'move {new_name} {1-based index}' if the original example was not equal to its 1-based index, `i` is `n - 1` if `examples` is not empty. If `examples` is empty, then the loop does not execute, and `temp_counter` remains `n + 1`, `moves` remains an empty list, and the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `regulars` is a list where each element is either its original name or updated to match the target value based on its index, `temp_counter` is greater than its initial value by the number of updates and increments, `moves` is a list of all moves made to update `regulars` to their target values, and `i` is the last index of `regulars` processed.
    return moves
    #The program returns a list of moves, where each move corresponds to an update made to the `regulars` list to match target values based on index, with the total number of updates reflected in the `temp_counter` variable being greater than its initial value by the number of updates.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
