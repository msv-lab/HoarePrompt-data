Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. 

The main issue with the program is that it doesn't handle the situation when a file needs to be moved to a location that is already occupied by another file. In this case, the program should first move the file that is currently at the target location to a temporary location, and then move the file that needs to be moved to the target location.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
3
1 1
2 1
3 0
```
The program should move the file "3" to a temporary location, then move the file "2" to location "1", then move the file "1" to location "2", and finally move the file "3" to location "3". However, the program does not do this correctly.

Another issue with the program is that it uses a temporary counter to generate temporary file names, but it does not check if the generated temporary file name is already in use. This can lead to conflicts and incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to handle the case where a file needs to be moved to a location that is already occupied by another file, and to generate temporary file names that are guaranteed to be unique. 

The program also needs to be modified to handle the case where a file is already at its target location, in which case no move operation is needed.

In conclusion, the given program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
