The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`. The new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, which is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. The string representation of `temp_counter + 1` and the string representation of `temp_counter + 2` (which is `temp_counter + 1` after incrementing `temp_counter`) are in `files_set` if `temp_counter + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer, `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1` and its string representation and the string representation of `temp_counter + 1` are in `files_set` if `temp_counter + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
