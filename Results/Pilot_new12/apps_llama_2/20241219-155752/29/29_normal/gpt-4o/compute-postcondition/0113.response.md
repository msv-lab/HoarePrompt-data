The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`regulars[i]` was equal to `str(temp_counter)`, and since `temp_counter` has been incremented, `regulars[i]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter + 1)` because `regulars[i]` is updated based on the new value of `temp_counter`. 

However, the initial state already had `moves` containing an additional string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`, so this update of `regulars[i]` doesn't change `moves`. It will still have the same string with the old value of `temp_counter` and `regulars[i]`. 

But after the increment of `temp_counter`, `regulars[i]` will be updated to `str(temp_counter + 1)` for the next iteration or usage. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, `i` retain their initial values; `moves` contains all its initial values and an additional string `'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`; `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter + 1)`**
