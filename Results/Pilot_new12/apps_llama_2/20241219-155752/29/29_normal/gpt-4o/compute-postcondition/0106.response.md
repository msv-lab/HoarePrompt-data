To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - The string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`. For the loop to execute again, the string representation of the next `temp_counter` (i.e., `temp_counter + 1`) must also be in `files_set`, or the current `temp_counter` string representation must still be in `files_set` if `temp_counter` does not change. However, since `temp_counter` is part of the condition that needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and assuming `temp_counter` will increment, we must ensure that the next value of `temp_counter` has its string representation in `files_set`. Given the original state does not explicitly define the contents of `files_set` except that it contains the string representation of `temp_counter`, we can infer that `files_set` needs to contain the string representation of the next possible `temp_counter` value for the loop to execute again.

Other states like `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, `i`, and `regulars` do not directly influence the loop condition. Hence, their states do not need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, based on the provided loop condition.

Considering these adjustments:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- The string representation of the next `temp_counter` (or the current one if it doesn't change) must be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer, `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation and the string representation of `temp_counter + 1` are in `files_set`.**
