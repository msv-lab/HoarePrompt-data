The value of `examples[i]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected, except for `examples` which now has its `i-th` element changed to `str(temp_counter)`. 

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `regulars`, and `i` retain their initial values, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or the string representation of `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`, `moves` is the updated list with an additional element 'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}', `examples` has its `i-th` element as `str(temp_counter)`**
