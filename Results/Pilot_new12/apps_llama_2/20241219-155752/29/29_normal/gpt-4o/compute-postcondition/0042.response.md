The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` may or may not be in `files_set` depending on its previous value**
