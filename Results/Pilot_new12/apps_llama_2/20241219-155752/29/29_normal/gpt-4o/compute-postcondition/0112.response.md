The code changes the value of `regulars[i]` to the string representation of `temp_counter`. The previous values of the other variables are retained. 

`temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than the largest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all integers up to `2 * n` are in `files_set`. 

`regulars[i]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter)`, which means it is equal to the string representation of the smallest integer greater than the largest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all integers up to `2 * n` are in `files_set`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than the largest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all integers up to `2 * n` are in `files_set`; `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, `i` retain their initial values; `moves` contains all its initial values and an additional string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`; `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`**
