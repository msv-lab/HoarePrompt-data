Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `moves` contains all its initial values and an additional string `'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'`, and `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter + 1)`. The values of `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
