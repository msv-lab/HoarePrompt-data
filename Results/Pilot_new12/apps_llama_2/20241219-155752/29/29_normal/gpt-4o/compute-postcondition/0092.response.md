To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement.

The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`. For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be true.

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 3` but less than or equal to `2 * n + 2`. This already satisfies the condition that `temp_counter` could be less than or equal to `2 * n`, but to ensure it can execute one more time, `temp_counter` itself doesn't need to change because its current range allows for the condition to be met if `n` is sufficiently large. However, the upper limit of `temp_counter` should be such that it can still satisfy the condition for the next iteration.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: Since `files_set` must contain the string representation of `temp_counter` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `temp_counter` (which is `temp_counter + 1`) must also be in `files_set`. 

Given that `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 3` but less than or equal to `2 * n + 2`, and considering the condition for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the next integer after `temp_counter` is also within the range that can be represented in `files_set`. This implies that `files_set` should contain strings representing integers up to at least `temp_counter + 1`.

Since `i` is 1 and does not directly influence the loop condition, and `target` is `n + 2`, which also does not directly affect the loop condition, these values do not need adjustment for the loop to execute again.

`n` being a positive integer and `files` being a list of tuples with a total length of `n` do not directly impact the loop condition either. `file` being the last file in `files`, `name` being the first part of the last file, and `type_` being the second part of the last file are specific to the loop body's operations and not the loop condition itself.

`examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, which also does not directly affect the loop condition.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the critical adjustments are related to ensuring `temp_counter` can still satisfy the loop condition, and `files_set` contains the necessary string representations to meet the loop's condition. However, given that `temp_counter`'s current range already potentially allows it to meet the condition for the next iteration if `n` is large enough, and considering `files_set` must contain the string representation of `temp_counter`, the focus should be on ensuring `files_set` can accommodate the next increment of `temp_counter`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 3` but less than or equal to `2 * n + 2`, `i` is 1, `target` is `n + 2`, and `files_set` must contain the string representation of `temp_counter` and `temp_counter + 1`.**
