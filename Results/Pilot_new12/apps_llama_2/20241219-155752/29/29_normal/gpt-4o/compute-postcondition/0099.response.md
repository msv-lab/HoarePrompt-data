Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + 2`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, indicating that `i` is 1, and from this point onwards, `temp_counter` is increased by 1, `regulars[1]` is set to `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `moves` includes an additional string 'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} {temp_counter + 1}'**
