Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'. If `examples[0]` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is a list with the first element being the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and the rest of the elements unchanged. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` is a list containing two strings: f'move {temp_counter - 1} {temp_counter - 1}' and f'move {temp_counter - 1} {1}', `i` is 0, and `temp_counter` is `min(2 * n + 1, smallest integer greater than n + 1 whose string representation is not in files_set) + 1`. Otherwise, `moves` remains an empty list, `i` is 0, and `temp_counter` is `n + 1` if `examples[0]` is equal to '1', and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.***
