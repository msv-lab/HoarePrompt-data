Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1' and must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, and `i` is 0. The current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, meaning `examples[0]` is not equal to '1'.**
