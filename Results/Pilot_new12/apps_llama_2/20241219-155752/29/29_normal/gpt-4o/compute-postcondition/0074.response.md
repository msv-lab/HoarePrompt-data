To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1.
- Other variables have specific values or relationships but are not directly relevant to the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, two conditions must be met:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: This means that after the last iteration, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` was incremented, we need to ensure that this condition can still be true.
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This means that the string representation of the new `temp_counter` value must be present in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` was incremented and is now `temp_counter + 1`, for the loop to execute again:
- The new value of `temp_counter` (which is `temp_counter + 1`) must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. This implies that `n` must be sufficiently large to allow `temp_counter + 1` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- The string representation of `temp_counter + 1` must be in `files_set`. This is already given as a condition leading to the current state, so we just need to ensure that this condition can still be met for the new value of `temp_counter`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to allow `temp_counter + 1` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, the current value of `regulars` at index `i` (which is 0) is not equal to the string representation of `target`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**.
