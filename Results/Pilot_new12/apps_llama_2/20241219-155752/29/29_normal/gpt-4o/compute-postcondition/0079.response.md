The code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', where `regulars[i]` is the current value at index `i` (which is 0) in the `regulars` list and `temp_counter` is its current value. 

The value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, which is `len(examples) + 1`. The value of `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value such that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. 

The length of `files` is `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value such that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves and now includes 'move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}', `i` is 0, `regulars[0]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.**
