To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions given in the `while` loop statement: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - Given that `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`, this condition can be satisfied if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `temp_counter` is already greater than `n + 1`, the only adjustment needed here is to ensure that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n`. However, this condition is about the relationship between `temp_counter` and `n`, and the initial state of `temp_counter` and `n` already allows for this condition to potentially be true for at least one iteration. Thus, no specific adjustment to `temp_counter` or `n` is needed based on this condition alone.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - This implies that the string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in the set `files_set`. 
   - Given that `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, and `file` is the last file in `files`, with `name` and `type_` being parts of this last file, the critical information here is the construction of `files_set` which is not directly described but implied to be related to the content of `files`.
   - To satisfy this condition, the string representation of `temp_counter` must be part of the data that contributes to `files_set`. Since `files` contains tuples and assuming `files_set` is derived from the first elements of these tuples (names), the condition suggests that at least one of the names in `files` should match the string representation of `temp_counter`. However, the description given does not directly link `files_set` to the names or any specific parts of the tuples in `files`, so we must infer based on the provided variables and their relationships.
   - The information about `regulars`, `examples`, `moves`, `i`, and `target` does not directly affect the conditions of the `while` loop but gives context to the overall program state.

Given these conditions and the initial state, for the loop to execute at least once:

- `temp_counter` needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n` which is plausible given `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1` and `n` is a positive integer.
- The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`. Without explicit information on how `files_set` is constructed from `files`, we must ensure that the content of `files` (or specifically the part of `files` that contributes to `files_set`) includes the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Since `temp_counter`'s initial state is greater than `n + 1` and `n` is positive, and there's no direct modification needed to `n` or `temp_counter` based on the provided conditions to ensure the loop can start, the focus should be on ensuring that `str(temp_counter)` could potentially be in `files_set`, which means `files` should contain data that could lead to `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n` and must contain data leading to `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1` but less than or equal to `2 * n`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, and the current value of `regulars` at index `i` (which is 0) is not equal to the string representation of `target`.**
