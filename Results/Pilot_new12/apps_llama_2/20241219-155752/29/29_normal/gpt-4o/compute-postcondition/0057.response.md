The code increments the `temp_counter` by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was strictly less than `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, which is still strictly less than `2 * n` because `temp_counter` was less than `2 * n` and incrementing it by 1 doesn't change the fact that it is less than `2 * n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1`, and `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`.**
