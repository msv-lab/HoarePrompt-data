The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was the minimum value between `2 * n + 1` and the smallest integer greater than `n + 1` whose string representation is not in `files_set`. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, 
`file` is the last file in `files`, 
`name` is the first part of the last file, 
`type_` is the second part of the last file, 
`examples` is a list with the first element being the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and the rest of the elements unchanged, 
`regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', 
`moves` is a list containing the string f'move {temp_counter - 1} {temp_counter - 1}', 
`i` is 0, 
and `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` or equal to  `min(2 * n + 1, smallest integer greater than n + 1 whose string representation is not in files_set) + 1`.
