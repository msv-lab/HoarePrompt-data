Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `moves` is updated with an additional element 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`temp_counter - 1`}', and `examples` has its `i-th` element updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)`. If `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)`, then all variables retain their initial values.***
