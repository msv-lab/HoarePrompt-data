The code `examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. 

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces, `type_` is the second part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces. 

Since the value of `examples` before the code execution is not provided, we can only determine that after the execution, `examples` will contain the value of `name` as its last element. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces, `type_` is the second part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the third file string in `files` as its last element**
