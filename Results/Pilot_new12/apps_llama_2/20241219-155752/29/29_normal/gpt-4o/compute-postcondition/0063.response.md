The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or the string representation of `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` remains a positive integer, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `regulars`, and `i` retain their initial values, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `moves` is the updated list with an additional element 'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter - 1}', `examples` has its `i-th` element as `str(temp_counter - 1)`.
