Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1` and is either greater than `2 * n` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set` plus the number of times it was incremented, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves where each move is in the format 'move {original_example} {new_name}' and 'move {new_name} {1-based index}' if the original example was not equal to its 1-based index, `i` is `n - 1` if `examples` is not empty. If `examples` is empty, then the loop does not execute, and `temp_counter` remains `n + 1`, `moves` remains an empty list, and the rest of the variables retain their initial values.**
