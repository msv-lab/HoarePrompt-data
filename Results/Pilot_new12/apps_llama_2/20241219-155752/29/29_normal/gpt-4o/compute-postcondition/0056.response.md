To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement.

The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the last file in `files`.
- `name` is the first part of the last file.
- `type_` is the second part of the last file.
- `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'.
- `i` is 2.
- `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`.
- `files_set` contains at least one string that is a representation of an integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions are still met after the previous iteration.

1. **Condition 1 (`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`):** 
   - Since `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, to guarantee it can execute one more time, we don't necessarily need to adjust `n` or `temp_counter` because the statement already allows for `temp_counter` to be up to `2 * n + 1`. However, to strictly meet the condition for the next iteration, `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n` because it will increment. Thus, the condition on `temp_counter` should be adjusted to strictly less than or equal to `2 * n` to ensure the loop can execute again without assuming an increment.

2. **Condition 2 (The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`):**
   - Since `files_set` contains at least one string that is a representation of an integer, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next value of `temp_counter` (after incrementing) is also in `files_set`. Given that `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, for it to potentially be in `files_set` after incrementing, we need `files_set` to contain the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `temp_counter` should be strictly less than or equal to `2 * n` to ensure it can execute one more time.
- The condition on `files_set` needs to be such that it includes the string representation of the next `temp_counter` value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n`, and `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`.**
