Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 1. If `examples[1]` is not equal to '2', then `examples` is a list where `examples[1]` is the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and its length is at least 2, `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n + 1` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set` plus one, and `moves` is a list with an additional element 'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
