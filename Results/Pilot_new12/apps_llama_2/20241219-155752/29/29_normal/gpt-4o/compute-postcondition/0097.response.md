The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `n + 2`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `regulars[1]` is `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `moves` includes an additional string 'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} {temp_counter + 1}'.
