The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The initial state of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. After the increment operation, `temp_counter` will be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1` if it was initially equal to `2 * n`, or still less than or equal to `2 * n` if it was less than `2 * n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer, `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1` and its string representation is in `files_set`.**
