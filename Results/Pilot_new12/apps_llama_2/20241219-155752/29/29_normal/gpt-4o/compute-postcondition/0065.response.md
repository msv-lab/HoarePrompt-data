Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3. The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, `moves` has been updated with an additional element 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`temp_counter` - 1}', and the `i-th` element of `examples` has been updated to `str(`temp_counter` - 1)`, where the previous value of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter` are the values before entering the if condition.**
