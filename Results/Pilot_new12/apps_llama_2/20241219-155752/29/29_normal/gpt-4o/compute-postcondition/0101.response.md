Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + 2`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[1]` is `str(temp_counter + 1)` and `moves` includes an additional string 'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} {n + 2}'. If `regulars[i]` equals `str(target)`, then no changes are made to the variables.***
