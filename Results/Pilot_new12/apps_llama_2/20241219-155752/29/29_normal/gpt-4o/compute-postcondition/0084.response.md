To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the last file in `files`.
- `name` is the first part of the last file.
- `type_` is the second part of the last file.
- `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index.
- `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`.
- `moves` is a list of strings representing moves.
- `i` is 0.
- `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.

And given additional conditions:
- If `regulars[0]` is not equal to `str(len(examples) + 1)`, then `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'.
- The current value of `regulars[0]` is equal to `str(temp_counter - 1)`.
- The current value of `temp_counter` is increased by 1, and `moves` includes 'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}'.
- The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`.

Now, analyzing the given code:
```python
moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
```

This code adds a new string to the `moves` list. The string represents a move from `regulars[i]` to `target`.

Given that `i` is 0 and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, the new move added to `moves` will be `f'move {regulars[0]} {len(examples) + 1}'`.

Since `regulars[0]` equals `str(temp_counter - 1)` and considering the initial conditions about `temp_counter` and its relation to `n`, the new move essentially moves `temp_counter - 1` to `len(examples) + 1`.

However, we need to remember that `temp_counter` has been increased by 1 in the precondition, which might affect the interpretation of `regulars[0]` after the increase. Yet, the code snippet provided only appends a new move to `moves` without altering `temp_counter` or `regulars` directly within its scope.

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `files` remains a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` remains the last file in `files`.
- `name` remains the first part of the last file.
- `type_` remains the second part of the last file.
- `examples` remains a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `temp_counter` remains greater than `n + 1`.
- `moves` now includes an additional move: `f'move {regulars[0]} {len(examples) + 1}'`, which translates to `f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {len(examples) + 1}'`.
- `i` remains 0.
- `target` remains `len(examples) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`, `moves` includes all previous moves and the new move `f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {len(examples) + 1}'`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.**
