Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n` that must have at least 1 file, `file` is the first file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and `regulars` is an empty list. Otherwise, `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing the value of `name`.***
