The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 3` but less than or equal to `2 * n + 2`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 4` but less than or equal to `2 * n + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 4` but less than or equal to `2 * n + 3`, `i` is 1, `target` is `n + 2`, and `files_set` must contain the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and `temp_counter`.**
