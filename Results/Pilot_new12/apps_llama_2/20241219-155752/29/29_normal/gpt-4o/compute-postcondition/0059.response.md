The code increments the `temp_counter` by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n`. After the increment, the new value of `temp_counter` will be `temp_counter + 1`, which is still strictly less than `2 * n` if `temp_counter` was less than `2 * n - 1`, but could be equal to `2 * n` if `temp_counter` was `2 * n - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n` or equal to `2 * n` if `temp_counter` was `2 * n - 1`, and `files_set` contains the string representation of the next `temp_counter` which is now `temp_counter + 1`**
