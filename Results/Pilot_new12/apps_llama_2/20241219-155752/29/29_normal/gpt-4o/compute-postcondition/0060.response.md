To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Termination Conditions**: The loop continues as long as two conditions are met:
   - `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - The string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`.

2. **Iteration Effects**: With each iteration, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.

3. **Initial State**: We're given that `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, and other variables' initial states. However, the key variable in question is `temp_counter`, which isn't directly initialized in the provided initial state. For the purpose of analyzing the loop's behavior, we'll consider its initial value as 1 or any value that satisfies the loop's conditions, given the context that `i` is 2 and `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, though these specifics don't directly affect `temp_counter`'s behavior.

4. **Loop Behavior**: The loop increments `temp_counter` until either it exceeds `2 * n` or its string representation is not found in `files_set`. 

Given these points, we can deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed:

- `temp_counter` will either be greater than `2 * n` (if the loop stops due to exceeding `2 * n`) or will be the first integer whose string representation is not in `files_set` within the range from its initial value up to `2 * n` (inclusive, if `2 * n` is within the set).

- Other variables (`n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `regulars`, `i`, `examples`) do not change their values within the loop as per the given code snippet. Therefore, their final states will be the same as their initial states.

Considering the loop condition and the increment of `temp_counter`, the final state after all iterations will depend on whether `temp_counter` reaches beyond `2 * n` or finds a missing string representation in `files_set`. However, since `temp_counter` starts at an unspecified value but is incremented with each iteration, and considering the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` for the loop to continue, we can only definitively say that `temp_counter` will be greater than its starting value and that its final value is contingent upon the contents of `files_set` and its relation to `2 * n`.

Therefore, the output state, focusing solely on variable values and their interrelations after all iterations of the while loop have executed, is:

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `regulars`, `i`, and `examples` retain their initial values, and `temp_counter` will be the smallest integer greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or the string representation of `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`.**
