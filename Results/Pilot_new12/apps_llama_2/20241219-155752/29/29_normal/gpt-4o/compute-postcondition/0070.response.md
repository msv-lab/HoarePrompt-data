To calculate the result, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code is assigning a value to the variable `target`. The value of `target` is calculated as the sum of the length of `examples`, the value of `i`, and 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`
- `file` is the last file in `files`
- `name` is the first part of the last file
- `type_` is the second part of the last file
- `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element
- `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index
- `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`
- `moves` is a list of strings representing moves
- `i` is 0

The variable `target` is assigned the value `len(examples) + i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `len(examples) + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`**
