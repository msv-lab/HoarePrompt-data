The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `files_set` contains at least one string that is a representation of an integer**
