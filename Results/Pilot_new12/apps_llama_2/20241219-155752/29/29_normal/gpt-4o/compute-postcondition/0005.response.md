The code `examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the `examples` list. 

Since `name` was the first part of `file` and `file` is the first file in the `files` list, the `name` is now appended to the `examples` list. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The `files` list remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `regulars` remains an empty list, `file` remains the first file in the `files` list, and `type_` remains '1'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n` that must have at least 1 file, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, `regulars` is an empty list, `file` is the first file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is '1'**
