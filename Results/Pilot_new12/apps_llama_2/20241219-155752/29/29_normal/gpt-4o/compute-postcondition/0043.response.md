To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` will be incremented in the next iteration (assuming the loop body increments it, though the specific operation is not provided), the condition will still hold if `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n` before the next iteration. Thus, `temp_counter` needs to be less than `2 * n` for the loop to potentially execute again.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - The loop also requires that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set` for it to execute. Since we are considering the state at the end of the previous iteration and looking forward to the next iteration, `str(temp_counter + 1)` needs to be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer, as this condition doesn't change based on the loop's execution.
- `files` remains a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, as this is not directly affected by the loop's conditions.
- `file` remains the last file in `files`, which does not directly impact the loop's condition.
- `name` and `type_` are derived from `file` and do not influence the loop's conditions directly.
- `regulars` and `examples` are not directly related to the loop's conditions.
- `i` is 1, but it does not affect the loop's conditions.
- `temp_counter` needs to be strictly less than `2 * n` for the loop to potentially execute again, considering it will be incremented.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
