To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the conditions and changes made by the loop.

The loop continues as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`.

At each iteration, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state and the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer that:
- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it's not modified within the loop.
- `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves` also remain unchanged since they are not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains 0 as it's not modified within the loop.
- The loop's primary effect is on `temp_counter`, which increments until it exceeds `2 * n` or its string representation is no longer found in `files_set`.

Considering these points, the loop will terminate when either `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or when the string representation of `temp_counter` is not found in `files_set`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be described as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the last file in `files`.
- `name` is the first part of the last file.
- `type_` is the second part of the last file.
- `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1' and must have at least 1 element.
- `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'.
- `moves` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `temp_counter` is the minimum value between `2 * n + 1` and the smallest integer greater than `n + 1` whose string representation is not in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1', `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `temp_counter` is the minimum value between `2 * n + 1` and the smallest integer greater than `n + 1` whose string representation is not in `files_set`.**
