To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given while loop condition: `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must hold true.
   - Since `n` is at least 2 and `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, the minimum value of `temp_counter` is 5. For the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` to be true, `n` must be at least 3 because if `n` were 2, `temp_counter` (5) would be greater than `2 * n` (4), violating the condition.
   - Thus, `n` must be at least 3 for this part of the condition to potentially be true.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `files_set` must contain the string representations of both `n + 2` and `n + 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `str(temp_counter)` (which is now `n + 3`) must still be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` is incrementing, the next value of `temp_counter` would be `n + 4`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to potentially execute again, `files_set` must also contain the string representation of `n + 4`.

Given these considerations:

- `n` must be at least 3 to satisfy the first condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`).
- `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 4` to satisfy the second condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`) for the next iteration.

The other states (`files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `regulars`, `moves`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop condition, so they do not need adjustments for the loop to potentially execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1' and must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of `n + 2`, `n + 3`, and `n + 4`**
