To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Given that `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, this implies `n + 2 <= 2 * n`, which simplifies to `2 <= n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 or more for this condition to potentially be true after incrementing `temp_counter`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, after incrementing `temp_counter`, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set` because `temp_counter` will be incremented before the next iteration.
   - Since `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `temp_counter + 1` will be `n + 3`. Therefore, `files_set` must also contain the string representation of `n + 3`.

Considering these conditions, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `n` must be at least 2 or more, but since `n` is already a positive integer, we ensure it meets the requirement for the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` to hold true after potential increments of `temp_counter`.
- `files_set` must contain the string representation of `n + 3`, in addition to containing the string representation of `n + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1' and must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of both `n + 2` and `n + 3`**
