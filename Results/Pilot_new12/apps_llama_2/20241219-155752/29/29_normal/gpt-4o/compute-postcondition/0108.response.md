To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue as long as two conditions are met: 

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the last file in `files`.
- `name` is the first part of the last file.
- `type_` is the second part of the last file.
- `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `target` is `n + i + 1`.
- `i` is an integer.
- `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation and the string representation of `temp_counter + 1` are in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that after the last iteration, `temp_counter` is still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and the string representation of the new `temp_counter` (after incrementing) is in `files_set`.

Since we already know that the string representation of `temp_counter` and `temp_counter + 1` are in `files_set`, and `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, no additional adjustments are needed to these conditions to ensure the loop can run one more time, assuming the loop body doesn't alter these conditions in a way that would prevent another iteration.

However, it's crucial to note that for the loop to execute again, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` must still be true after the last iteration, and since `temp_counter`'s string representation and `temp_counter + 1`'s string representation are in `files_set`, we don't need to adjust `files_set` or `temp_counter`'s relationship with `2 * n` because these conditions are already met.

Therefore, the states do not need adjustments beyond what is already given, as the conditions for the loop to execute again are inherently met by the provided state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer, `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation and the string representation of `temp_counter + 1` are in `files_set`**
