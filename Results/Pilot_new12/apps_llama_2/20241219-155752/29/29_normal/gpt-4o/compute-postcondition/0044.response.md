The code increments `temp_counter` by 1, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n` and is equal to `temp_counter + 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set` was true before so now `str(temp_counter + 2)` should be in `files_set` to maintain the condition that was true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n` and equals to `temp_counter + 1`, and `str(temp_counter + 2)` is in `files_set`**
