The given code is appending a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'. 

Given that `i` is 0 and `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, we know that `examples[0]` is not equal to '1'. 

So, `examples` is a list with the first element being the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and the rest of the elements unchanged. 

The `moves` list initially contains the string f'move {temp_counter - 1} {temp_counter - 1}'.

After appending the new string to `moves`, it will contain two strings: f'move {temp_counter - 1} {temp_counter - 1}' and f'move {examples[0]} {1}'.

Since `examples[0]` is the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`, the new string is equivalent to f'move {temp_counter - 1} {1}'.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with the first element being the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and the rest of the elements unchanged, `moves` is a list containing two strings: f'move {temp_counter - 1} {temp_counter - 1}' and f'move {temp_counter - 1} {1}', `i` is 0, and `temp_counter` is `min(2 * n + 1, smallest integer greater than n + 1 whose string representation is not in files_set) + 1**
