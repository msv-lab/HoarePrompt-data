The code appends a string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}', where `examples[i]` is the name at index `i` in the `examples` list and `temp_counter` is the minimum value between `2 * n + 1` and the smallest integer greater than `n + 1` whose string representation is not in `files_set`. 

Since `i` is 0, `examples[i]` is the first element in the `examples` list. The value of `temp_counter` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1', `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is a list containing the string 'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter}', `i` is 0, and `temp_counter` is the minimum value between `2 * n + 1` and the smallest integer greater than `n + 1` whose string representation is not in `files_set`.
