The code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {regulars[i]} {target}'. 

`regulars[i]` is the current value of `regulars[i]`, and `target` is `n + i + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `moves` now contains all its initial values and an additional string 'move {regulars[i]} {n + i + 1}'.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, 
`file` is the last file in `files`, 
`name` is the first part of the last file, 
`type_` is the second part of the last file, 
`examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, 
`target` is `n + i + 1`, 
`i` is an integer, 
`regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, 
`moves` contains all its initial values and an additional string 'move {regulars[i]} {n + i + 1}'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer, `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, `moves` contains all its initial values and an additional string 'move {regulars[i]} {n + i + 1}'**
