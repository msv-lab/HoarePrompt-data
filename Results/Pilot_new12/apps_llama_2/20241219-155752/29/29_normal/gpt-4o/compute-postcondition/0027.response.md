The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was `n + 2`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `n + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1' and must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of both `n + 2` and `n + 3`**
