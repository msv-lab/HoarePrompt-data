The code `regulars.append(name)` appends the `name` to the `regulars` list. The value of `name` is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces, and `file` is the third file in the `files` list. 

The states of `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, and `type_` are not affected. 

However, we must note that `regulars` was not defined in the initial state. Therefore, in the output state, we should mention that `regulars` is a list containing the `name` which is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces.

Also, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, so `file` is `files[2]`. 

The value of `name` is `file.split()[0]`, and `type_` is `file.split()[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the third file in the `files` list (`files[2]`), `name` is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces (`file.split()[0]`), `type_` is the second part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces (`file.split()[1]`), and `regulars` is a list containing `name` (`file.split()[0]`).**
