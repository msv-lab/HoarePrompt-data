To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the second file in the `files` list.
- `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`.
- `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`.
- The contents of `examples` and `regulars` depend on the value of `type_`.

The loop statement is `for file in files:`. This means that in each iteration, `file` takes the value of the next tuple in the `files` list.

Since `file` is currently the second file in the list, for the loop to execute again, `file` must become the third file in the list. This implies that `files` must have at least 3 elements (since `n` is greater than 1 and we've already iterated over the first two elements), and thus `n` must be at least 3.

Additionally, `name` will become the first part of the third file, and `type_` will become the second part of the third file in `files`.

The contents of `examples` and `regulars` will depend on the new value of `type_` (the second part of the third file), but we cannot determine their exact contents without knowing this value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the third file in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the third file in `files`**.
