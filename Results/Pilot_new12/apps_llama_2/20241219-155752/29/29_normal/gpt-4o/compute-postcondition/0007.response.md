The value of `name` is appended to the `regulars` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. The `regulars` list is now a list containing the first part of the first file in the `files` list. The length of `regulars` is now 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n` that must have at least 1 file, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing the value of `name`, `file` is the first file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`, and `type_` is not equal to '1'**
