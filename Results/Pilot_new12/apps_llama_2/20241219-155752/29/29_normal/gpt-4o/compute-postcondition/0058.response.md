To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to examine the conditions of the `while` loop statement: `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. The first condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. However, we are given that `temp_counter` equals `temp_counter + 1`, which suggests an inconsistency or a need for clarification in the problem statement as provided. Normally, this would imply `temp_counter` is not actually changing, but given the context, it seems there might be an intention to convey that `temp_counter` is being incremented but the statement is awkwardly phrased. Assuming the intent was to show `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n` and will be incremented, we focus on ensuring `temp_counter` remains within this bound for the next iteration.

2. The second condition is `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. For the loop to execute again, the string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`. Since `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` needs to be such that its string representation is in `files_set` for the next iteration. Given that `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`, we can infer that for the next iteration, `temp_counter + 1` (which becomes the new `temp_counter` after increment) should have its string representation in `files_set`.

Given these conditions, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `temp_counter` should be less than `2 * n` to satisfy the first condition. Since we are given `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n`, this condition is met.
- `files_set` should contain the string representation of the next `temp_counter`. Since `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`, this condition is met for the next iteration if we consider `temp_counter + 1` as the new value of `temp_counter` for the next iteration.

Therefore, considering the provided conditions and the intent to enable another iteration of the loop, the states do not necessarily need adjustments in terms of new values but rather an understanding that `temp_counter` will increment and `files_set` will need to reflect the new `temp_counter` value for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, `temp_counter` is strictly less than `2 * n` and will be incremented for the next iteration, and `files_set` contains the string representation of the next `temp_counter`**
