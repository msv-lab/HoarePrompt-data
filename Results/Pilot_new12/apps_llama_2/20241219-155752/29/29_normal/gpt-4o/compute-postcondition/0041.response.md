To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **`temp_counter` Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, which means it could be equal to `2 * n + 1` or less. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must not exceed `2 * n`.

2. **`str(temp_counter) in files_set` Condition**: For the loop to continue, the string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set`. Since at the end of the previous iteration, `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`, it implies that `temp_counter` itself does not necessarily have to be adjusted regarding its presence in `files_set`, but we do need to ensure that the next `temp_counter` (after increment) is in `files_set`.

Given these conditions, here's how the states should be adjusted:

- `n` remains a positive integer, as its value does not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given conditions.
- `files`, `file`, `name`, and `type_` do not directly affect the loop condition.
- `regulars` and `examples` do not influence the loop condition directly.
- `i` is 1, which does not impact the loop condition.
- `temp_counter` must be such that after an increment, it is still less than or equal to `2 * n` and its string representation is in `files_set`. Given `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n` so that after an increment, it is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` being in `files_set` implies we're good on that front.
- Since `temp_counter` needs to be less than `2 * n` to satisfy both conditions after an increment (and considering it must be an integer), and we know `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`, which already accounts for the presence condition for the next iteration, we don't need to adjust `n` or the presence condition but ensure `temp_counter` is positioned to meet the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
