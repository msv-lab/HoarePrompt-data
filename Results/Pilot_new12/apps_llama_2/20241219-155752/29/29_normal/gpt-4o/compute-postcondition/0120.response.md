The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `files`. `n` is a positive integer, and `files` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string (the filename) and an integer (the type of the file, either 0 for a regular test or 1 for an example test), with a total length of `n`. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of moves, where each move corresponds to an update made to match target values based on index. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `files` of length `n`, and returns a list of moves corresponding to updates made to match target values based on index.**
