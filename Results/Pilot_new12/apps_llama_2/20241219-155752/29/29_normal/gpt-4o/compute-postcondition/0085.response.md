Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`. If `regulars[0]` is not equal to `str(len(examples) + 1)`, then `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and `regulars[0]` is equal to `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1, and `moves` includes 'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {temp_counter - 1}'. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` includes all previous moves and the new move `f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {len(examples) + 1}'`.***
