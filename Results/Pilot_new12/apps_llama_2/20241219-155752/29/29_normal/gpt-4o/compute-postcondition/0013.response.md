Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and twice the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file. If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file, the first part of the second file, and `name`.**
