The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to allow `temp_counter + 2` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, the current value of `regulars` at index `i` (which is 0) is not equal to the string representation of `target`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set` but now `str(temp_counter + 2)` must be in `files_set` because `temp_counter` is increased by one and the `str(temp_counter + 1)` is now `str(temp_counter + 2)` in the new state.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to allow `temp_counter + 2` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and must have at least 1 element, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n` where the original values of `examples` were not equal to their respective 1-based index, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `moves` is a list of strings representing moves, `i` is 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, the current value of `regulars` at index `i` (which is 0) is not equal to the string representation of `target`, and `str(temp_counter + 2)` must be in `files_set`.**
