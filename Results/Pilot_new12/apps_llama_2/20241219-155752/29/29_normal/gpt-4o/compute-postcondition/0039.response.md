To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition in the `while` loop statement.

The condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`. For the loop to execute at least once, this condition must be true.

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: This part of the condition requires that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `2 * n` will also be a positive integer. The state of `n` being a positive integer is sufficient for this part of the condition to potentially be true, given an appropriate value of `temp_counter`.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This part of the condition requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` is in the set `files_set`. However, the initial state does not explicitly define `temp_counter` or `files_set`. We can infer that for this condition to be true, `files_set` must contain the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Given the states:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`,
- `file` is the last file in `files`,
- `name` is the first part of the last file,
- `type_` is the second part of the last file,
- `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1',
- `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2,
- `i` is 1,

And considering the condition of the `while` loop, we need to adjust the states so that `temp_counter` is defined and is such that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, and `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

The states provided do not directly influence the condition of the `while` loop except for `n`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to define `temp_counter` and ensure `files_set` contains `str(temp_counter)`. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information about `temp_counter` and `files_set` initially. 

Thus, we infer that for the loop to execute, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. The states of other variables do not directly impact the loop's condition except that `n` being a positive integer is a prerequisite for the potential truth of the first part of the condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
