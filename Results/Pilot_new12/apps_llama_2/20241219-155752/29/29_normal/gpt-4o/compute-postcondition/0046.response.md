The code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format 'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}', where `examples[i]` is the element at index `i` in the `examples` list and `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set`. Since `i` is 1, `examples[i]` is the second element in the `examples` list. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set`, and `moves` is a list with an additional element 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'**
