The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `n + 3`. Therefore, the new value of `temp_counter` is `(n + 3) + 1`, which is `n + 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1' and must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 4`, `i` is 0, and `files_set` must contain the string representations of `n + 2`, `n + 3`, and `n + 4`**
