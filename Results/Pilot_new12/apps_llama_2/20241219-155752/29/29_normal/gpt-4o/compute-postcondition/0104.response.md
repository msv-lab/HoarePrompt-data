To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop statement.

The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the last file in `files`.
- `name` is the first part of the last file.
- `type_` is the second part of the last file.
- `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `target` is `n + i + 1`.
- `i` is an integer.
- `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed.

And the loop condition involves `temp_counter` and `files_set`, which are not explicitly defined in the given state. However, we can infer that for the loop to execute, `temp_counter` needs to be within the range defined by `2 * n`, and `files_set` needs to contain the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Since `files` is a list of tuples and its length is `n`, and assuming `files_set` is derived from `files` (though the exact derivation is not specified), we need to ensure that the string representation of at least one `temp_counter` value is present in `files_set`. Given that `examples` contains string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, it's plausible that `files_set` could be related to these examples, but without explicit information on how `files_set` is constructed, we focus on the conditions given.

For the loop to certainly execute one time, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is within the specified range and that its string representation is in `files_set`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `2 * n` will also be positive, providing a range for `temp_counter`. However, without knowing the initial value of `temp_counter`, we must consider the condition that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `temp_counter` and its relation to `files_set` are crucial, and assuming `files_set` could potentially contain string representations of integers up to `n` (based on the `examples` list), we adjust our focus to the fact that `temp_counter` should be such that its string representation could plausibly be in `files_set`, and it must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

Therefore, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time would involve ensuring that:
- `temp_counter` is initialized to a value that is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- The string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`.

Since the problem does not specify how `files_set` is generated from `files` or other variables, and assuming `temp_counter` starts at a value that could reasonably allow the loop to execute (e.g., 1), the critical adjustment is ensuring that `temp_counter`'s string representation is in `files_set`, which implies that `files_set` must contain at least one string representation of an integer that `temp_counter` could be.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `target` is `n + i + 1`, `i` is an integer, `regulars` must have at least one more element than previously processed, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` with its string representation in `files_set`.**
