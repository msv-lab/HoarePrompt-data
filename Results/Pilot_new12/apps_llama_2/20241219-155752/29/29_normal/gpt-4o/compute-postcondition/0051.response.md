The given code appends a new string to the `moves` list. This string is in the format 'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}', where `examples[i]` is the string at index `i` in the `examples` list and `i + 1` is the current value of `i` plus one. 

The value of `i` is 1 and the value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The length of `files` is `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'. 

If `examples[1]` is not equal to '2', then `examples` is a list where `examples[1]` is the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and its length is at least 2, `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n + 1` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set` plus one.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 1, `moves` is a list with an additional element 'move {examples[1]} {2}', if `examples[1]` is not equal to '2', then `examples` is a list where `examples[1]` is the string representation of `temp_counter - 1` and its length is at least 2, `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n + 1` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set` plus one**
