`moves` is updated with an additional element 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`i + 1`}'. The previous value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, and `i` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, `moves` has been updated with an additional element 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`i + 1`}' and also has the element 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`temp_counter` - 1}', and the `i-th` element of `examples` has been updated to `str(`temp_counter` - 1)`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `i` is 2, `examples` is a list with a length of at least 3 and `examples[i]` equals `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, `moves` has been updated with elements 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`temp_counter` - 1}' and 'move {previous value of `examples[i]`} {`i + 1`}'**
