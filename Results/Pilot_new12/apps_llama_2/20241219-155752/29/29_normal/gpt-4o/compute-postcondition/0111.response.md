To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program state.

The code appends a new string to the `moves` list. The string is in the format `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`, where `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter` are the values to be appended.

Given the initial state:
- `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than the largest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all integers up to `2 * n` are in `files_set`.
- `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, `i`, and `regulars` retain their initial values or states as they are not modified within the loop.

After executing the code:
- `moves` now contains an additional string in the format `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.
- The values of `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, `i`, `regulars`, and `temp_counter` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
- The length of the `moves` list is increased by 1.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than the largest integer whose string representation is in `files_set` and less than or equal to `2 * n`, or `2 * n + 1` if all integers up to `2 * n` are in `files_set`; `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `target`, `i`, and `regulars` retain their initial values; `moves` contains all its initial values and an additional string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
