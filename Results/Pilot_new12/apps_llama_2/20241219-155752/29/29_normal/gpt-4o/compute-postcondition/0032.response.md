The code `examples[i] = str(temp_counter)` updates the value of `examples` at index `i`, which is 0, with the string representation of `temp_counter`. The previous value of `examples` at index 0 is replaced with this new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list with the first element being the string representation of `temp_counter` and the rest of the elements unchanged, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is a list containing the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter}', `i` is 0, and `temp_counter` is the minimum value between `2 * n + 1` and the smallest integer greater than `n + 1` whose string representation is not in `files_set`.**
