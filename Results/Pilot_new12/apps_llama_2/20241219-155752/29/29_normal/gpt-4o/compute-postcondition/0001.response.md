The code initializes a new empty list `regulars`. The initial state's variables `n`, `files`, and `examples` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `examples` is an empty list, and `regulars` is an empty list**
