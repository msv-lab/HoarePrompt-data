The value of `regulars[i]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. Given that `i` is 1, `regulars[1]` is assigned the value `str(temp_counter)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `n + 2`, `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or the string representation of `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`, `regulars[1]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional string 'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'**
