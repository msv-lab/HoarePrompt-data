According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `files` list. If the list has at least 2 files, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `files` has at least 1 file, `file` is the first file in the list, `name` is the first part of `file`, and `type_` is the second part of `file`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `files` must have at least 2 files. If `files` has at least 2 files, then `file` will be the second file in the list. Let's denote the first part of the second file as `new_name` and the second part as `new_type_`. 

If `new_type_` is '1', then `examples` will contain the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` will be a list containing the value of `name`. Otherwise, `examples` will contain the first part of the first file in `files`, and `regulars` will be a list containing the values of `name` and `new_name`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n` that must have at least 2 files, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file. Otherwise, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file.**
