The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`. 

So the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, which is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set` if `temp_counter + 1` was in `files_set` before the increment and the string representation is still the same. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`, and `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`**
