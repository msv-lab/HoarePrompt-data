According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `regulars` list and the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `regulars` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1 to 1. The `regulars` list must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of string representations of integers from 1 to `n`, `temp_counter` is greater than `n + 1`, `i` is 1, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1**, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1' and `regulars` must have at least 2 elements**.
