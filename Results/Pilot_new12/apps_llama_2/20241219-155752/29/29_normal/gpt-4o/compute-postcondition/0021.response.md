The value of `temp_counter` is assigned `n + 1`. The previous values of `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves` are not affected. 
The value of `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1', `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is `n + 1`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1', `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `examples` is a list of names from files where `type_` was '1', `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `moves` is an empty list, and `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.**
