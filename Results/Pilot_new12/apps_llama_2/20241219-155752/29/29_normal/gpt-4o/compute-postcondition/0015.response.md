The code splits the `file` variable into two parts using the `split` method, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. Since `name` and `type_` are assigned the result of `file.split()`, they become the first and second parts of the `file` string, respectively. 

Given that `file` is the third file in the `files` list, we don't have its exact value, but we know it is the third element of `files`, i.e., `files[2]`.

The states of `n`, `files`, and the fact that `file` is the third file in `files` are not affected by the code. Only `name` and `type_` are updated based on the `file` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces, `type_` is the second part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces**
