To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
   - `file` is the second file in the `files` list.
   - `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`.
   - `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`.
   - If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file. 
   - Otherwise, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file.

2. **Given Code**: 
   - `regulars.append(name)`

This code appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`.

Given the initial conditions and the code:
- If `type_` is '1', then initially `regulars` contains the first part of the first file, and `examples` contains the first parts of both the first and second files. After executing the code, `regulars` will contain the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file (`name`).
- If `type_` is not '1', then initially `regulars` contains the first parts of both the first and second files, and `examples` contains only the first part of the first file. After executing the code, `regulars` will contain the first part of the first file and twice the first part of the second file (`name`).

Thus, the output state reflects the changes made to `regulars` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file and `name`, otherwise, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file, the first part of the second file, and `name`.**
