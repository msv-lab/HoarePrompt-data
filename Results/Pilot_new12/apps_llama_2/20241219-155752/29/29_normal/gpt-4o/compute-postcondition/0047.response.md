The value of `examples[i]` becomes the string representation of `temp_counter`. Since `i` is 1, `examples[1]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list where `examples[1]` is the string representation of `temp_counter` and its length is at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set`, and `moves` is a list with an additional element 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}' which is now 'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list where `examples[1]` is the string representation of `temp_counter` and its length is at least 2, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is either greater than `2 * n` or the smallest integer whose string representation is not in `files_set`, and `moves` is a list with an additional element 'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'**
