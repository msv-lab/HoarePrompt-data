To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for i in range(len(examples)):`. This indicates that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `examples`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the last file in `files`.
- `name` is the first part of the last file.
- `type_` is the second part of the last file.
- `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1'.
- Conditions regarding `examples`, `moves`, `i`, and `temp_counter` are provided, but the crucial factor for the loop's continuation is the value of `i` relative to the length of `examples`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `examples`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 (since it's currently 0), making it 1.

The length of `examples` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again, because `i` needs to be less than the length of `examples` for the loop to continue.

The states of `n`, `files`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `regulars`, `moves`, and `temp_counter` do not directly influence the loop's ability to execute again, as determined by the loop statement itself. However, the conditions related to `examples` imply that its length and contents could affect the loop's behavior indirectly through the loop body (which is not shown).

Therefore, focusing strictly on the loop statement and the conditions given:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the last file in `files`, `name` is the first part of the last file, `type_` is the second part of the last file, `regulars` is a list of names from files where `type_` was not '1', `examples` is a list with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1**
