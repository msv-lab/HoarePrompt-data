The code initializes an empty list called `examples`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `files`. 

The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and the value of `files` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string (the filename) and an integer (the type of the file, either 0 for a regular test or 1 for an example test), with a total length of `n`. 

An empty list `examples` is created.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, and `examples` is an empty list**
