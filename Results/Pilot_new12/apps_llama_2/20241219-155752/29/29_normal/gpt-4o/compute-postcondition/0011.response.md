To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

1. `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
2. `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
3. `file` is the second file in the `files` list.
4. `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`.
5. `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`.
6. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file. Otherwise, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file.

The code provided is:
```python
examples.append(name)
```
This code appends the value of `name` to the `examples` list.

Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1.
- The `files` list and its contents, including `file`, remain unchanged.
- The values of `name` and `type_` remain unchanged.
- The `examples` list is updated by appending `name` to it. Initially, if `type_` was '1', `examples` contained the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file. After appending `name` (which is the first part of the second file), `examples` will contain the first part of the first file and twice the first part of the second file. If `type_` was not '1', `examples` initially contained only the first part of the first file. After appending `name`, it will contain the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file.
- The `regulars` list remains unchanged as per the given code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`.
- `file` is the second file in the `files` list.
- `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`.
- `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`.
- If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files`, and twice the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file. Otherwise, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second file in `files`, `type_` is the second part of the second file in `files`, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and twice the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the value of the first part of the first file, otherwise, `examples` is a list containing the first part of the first file in `files` and the first part of the second file in `files`, and `regulars` is a list containing the values of the first part of the first file and the first part of the second file**
