Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `files` is a list of tuples with a total length of `n`, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces, `type_` is the second part of the `file` string after splitting by spaces. If `type_` equals '1', `examples` is a list containing the first part of the third file string in `files` as its last element. Otherwise, `regulars` is a list containing `name` (`file.split()[0]`).***
