The code prints the value of `line`. The value of `line` is the third line in the `script`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The `print` function does not change the state of the variables but outputs the value of `line` to the console.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 lines, `line` is the third line in the `script`, and the third line in `script` has been printed**
