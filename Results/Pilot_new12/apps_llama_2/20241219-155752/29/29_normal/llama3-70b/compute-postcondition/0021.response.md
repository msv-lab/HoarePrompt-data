The given Python code appends a new string to the `script` list. The string is `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `file` is the third filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 3. 

The `script` list initially contains two strings: the original string and `f'move {file} {i}'`. After executing the code, it will contain three strings: the original string, `f'move {file} {i}'`, and another string `f'move {file} {i}'`. 

Since `file` is the third filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 3, the new string appended to the `script` list is the same as the second string in the `script` list. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 with at least 3 filenames, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing three strings, the first string is the original string, the second and third strings are `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the third filename in `examples` and `i` is 3, `i` is 3, `file` is the third filename in the `examples` list**
