The code snippet `files.append((name, int(type_)))` adds a new tuple to the list `files`. 

The tuple contains the `name` and the integer conversion of `type_`. The integer conversion of `type_` will result in either 0 or 1, since `types` are either 0 or 1. 

So, the list `files` now contains one more tuple, which is `(name, int(type_))`, in addition to the tuples it already had. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuples `(name, int(type_))` including the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string**
