The value of `script` is updated by appending a new string in the format 'move {filename} {index}' where the filename is the first filename in the `regular` list and the index is `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`script` now includes all the filenames from `examples` (if `examples` is not empty) and the first filename from the `regular` list. 

The value of `i` is still `len(examples) + 1`, and the value of `file` is still the first filename in the `regular` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples where at least one tuple has type 0, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0 and must have at least 1 filename, `script` is a list of strings in the format 'move {filename} {index}' for each filename in `examples` and 'move {file} {i}', `i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `file` is the first filename in the `regular` list**
