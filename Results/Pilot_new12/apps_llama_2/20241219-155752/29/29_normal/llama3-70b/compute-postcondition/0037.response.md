To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code simply prints each line in the `script` list. The output state after the loop executes some number of times indicates that the `script` list must have at least that number of lines for the loop to execute that many times. The variable `line` takes the value of the current line being printed in each iteration.

Given that the length of `script` has been printed as `len(examples) + len(regular)`, we know that the total number of iterations of the loop will be equal to the total number of lines in `script`, which is the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`.

After the loop finishes executing, the following will be true:
- `n` will still be a positive integer, as the loop does not modify `n`.
- `files` will remain a sorted list of `n` tuples, unchanged by the loop.
- `examples` will still be a list of filenames of type 1, unchanged.
- `regular` will still be a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, unchanged.
- `script` will be the same list of strings, but all its lines would have been printed.
- `line` will be the last line in the `script` after the loop finishes, because in the last iteration of the loop, `line` takes the value of the last line in `script`.

The loop does not have any conditions under which it wouldn't execute at all based on the information given (like an empty `script` list), but if `script` were empty (which would only happen if both `examples` and `regular` were empty), the loop would not execute, and the values of all variables would remain as in the initial state.

However, given the initial state's conditions and the fact that `n` is a positive integer and `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, it's reasonable to infer that `examples` and/or `regular` would have elements (since `files` has `n` tuples and `n` is positive), thus `script` would not be empty under the given initial conditions.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is an empty list or a list of strings where all lines have been printed, `line` is the last line in the `script` or undefined if `script` was empty.**
