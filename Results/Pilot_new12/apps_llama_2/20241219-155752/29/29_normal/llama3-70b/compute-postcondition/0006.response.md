The code `name, type_ = input().split()` assigns the input string split into two parts to the variables `name` and `type_`. 

`name` is assigned the first part of the input string and `type_` is assigned the second part of the input string. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`n` is at least 2, 
`filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, 
`types` are either 0 or 1, 
`files` is a list containing the tuple `(name, int(type_))`, 
`name` is the first part of the input string, 
`type_` is the second part of the input string.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string**
