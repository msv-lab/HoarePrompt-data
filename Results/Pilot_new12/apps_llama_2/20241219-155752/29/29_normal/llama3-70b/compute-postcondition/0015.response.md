The code snippet `script = []` initializes a new empty list `script`. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular`. 

The initial state's conditions regarding the types and relationships of the variables are still valid after executing this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type, sorted in descending order by type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 from the `files` list, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is an empty list**
