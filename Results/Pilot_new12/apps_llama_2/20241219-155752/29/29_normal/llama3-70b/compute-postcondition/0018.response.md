To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 that must have at least 1 filename.
- `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0.
- `script` is a list containing one string 'move {first filename in examples} 1'.
- `i` is 1.
- `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list.

The loop statement is:
```
for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
```

For the loop to execute one more time, it means the current iteration has just finished, and we are moving to the next iteration. 

Given that `i` is 1 and `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list, for the next iteration to happen:
1. `i` needs to increment by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
2. Since `i` represents the index in the `examples` list plus 1 (due to `start=1` in `enumerate`), the list `examples` must have at least 2 filenames for the loop to execute again. This is because the `enumerate` function will attempt to access the next element in the list, which requires the list to have more than one element.
3. `file` needs to be updated to the second filename in the `examples` list because the loop iteration advances to the next item in the `examples` list.

The states of `n`, `files`, `regular`, and `script` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute one more time, as the loop's continuation is determined solely by the `examples` list having more elements and the current index `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop directly.
- `files` remains unchanged.
- `examples` must have at least 2 filenames.
- `regular` remains unchanged.
- `script`'s state is not directly affected by the loop's iteration, but since it contains a command referencing the first filename in `examples`, and now `file` will be the second filename, this might imply an update in the `script` if it's supposed to reflect the current `file`. However, based on the given loop statement, `script`'s update is not directly related to the loop's logic provided here.
- `i` becomes 2.
- `file` becomes the second filename in the `examples` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 that must have at least 2 filenames, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing one string (its exact update depends on external logic not provided), `i` is 2, `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list**
