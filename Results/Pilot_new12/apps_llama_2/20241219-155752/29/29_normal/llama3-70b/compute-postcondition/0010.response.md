To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of the given code on the program.

The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` adds a new tuple to the end of the `files` list. This tuple contains two elements: `name` and the integer conversion of `type_`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters.
- `types` are either 0 or 1.
- `files` is a list containing the tuples `(name, int(type_))`.
- `name` is the input string's first part.
- `type_` is the second part of the input string expected to be "0" or "1".

The code does not change the values of `n`, `filenames`, or `types`, but it does modify the `files` list by appending a new tuple to it. The new tuple's first element is `name`, and its second element is `int(type_)`, which is either 0 or 1, corresponding to the `types` description.

Therefore, after executing the code, the `files` list will contain an additional tuple `(name, int(type_))`, where `name` is a string (part of the input) and `int(type_)` is either 0 or 1, based on the input's second part.

The output state is: 
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters.
- `types` are either 0 or 1.
- `files` is a list containing the tuples `(name, int(type_))`, with an additional tuple `(name, int(type_))` appended to it, where `name` is the current input string's first part and `int(type_)` is the integer conversion of the input string's second part, which is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))` with an additional tuple `(name, int(type_))` appended, where `name` is the input string's first part and `int(type_)` is either 0 or 1**
