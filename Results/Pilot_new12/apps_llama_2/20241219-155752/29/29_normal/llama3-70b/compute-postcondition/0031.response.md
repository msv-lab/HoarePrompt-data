According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. If the `script` has at least 1 line, the loop can execute. Given that the length of `script` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`, it implies that `script` is not empty since `n` is a positive integer and `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples. For the loop to execute, `line` must be the first line in the `script`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 line, line is the first line in the `script`**
