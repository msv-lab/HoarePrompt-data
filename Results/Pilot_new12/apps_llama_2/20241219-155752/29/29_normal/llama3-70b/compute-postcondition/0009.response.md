The code `name, type_ = input().split()` assigns the first part of the input string to `name` and the second part to `type_`. The previous values of `name` and `type_` are replaced with these new values.

Given that `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and `types` are either 0 or 1, the new values of `name` and `type_` must adhere to these constraints if they are to be considered valid and added to `files`.

The input string is split into two parts, so `name` will be a string (could be digits and/or small English letters, but its length is determined by the input), and `type_` (before conversion) will be a string. 

However, considering the overall context and the mention of `int(type_)` in the initial state description, it's logical to infer that `type_` is expected to be a string that can be converted to an integer (either "0" or "1"), adhering to the `types` constraint.

The state of other variables (`n`, `filenames`, `types`, `files`) is not directly affected by this code snippet, assuming `files` is not modified within this specific snippet but is mentioned as containing tuples including the newly added one which is a separate operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuples `(name, int(type_))` including the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string which should be either "0" or "1" to align with the `types` definition.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuples `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the input string's first part, `type_` is the second part of the input string expected to be "0" or "1".**
