The code creates a new list called `examples` which includes the filenames from the `files` list where the type is 1. The value of `n` and the `files` list remain unchanged, but a new variable `examples` is introduced. 

The `files` list is still a sorted list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type, sorted in descending order by type. The `n` is still a positive integer.

The `examples` list contains filenames ( strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) of type 1 from the `files` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type, sorted in descending order by type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 from the `files` list**
