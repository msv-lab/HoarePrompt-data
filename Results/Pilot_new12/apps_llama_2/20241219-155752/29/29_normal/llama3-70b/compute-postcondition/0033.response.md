According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. If the `script` has at least 2 lines, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `script` has at least 1 line, `line` is the first line in the `script`, and the first line in the `script` has been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `script` must have at least 2 lines and `line` is the second line in the `script`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 lines, `line` is the second line in the `script`**
