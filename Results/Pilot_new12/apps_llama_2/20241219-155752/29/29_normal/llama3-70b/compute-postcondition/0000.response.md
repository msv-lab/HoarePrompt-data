The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, the input is a positive integer. Therefore, the value of `n` is a positive integer.

The states of the other variables (filenames and types) are not affected, but their values are not yet assigned because the code only reads the value of `n` and does not process the subsequent lines of input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, filenames are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, types are either 0 or 1 for each filename, but filenames and types are not yet assigned.**
