According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, this condition is already met. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan on using later, so we don't need to adjust its state. 

The state of `filenames`, `types`, and `files` does not affect the execution of the loop, as the loop only depends on `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is an empty list**
