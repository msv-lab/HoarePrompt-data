To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters.
- `types` are either 0 or 1.
- `files` is a list containing the tuple `(name, int(type_))`, where `name` is a string and `type_` is either '0' or '1'.
- The loop is `for _ in range(n):`, which means it will iterate `n` times.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that the loop has executed at least once. Since the loop counter is not explicitly mentioned (because it's `_`), we don't directly increment a specific variable like `i` or `index` as in the examples. However, we can infer the condition for the loop to execute again based on the range.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The condition is simply that the current iteration count must be less than `n`.
- Since the loop has already executed once (at the end of the previous iteration), for it to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 or more because one iteration has already completed.

Therefore, considering the loop `for _ in range(n):`, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` must be at least 2 (since one iteration has passed).
- Other variables (`filenames`, `types`, `files`, `name`, `type_`) do not directly influence the loop's execution condition based on the provided loop statement. Their states or values do not need adjustment based solely on the loop statement provided.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is a string, and `type_` is either '0' or '1'**
