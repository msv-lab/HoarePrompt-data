To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information step by step, focusing on the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters.
   - `types` are either 0 or 1 for each filename, but not yet assigned.
   - `files` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```
   for _ in range(n):
       name, type_ = input().split()
       files.append((name, int(type_)))
   ```
   The loop iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it takes a string input, splits it into two parts (`name` and `type_`), converts `type_` to an integer, and appends a tuple of `(name, int(type_))` to the `files` list.

3. **Output States for First Few Iterations**:
   - After 1 iteration: `files` contains one tuple, `n` is at least 1.
   - After 2 iterations: `files` contains two tuples, `n` is at least 2.
   - After 3 iterations: `files` contains three tuples, `n` is at least 3.

From these observations and the loop code, we can infer the following about the output state after all iterations have finished:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations.
- `filenames` (or `name` in each iteration) are distinct and follow the specified format, but their final state is accumulated in the `files` list.
- `types` are either 0 or 1 and are converted to integers, also accumulated in the `files` list.
- `files` is a list that will contain `n` tuples, each tuple being a pair of a filename and its type (as an integer).

If the loop does not execute (which cannot happen given `n` is a positive integer), the state of the variables would be the initial state, with `files` remaining an empty list.

Therefore, considering all iterations have finished and taking into account the initial state and the changes made by the loop:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (an integer, either 0 or 1), and the original `filenames` and `types` are accumulated as pairs in the `files` list.**
