The code appends a new string to the `script` list. The new string is a formatted string that includes the value of `file` and `i`. The value of `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list, and the value of `i` is 2.

The `script` list originally contains one string, and now it contains two strings. The first string is the original string (its exact value depends on external logic not provided), and the second string is `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 that must have at least 2 filenames, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing two strings (the first string is the original string, and the second string is `f'move {file} {i}'`), `i` is 2, `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 that must have at least 2 filenames, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing two strings, the first string is the original string and the second string is `f'move {file} {i}'`, `i` is 2, `file` is the second filename in the `examples` list**
