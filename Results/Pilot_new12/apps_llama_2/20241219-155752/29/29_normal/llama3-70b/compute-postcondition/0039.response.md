Functionality: The function reads a series of input lines, where each line contains a filename and a type, and the number of lines is specified by a preceding positive integer. It then sorts these files based on their type, prioritizing type 1 (example tests) over type 0 (regular tests). The function generates a script that includes 'move' commands for each file, where example tests are moved first followed by regular tests, with each file being assigned a unique index starting from 1. The function then prints the number of 'move' commands in the script and the commands themselves. If there are no files of either type, the function will simply print '0'. The function does not handle cases where the input is malformed or where the number of lines does not match the specified integer, and it assumes that all filenames are unique. After execution, the program's state will be that all input lines have been processed, and the generated script has been printed to the console, with the files being reordered based on their type and assigned a new index in the script.
