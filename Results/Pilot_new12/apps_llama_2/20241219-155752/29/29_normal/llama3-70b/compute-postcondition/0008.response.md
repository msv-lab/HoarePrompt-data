According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` (the loop counter) is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2. Since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be 1 (since it starts at 0) and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2 is not required, it must be greater than 1, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuples `(name, int(type_))` including the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string**
