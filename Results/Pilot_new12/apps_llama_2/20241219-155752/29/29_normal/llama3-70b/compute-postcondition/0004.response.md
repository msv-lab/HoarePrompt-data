The code appends a tuple containing `name` and the integer value of `type_` to the `files` list. The integer value of `type_` is either 0 or 1, since `type_` is either '0' or '1'. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `filenames` are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, `types` are either 0 or 1, `files` is a list containing the tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is a string, and `type_` is either '0' or '1'**
