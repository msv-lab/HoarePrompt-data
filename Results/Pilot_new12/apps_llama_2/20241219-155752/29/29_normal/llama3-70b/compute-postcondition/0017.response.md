The code appends a string to the `script` list. The string is in the format 'move {file} {i}', where `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 1. 

The `script` list was initially empty, so now it contains one string: 'move {file} {i}'. We substitute the values of `file` and `i` into this string. Since `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 1, the string becomes 'move {first filename in examples} 1'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 that must have at least 1 filename, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing one string 'move {first filename in examples} 1', `i` is 1, `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list**
