The code sorts the `files` list in descending order based on the type of each file (the second element of each tuple). The `key` argument of the `sort` method is a lambda function that returns the second element of each tuple (`x[1]`), and the `reverse=True` argument makes the sorting in descending order.

The original values of `n` and the fact that `files` is a list of `n` tuples are not affected by the code. Each tuple still contains a filename and a type, and the types are still either 0 or 1.

After sorting, the tuples with type 1 come before the tuples with type 0. The order of tuples with the same type is not changed, as the sorting is stable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (an integer, either 0 or 1), sorted in descending order by type.**
