The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints, it is implied that the function takes a series of input lines where each line contains a filename and a type. The filenames are distinct strings consisting of digits and small English letters with lengths between 1 and 6 characters, and the type is either 0 for a regular test or 1 for an example test. The number of these input lines is determined by a positive integer n, which is provided before these lines.

Since the specific output is not described in the problem statement, I will provide a general description based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of input lines, where each line contains a filename and a type, and the number of lines is specified by a preceding positive integer, and returns an unspecified output based on these inputs.**
