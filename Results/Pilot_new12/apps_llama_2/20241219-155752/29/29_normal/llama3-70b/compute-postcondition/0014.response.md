The given code creates a new list called `regular` that includes the filenames from the `files` list where the type is 0. The initial state contains `n` as a positive integer, `files` as a sorted list of `n` tuples, and `examples` as a list of filenames of type 1 from the `files` list.

The code does not modify the values of `n`, `files`, or `examples`. It only creates a new list `regular`.

The `regular` list is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0.

The output state is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type, sorted in descending order by type, 
`examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 from the `files` list, 
`regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename and a type, sorted in descending order by type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1 from the `files` list, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0**
