The code `print(len(script))` prints the length of the `script` list. The length of the `script` list is equal to the total number of filenames in `examples` and `regular`. Since `examples` and `regular` are lists of filenames from `files`, and `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, the total number of filenames in `examples` and `regular` is equal to the number of tuples in `files` where the type is either 0 or 1.

The `script` list includes a string for each filename in `examples` and `regular`, so the length of the `script` list is equal to the number of filenames in `examples` and `regular`. Therefore, the output of `print(len(script))` is the number of filenames in `examples` and `regular`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings including 'move {filename} {index}' for each filename in `examples` and 'move {file} {i}' for each filename in `regular`, and the length of `script` has been printed as `len(examples) + len(regular)`.**
