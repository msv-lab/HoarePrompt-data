You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a positive integer n, followed by n lines, where each line contains a string filename and a type (either 0 for regular test or 1 for example test), and all filenames are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (an integer, either 0 or 1), and the original `filenames` and `types` are accumulated as pairs in the `files` list.
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings in the format 'move {filename} {index}' for each filename in `examples`, where {index} ranges from 1 to the length of `examples`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty.
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings including 'move {filename} {index}' for each filename in `examples` and 'move {file} {i}' for each filename in `regular`, where `i` ranges from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is an empty list or a list of strings where all lines have been printed, `line` is the last line in the `script` or undefined if `script` was empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function reads a series of input lines, where each line contains a filename and a type, and the number of lines is specified by a preceding positive integer. It then sorts these files based on their type, prioritizing type 1 (example tests) over type 0 (regular tests). The function generates a script that includes 'move' commands for each file, where example tests are moved first followed by regular tests, with each file being assigned a unique index starting from 1. The function then prints the number of 'move' commands in the script and the commands themselves. If there are no files of either type, the function will simply print '0'. The function does not handle cases where the input is malformed or where the number of lines does not match the specified integer, and it assumes that all filenames are unique. After execution, the program's state will be that all input lines have been processed, and the generated script has been printed to the console, with the files being reordered based on their type and assigned a new index in the script.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
