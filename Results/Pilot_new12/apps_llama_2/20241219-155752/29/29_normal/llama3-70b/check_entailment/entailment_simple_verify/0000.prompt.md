You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not correctly handle the case where a file with a name that is a digit and is already occupied by another file needs to be moved to a new location. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 1
2 1
3 0
4 0
5 0
```

In this case, the code will move the files with names "1" and "2" to the same locations, but it will not handle the fact that the files with names "3", "4", and "5" are already in the locations where they need to be. 

The code simply moves each file to its target location without considering whether the target location is already occupied by another file. This can lead to incorrect results if the target location is already occupied.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to handle the case where a file with a name that is a digit and is already occupied by another file needs to be moved to a new location. This requires using a temporary file name to move the file out of the way before moving the original file to its target location.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to correctly handle this case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    temp_name = "temp"
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp_name}')
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {temp_name} {str(i)}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp_name}')
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {temp_name} {str(i)}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
```

This code uses a temporary file name to move the file out of the way before moving the original file to its target location, which correctly handles the case where a file with a name that is a digit and is already occupied by another file needs to be moved to a new location.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a positive integer n, followed by n lines, where each line contains a string filename and a type (either 0 for regular test or 1 for example test), and all filenames are distinct strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (an integer, either 0 or 1), and the original `filenames` and `types` are accumulated as pairs in the `files` list.
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings in the format 'move {filename} {index}' for each filename in `examples`, where {index} ranges from 1 to the length of `examples`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty.
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list of strings including 'move {filename} {index}' for each filename in `examples` and 'move {file} {i}' for each filename in `regular`, where `i` ranges from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is an empty list or a list of strings where all lines have been printed, `line` is the last line in the `script` or undefined if `script` was empty.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
