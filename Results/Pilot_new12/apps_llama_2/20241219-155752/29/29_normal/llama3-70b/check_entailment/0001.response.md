Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the file name is the same as the target name after the move operation. According to the problem description, if there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. However, the program does not check if the file name is the same as the target name, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 1
2 0
2 1
```
The program will output:
```
4
move 1 1
move 2 2
move 2 3
move 3 2
```
However, this output is incorrect because the file "2" is moved to "2" which is the same file, and then the file "2" is moved to "3" and finally the file "3" is moved to "2". This is not the expected behavior.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the file name is the same as the target name before performing the move operation. If they are the same, the program should skip the move operation or handle it in a different way.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where the target name is already occupied by another file. According to the problem description, if there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. However, the program does not check if the target name is already occupied by another file, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 1
1 0
```
The program will output:
```
2
move 1 1
move 1 2
```
However, this output is incorrect because the file "1" is moved to "1" which is the same file, and then the file "1" is moved to "2". This is not the expected behavior.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the target name is already occupied by another file before performing the move operation. If it is occupied, the program should handle it in a different way, such as by renaming the existing file before performing the move operation.
