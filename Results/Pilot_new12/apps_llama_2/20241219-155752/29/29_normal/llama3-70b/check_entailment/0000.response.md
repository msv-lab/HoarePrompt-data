Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not correctly handle the case where a file with a name that is a digit and is already occupied by another file needs to be moved to a new location. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 1
2 1
3 0
4 0
5 0
```

In this case, the code will move the files with names "1" and "2" to the same locations, but it will not handle the fact that the files with names "3", "4", and "5" are already in the locations where they need to be. 

The code simply moves each file to its target location without considering whether the target location is already occupied by another file. This can lead to incorrect results if the target location is already occupied.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to handle the case where a file with a name that is a digit and is already occupied by another file needs to be moved to a new location. This requires using a temporary file name to move the file out of the way before moving the original file to its target location.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to correctly handle this case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    temp_name = "temp"
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp_name}')
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {temp_name} {str(i)}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        if file == str(i):
            continue
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {str(i)} {temp_name}')
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        if str(i) in examples or str(i) in regular:
            script.append(f'move {temp_name} {str(i)}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
```

This code uses a temporary file name to move the file out of the way before moving the original file to its target location, which correctly handles the case where a file with a name that is a digit and is already occupied by another file needs to be moved to a new location.
