You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the file name is the same as the target name after the move operation. According to the problem description, if there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. However, the program does not check if the file name is the same as the target name, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 1
2 0
2 1
```
The program will output:
```
4
move 1 1
move 2 2
move 2 3
move 3 2
```
However, this output is incorrect because the file "2" is moved to "2" which is the same file, and then the file "2" is moved to "3" and finally the file "3" is moved to "2". This is not the expected behavior.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the file name is the same as the target name before performing the move operation. If they are the same, the program should skip the move operation or handle it in a different way.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where the target name is already occupied by another file. According to the problem description, if there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. However, the program does not check if the target name is already occupied by another file, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
1 1
1 0
```
The program will output:
```
2
move 1 1
move 1 2
```
However, this output is incorrect because the file "1" is moved to "1" which is the same file, and then the file "1" is moved to "2". This is not the expected behavior.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the target name is already occupied by another file before performing the move operation. If it is occupied, the program should handle it in a different way, such as by renaming the existing file before performing the move operation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function reads a series of input lines, where each line contains a filename and a type, and the number of lines is specified by a preceding positive integer. It then sorts these files based on their type, prioritizing type 1 (example tests) over type 0 (regular tests). The function generates a script that includes 'move' commands for each file, where example tests are moved first followed by regular tests, with each file being assigned a unique index starting from 1. The function then prints the number of 'move' commands in the script and the commands themselves. If there are no files of either type, the function will simply print '0'. The function does not handle cases where the input is malformed or where the number of lines does not match the specified integer, and it assumes that all filenames are unique. After execution, the program's state will be that all input lines have been processed, and the generated script has been printed to the console, with the files being reordered based on their type and assigned a new index in the script.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
