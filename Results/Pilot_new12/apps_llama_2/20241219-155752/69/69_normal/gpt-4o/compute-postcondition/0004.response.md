The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `final_y` was 0, so the new value of `final_y` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, the first character of the `operations` string, `op`, is 'U'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, the first character of the `operations` string, `op`, is 'U'**
