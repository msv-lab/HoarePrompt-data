The code decreases the value of `final_y` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still a positive integer, `operations` is still a string of length `n`, `x` is still an integer, `y` is still an integer, `final_x` is still 0, and `op` is still 'D'. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, and the current value of `op` is 'D'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, and the current value of `op` is 'D'**
