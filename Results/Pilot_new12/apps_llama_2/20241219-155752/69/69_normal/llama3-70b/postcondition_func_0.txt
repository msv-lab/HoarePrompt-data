The function reads input from three lines: a positive integer `n`, a string of `n` characters containing 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' representing operations, and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net outcome of the operations (`ux` for right-left operations and `uy` for up-down operations) and determines the final position (`dx`, `dy`) considering the input integers and operations. If the final position (`dx` or `dy`) is negative, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of operations that cannot be performed (`res`) and prints this count. The function handles all operations and edge cases as defined in the code, including cases where `dx` or `dy` is negative, and cases where the operations cannot be performed as specified. The final state of the program includes the output of either `-1` if the final position is negative or the count of unperformed operations (`res`) otherwise, with all variables retaining their calculated values.
