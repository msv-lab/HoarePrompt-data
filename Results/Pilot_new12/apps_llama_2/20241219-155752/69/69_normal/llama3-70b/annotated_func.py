#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but the input to the program consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n, the second line contains a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and the third line contains two integers x and y.
def func():
    n = int(input())

    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:

        elif op == 'D':

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters, `x` and `y` are the original input integers, `ux` and `uy` represent the net outcome of all operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` and `dy` are the final positions considering all operations and constraints, and `res` is the count of operations that could not be performed.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If `dx` (the difference between `x` and `ux`) is less than 0 or `dy` (the difference between `y` and `uy`) is less than 0, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `res` (the count of operations that could not be performed) has been returned, where `dx` and `dy` are the final positions considering all operations and constraints.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from three lines: a positive integer `n`, a string of `n` characters containing 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' representing operations, and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net outcome of the operations (`ux` for right-left operations and `uy` for up-down operations) and determines the final position (`dx`, `dy`) considering the input integers and operations. If the final position (`dx` or `dy`) is negative, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of operations that cannot be performed (`res`) and prints this count. The function handles all operations and edge cases as defined in the code, including cases where `dx` or `dy` is negative, and cases where the operations cannot be performed as specified. The final state of the program includes the output of either `-1` if the final position is negative or the count of unperformed operations (`res`) otherwise, with all variables retaining their calculated values.
