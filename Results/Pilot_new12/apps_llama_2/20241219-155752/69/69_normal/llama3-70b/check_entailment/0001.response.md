Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. 

The issue with the program is that it tries to find a single stretch of operations that can be changed to achieve the target coordinates, but it does not consider all possible subsegments of the operation sequence.

For example, if we have the operation sequence "RRRR" and we want to reach the coordinates (2, 0), the program will incorrectly print -1, because it does not consider changing the first and last operations to "L" and keeping the middle operations the same, which would achieve the target coordinates.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks for operations that can be changed to move in the same direction as the target coordinate. For example, if we have the operation sequence "UUUU" and we want to reach the coordinates (0, -2), the program will incorrectly count all operations as needing to be changed, because it does not consider changing some of the "U" operations to "D" operations.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible subsegments of the operation sequence and all possible changes to the operations in those subsegments. This can be done using a brute force approach, trying all possible subsegments and changes, or using a more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    if (x - ux, y - uy) == (0, 0):
        print(0)
    else:
        min_length = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                for new_ops in generate_ops(ops, i, j):
                    (nx, ny) = (0, 0)
                    for op in new_ops:
                        if op == 'U':
                            ny += 1
                        elif op == 'D':
                            ny -= 1
                        elif op == 'R':
                            nx += 1
                        elif op == 'L':
                            nx -= 1
                    if (nx, ny) == (x, y):
                        min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
        if min_length == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_length)

def generate_ops(ops, start, end):
    for new_ops in product(['U', 'D', 'L', 'R'], repeat=end-start+1):
        yield ops[:start] + ''.join(new_ops) + ops[end+1:]

from itertools import product
func()
```
This corrected program generates all possible subsegments of the operation sequence and tries all possible changes to the operations in those subsegments. It then checks if the resulting operation sequence achieves the target coordinates, and if so, it updates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. If no such subsegment is found, it prints -1. 

However, please note that this corrected program has an exponential time complexity due to the brute force approach, and it may not be efficient for large inputs. A more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming, may be needed to solve this problem efficiently.
