You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. 

The issue with the program is that it tries to find a single stretch of operations that can be changed to achieve the target coordinates, but it does not consider all possible subsegments of the operation sequence.

For example, if we have the operation sequence "RRRR" and we want to reach the coordinates (2, 0), the program will incorrectly print -1, because it does not consider changing the first and last operations to "L" and keeping the middle operations the same, which would achieve the target coordinates.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks for operations that can be changed to move in the same direction as the target coordinate. For example, if we have the operation sequence "UUUU" and we want to reach the coordinates (0, -2), the program will incorrectly count all operations as needing to be changed, because it does not consider changing some of the "U" operations to "D" operations.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible subsegments of the operation sequence and all possible changes to the operations in those subsegments. This can be done using a brute force approach, trying all possible subsegments and changes, or using a more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    if (x - ux, y - uy) == (0, 0):
        print(0)
    else:
        min_length = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                for new_ops in generate_ops(ops, i, j):
                    (nx, ny) = (0, 0)
                    for op in new_ops:
                        if op == 'U':
                            ny += 1
                        elif op == 'D':
                            ny -= 1
                        elif op == 'R':
                            nx += 1
                        elif op == 'L':
                            nx -= 1
                    if (nx, ny) == (x, y):
                        min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
        if min_length == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_length)

def generate_ops(ops, start, end):
    for new_ops in product(['U', 'D', 'L', 'R'], repeat=end-start+1):
        yield ops[:start] + ''.join(new_ops) + ops[end+1:]

from itertools import product
func()
```
This corrected program generates all possible subsegments of the operation sequence and tries all possible changes to the operations in those subsegments. It then checks if the resulting operation sequence achieves the target coordinates, and if so, it updates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. If no such subsegment is found, it prints -1. 

However, please note that this corrected program has an exponential time complexity due to the brute force approach, and it may not be efficient for large inputs. A more efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming, may be needed to solve this problem efficiently.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input from three lines: a positive integer `n`, a string of `n` characters containing 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' representing operations, and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net outcome of the operations (`ux` for right-left operations and `uy` for up-down operations) and determines the final position (`dx`, `dy`) considering the input integers and operations. If the final position (`dx` or `dy`) is negative, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of operations that cannot be performed (`res`) and prints this count. The function handles all operations and edge cases as defined in the code, including cases where `dx` or `dy` is negative, and cases where the operations cannot be performed as specified. The final state of the program includes the output of either `-1` if the final position is negative or the count of unperformed operations (`res`) otherwise, with all variables retaining their calculated values.
