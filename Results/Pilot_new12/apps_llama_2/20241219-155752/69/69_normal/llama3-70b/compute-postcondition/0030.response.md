There is an error in the given code snippet. The variable name is misspelled as `uy` instead of `y`. Assuming the correct variable name is `y`, the code snippet should be `y += 1`.

Now, let's analyze the code snippet: 
The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` is an input integer, so the new value of `y` is the input integer plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer plus 1**
