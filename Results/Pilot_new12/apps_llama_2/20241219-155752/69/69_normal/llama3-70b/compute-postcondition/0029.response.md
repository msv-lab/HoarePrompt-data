According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops`. If `ops` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ops` must have at least two more characters at the beginning of the last iteration, so at the start of the next iteration `ops` must have at least one more character. The values of `x` and `y` and `n` are not affected by the loop iteration directly.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers**
