The code `uy -= 1` decrements the value of `uy` by 1. The previous value of `uy` is not specified, so we can only express the new value of `uy` as `uy - 1` or the previous value of `uy` decreased by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, and `uy` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` remains unchanged, `uy` is `uy - 1`, `lx` remains unchanged, and `ly` remains unchanged**
