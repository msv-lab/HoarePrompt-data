Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the next operation `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1. If the next operation `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1, and `uy`, `lx`, `ly` remain unchanged. In both cases, the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` after the operation 'R' is executed, but only `ux` is updated when 'L' is executed.**
