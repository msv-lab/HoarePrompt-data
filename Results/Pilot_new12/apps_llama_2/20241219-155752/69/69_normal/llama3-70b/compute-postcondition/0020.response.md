To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `ops` is a non-empty string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- The first character in `ops`, referred to as `op`, determines the values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.

The loop statement is `for op in ops:`. This means the loop will iterate over each character in the string `ops`.

For the loop to execute again (i.e., move to the next iteration), it needs to process the next character in the string `ops`. Since we're considering the state after the previous iteration, `op` would have been the first character in `ops` during the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, the next character in `ops` needs to be considered.

Given:
- `n` remains the same since it's the length of the string `ops`, which doesn't change.
- `ops` still has the same characters, but the loop has moved past the first character.
- `x` and `y` are input integers, and their values don't change based on the iteration of the loop over `ops`. However, their values can change within the loop body based on the operations 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', but that's not specified in the given state.

Adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop has moved past the first character, if the first character was 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', we now consider the next character in `ops`.
- The values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` will depend on the next character in `ops`, not the previous one.
- `ops` must have at least one more character for the loop to execute again, meaning the loop hasn't reached the end of `ops` yet.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` is still a positive integer.
- `ops` must have at least one more character beyond the one just processed.
- The next character in `ops` (now considered as `op`) determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.
- `x` and `y` are the same input integers unless changed within the loop body, which is not specified.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, and the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.**
