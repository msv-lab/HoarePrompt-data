Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 3 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the third character in `ops`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `dy` is updated according to its rules. Otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are updated according to their rules, and `res` is incremented by 1 from its previous state.***
