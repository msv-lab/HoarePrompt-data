The value of `ux` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, and the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`. The new value of `ux` is `ux - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is `ux - 1`, `uy` is unchanged, `lx` is unchanged, `ly` is unchanged**
