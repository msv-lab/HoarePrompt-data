Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, initially `lx` is 0, initially `ly` is 0, `dx` is the current value of `x - ux`, `dy` is the current value of `y - uy`, and either the current value of `dx` is less than 0 or the current value of `dy` is less than 0**
