Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, initially `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 0, `op` is the first character in `ops`, and either initially `op` is not 'U' or initially `dy` is less than or equal to 0. The current value of `op` is 'D' and the current value of `dy` is less than 0, meaning the current value of `y` is less than `uy`**
