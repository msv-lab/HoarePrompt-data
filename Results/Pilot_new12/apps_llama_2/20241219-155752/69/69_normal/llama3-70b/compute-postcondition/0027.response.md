Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the next operation `op` is 'D', then `ux` remains unchanged, `uy` is `uy - 1`, and `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged. If the next operation `op` is not 'D', then if `op` is 'R', `ux` is increased by 1, and if `op` is 'L', `ux` is decreased by 1, with `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remaining unchanged in the case of 'L'. In the case of 'R', the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` after the operation 'R' is executed.***
