The code increments the value of `ux` by 1. The values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` must have at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is increased by 1, and the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`.**
