Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations plus the first operation if it's 'R' or minus if it's 'L', `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations plus the first operation if it's 'U' or minus if it's 'D', `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the second character in `ops`, and `dx` and `dy` are updated as follows: if `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1; if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `dx` and `dy` are updated based on the first operation and `res` is increased by 1.**
