The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it relies on input from three lines: 
1. A positive integer `n`, 
2. A string `s` of `n` characters where each character is one of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', 
3. Two integers `x` and `y`. 

After executing the function body, the return value is not specified in the problem. 


Since there is no information about the return value, the functionality can't be fully described, but the input structure is clear.


Functionality: **The function accepts input from three lines: a positive integer, a string of a specified length containing 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and two integers.**
