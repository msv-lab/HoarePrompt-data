Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, if `op` is 'D', then `y` is an input integer decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is an input integer plus 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is an input integer decreased by 1. For any other `op`, `x` and `y` are the input integers.**
