The value of `ux` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ux` was 0, so the new value of `ux` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a non-empty string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, the current value of `ux` is 1, the current value of `uy` is 0, the current value of `lx` is 0, the current value of `ly` is 0, `op` is 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a non-empty string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is 'R'**
