Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a non-empty string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the first character in `ops`, `op` is not 'U', `op` is not 'D', and `op` is not 'R', which implies `op` is 'L'**
