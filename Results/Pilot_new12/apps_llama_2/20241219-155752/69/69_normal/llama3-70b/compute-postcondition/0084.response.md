Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If `dx` (the difference between `x` and `ux`) is less than 0 or `dy` (the difference between `y` and `uy`) is less than 0, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `res` (the count of operations that could not be performed) has been returned, where `dx` and `dy` are the final positions considering all operations and constraints.***
