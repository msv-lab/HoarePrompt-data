The variable `ux` is decreased by 1. However, `ux` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `ux` is a new variable or its value was defined before, we can only say that its value is decreased by 1, but we cannot provide its new value because its initial value is unknown.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, and `x` and `y` are input integers. The states of these variables are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is decreased by 1**
