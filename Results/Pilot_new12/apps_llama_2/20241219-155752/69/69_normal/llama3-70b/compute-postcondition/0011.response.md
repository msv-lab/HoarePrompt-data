Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a non-empty string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, the current value of `ux` is 0, the current value of `uy` is 0, the current value of `lx` is 0, the current value of `ly` is 0, `op` is the first character in `ops`, the current value of `op` is 'R', and `op` is not 'U' and not 'D', which is already satisfied since `op` is 'R'**
