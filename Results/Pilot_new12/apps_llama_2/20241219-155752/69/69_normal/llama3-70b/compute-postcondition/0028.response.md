Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the next operation `op` is 'U', then `uy` is `uy + 1`, and the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `lx`, and `ly`. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is `uy - 1`, and `ux`, `lx`, and `ly` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1, and the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1, with `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` remaining unchanged.**
