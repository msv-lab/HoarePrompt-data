The code assigns the values of `x` and `y` from the input. `x` and `y` are assigned integer values from the input, where the input is split into two parts and each part is converted to an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x` and `y` are input integers**
