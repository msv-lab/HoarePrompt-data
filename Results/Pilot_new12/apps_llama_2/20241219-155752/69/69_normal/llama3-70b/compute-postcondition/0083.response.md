The given code snippet is `print(res)`. This statement prints the value of the variable `res`, which represents the count of operations that could not be performed. 

After executing this statement, the value of `res` is printed, but the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters, `x` and `y` are the original input integers, `ux` and `uy` represent the net outcome of all operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` and `dy` are the final positions considering all operations and constraints, `res` is the count of operations that could not be performed, and the value of `res` has been returned at the output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters, `x` and `y` are the original input integers, `ux` and `uy` represent the net outcome of all operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` and `dy` are the final positions considering all operations and constraints, `res` is the count of operations that could not be performed, and the value of `res` has been returned at the output.**
