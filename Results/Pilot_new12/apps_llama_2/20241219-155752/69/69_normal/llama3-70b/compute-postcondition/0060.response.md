Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is `y - uy + 1`, otherwise, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is `x - ux - 1`, `dy` is `y - uy` and is greater than or equal to 0, `op` is 'R', and `dx` is either 0 or greater than 0, otherwise, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `res` is 0 and `dx` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise, `res` is 1 and `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, `op` is the first character in `ops`, either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is less than or equal to 0, if `op` is 'L', then `dx` is less than or equal to 0, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is not greater than 0, then `dx` is less than or equal to 0.**
