The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dx` is unknown, but it was updated according to its rules. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state had `n` as a positive integer, `ops` as a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 3 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the third character in `ops`.
