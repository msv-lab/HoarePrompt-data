The value of `uy` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The new value of `uy` is `uy + 1`. 
The initial conditions of `n` being a positive integer, `ops` having at least one more character, and `x` and `y` being input integers are still valid. 
The next character in `ops` still determines the new values of `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly`, but since `uy` has been updated, its new value is `uy + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `uy` is `uy + 1`, and the next character in `ops` determines the new values of `ux`, `lx`, and `ly`.**
