To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
dy -= 1
```
This line of code decrements the value of `dy` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters,
- `x` and `y` are input integers,
- `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations plus the first operation if it's 'R' or minus if it's 'L',
- `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations plus the first operation if it's 'U' or minus if it's 'D',
- `lx` is 0,
- `ly` is 0,
- `op` is the second character in `ops`,
- `dx` and `dy` are updated based on the first operation.

The only variable affected by the code is `dy`. The value of `dy` decreases by 1.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for all variables except `dy`, which is decremented by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations plus the first operation if it's 'R' or minus if it's 'L', `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations plus the first operation if it's 'U' or minus if it's 'D', `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the second character in `ops`, `dx` remains as updated based on the first operation, and `dy` is `dy - 1`.**
