The code provided is `uy -= 1`. Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, and `x` and `y` are input integers. However, there's a variable `uy` which seems to be a typo, and it should probably be `y` based on the context of the initial state provided.

If we assume `uy` is indeed a typo and should be `y`, then the operation `y -= 1` means `y` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` has at least one more character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer decreased by 1**
