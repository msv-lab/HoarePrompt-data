Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a non-empty string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers. If the first character in `ops`, referred to as `op`, is 'U', then `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'D', then `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0.***
