The code `dy -= 1` decreases the value of `dy` by 1. The initial state provides that `dy` is greater than 0, so after decreasing `dy` by 1, `dy` is still greater than or equal to 0. 

The other variables are not affected by the code, so their states remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy - 1`, `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, the first character in `ops` is 'U', and `res` is 0**
