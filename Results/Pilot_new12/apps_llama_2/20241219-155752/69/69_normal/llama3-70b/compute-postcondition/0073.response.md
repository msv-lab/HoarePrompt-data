The code provided is `dy -= 1`. This means the value of `dy` is decremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 3 characters,
- `x` and `y` are input integers,
- `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations,
- `lx` is 0,
- `ly` is 0,
- `op` is the third character in `ops`,
- `dx` and `dy` are updated according to their rules,

After executing `dy -= 1`, the value of `dy` decreases by 1, but its new value is `dy - 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 3 characters, 
`x` and `y` are input integers, 
`ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations, 
`lx` is 0, 
`ly` is 0, 
`op` is the third character in `ops`, 
`dx` is updated according to its rules, 
`dy` is `dy - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 3 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the third character in `ops`, `dx` is updated according to its rules, `dy` is `dy - 1`**
