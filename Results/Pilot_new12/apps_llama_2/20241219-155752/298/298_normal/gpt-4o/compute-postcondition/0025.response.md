The function does not seem to have any parameters defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it appears that the function is intended to operate on the integers n, m, and k.


The function `func` accepts no parameters but is expected to utilize the integers n, m, and k. n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9. Since there is no output description given, we cannot provide the return value or functionality of the function.


However, since I need to follow the provided format and give a descriptive answer based on typical function analysis, here is the structured response:


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but is related to integers n, m, and k, where n, m, and k are constrained integers, and its functionality cannot be fully described without specific output information.**
