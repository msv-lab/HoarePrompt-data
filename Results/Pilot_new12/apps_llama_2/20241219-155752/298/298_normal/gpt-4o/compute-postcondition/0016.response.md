The code prints the string '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area`. The value of `area` is `n * m / k`, so `2 * area` is `2 * (n * m / k)`. 

Given that 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and the current values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` do not change, but '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer and equals `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed, 2 * `area` is greater than `n`, and the current value of `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`**
