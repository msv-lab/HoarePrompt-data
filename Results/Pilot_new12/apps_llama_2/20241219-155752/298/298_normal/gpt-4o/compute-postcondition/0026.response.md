Functionality: **The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user, where `1 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 10^9`. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is an integer and equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional output based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `2 * area` and `1`, then `0` and `1`. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it prints `1` and `2 * area`, then `1` and `0`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, it prints `n` and `m // 2`, then `0` and `m // 2`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after execution will be that the input variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will have been used to calculate and print the specified output, and the calculated area will have been evaluated to determine whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**
