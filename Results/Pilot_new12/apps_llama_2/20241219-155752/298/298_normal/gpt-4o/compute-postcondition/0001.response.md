The code calculates the `area` as the product of `n` and `m` divided by `k`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user, with no restrictions on their values. 

After executing the code, the value of `area` is `n * m / k`. The states of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is `n * m / k`**
