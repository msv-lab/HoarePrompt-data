The code prints the value of `2 * area` and `1`. The value of `area` is `n * m / k`, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not changed by the code. 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed. Additionally, `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer and equals `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`.**
