The given code `area = int(area)` is attempting to convert the `area` variable to an integer. Since `area` is already an integer (as specified in the initial state), this conversion does not change its value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer and equals `n * m / k`**
