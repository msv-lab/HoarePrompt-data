The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input provided. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and `map(int,...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. 

The previous constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9) are no longer valid as their values are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user, `n` and `m` can be any integer, `k` can be any integer**
