Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is an integer, then 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. Additionally, if `area` is 0, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is not equal to 0 and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1' have been printed. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, then either '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed, and '1 0' has been printed if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, or `n` and `m // 2` have been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed if `2 * area` is greater than `m`.**
