You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not work correctly for all cases. One of the main issues is that it does not correctly handle the calculation of the points for the triangle. The current implementation only checks if the area is an integer and if 2 times the area is less than or equal to n or m, and then calculates the points based on that. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated points will form a triangle with the correct area.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: 

Input: 
5 5 2

In this case, the area should be 12.5, which is not an integer, so the program should print "NO". However, even if we try to find points for the triangle with area 12 (the closest integer less than 12.5), the program's current logic does not provide a correct solution.

Another issue is that the program does not consider all possible combinations of points that could form a triangle with the desired area. It only checks a few specific cases and does not provide a general solution.

To fix this, a more robust approach would be needed, such as checking all possible combinations of points and calculating the area of the triangle formed by each combination. However, this approach would likely be inefficient for large inputs.

A better approach would be to use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle formed by three points, and then use this formula to find the points that satisfy the condition. This approach would involve more complex calculations and logic, but it would provide a correct solution for all cases. 

One potential solution could involve finding the points (0,0), (n,0), and (0,m) and then adjusting these points to get the desired area. This could involve adjusting the x or y coordinates of one or more of the points to get the correct area. 

However, this would require a more complex and robust implementation than the current program provides. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer and equals `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, 2 * `area` is greater than `n`. If 2 * `area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed, and '1 0' has been printed. Otherwise, `n` and `m // 2` have been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer and equals `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `f'{2 * area} 1'` has been printed and '0 1' has been printed. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, then either '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed, and '1 0' has been printed if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, or `n` and `m // 2` have been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed if `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is an integer and equals `n * m / k`. If `area` is 0, 'NO' has been printed to the console. If `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. Furthermore, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1' have been printed. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, then either '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed, and '1 0' has been printed if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, or `n` and `m // 2` have been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed if `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `area` is `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is an integer, then 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. Additionally, if `area` is 0, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is not equal to 0 and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1' have been printed. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, then either '1 ' and the value of `2 * area` have been printed, and '1 0' has been printed if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, or `n` and `m // 2` have been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed if `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user, where `1 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 10^9`. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is an integer and equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional output based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `2 * area` and `1`, then `0` and `1`. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it prints `1` and `2 * area`, then `1` and `0`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, it prints `n` and `m // 2`, then `0` and `m // 2`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after execution will be that the input variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will have been used to calculate and print the specified output, and the calculated area will have been evaluated to determine whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.
