Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and always follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `n * m / k`. It checks if the area is an integer. If it's not, the program prints "NO" and exits, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. If the area is an integer, the program checks if it's zero. If it is, the program prints "NO" and exits, which is correct according to the problem description.

3. If the area is a non-zero integer, the program prints "YES" and the coordinates of the first point as "0 0".

4. The program then checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`. If it is, the program prints the coordinates of the second point as `(2 * area, 1)` and the third point as `(0, 1)`. This is a valid triangle with an area of `area`, as required by the problem description.

5. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, the program checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, the program prints the coordinates of the second point as `(1, 2 * area)` and the third point as `(1, 0)`. This is a valid triangle with an area of `area`, as required by the problem description.

6. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the program prints the coordinates of the second point as `(n, m // 2)` and the third point as `(0, m // 2)`. This is a valid triangle with an area of `area`, as required by the problem description.

The program covers all possible cases and always prints a valid triangle with an area of `n * m / k` if such a triangle exists, or prints "NO" if no such triangle exists. Therefore, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
