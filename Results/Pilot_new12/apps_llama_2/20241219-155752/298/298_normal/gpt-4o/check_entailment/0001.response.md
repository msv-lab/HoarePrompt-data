Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not work correctly for all cases. One of the main issues is that it does not correctly handle the calculation of the points for the triangle. The current implementation only checks if the area is an integer and if 2 times the area is less than or equal to n or m, and then calculates the points based on that. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated points will form a triangle with the correct area.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: 

Input: 
5 5 2

In this case, the area should be 12.5, which is not an integer, so the program should print "NO". However, even if we try to find points for the triangle with area 12 (the closest integer less than 12.5), the program's current logic does not provide a correct solution.

Another issue is that the program does not consider all possible combinations of points that could form a triangle with the desired area. It only checks a few specific cases and does not provide a general solution.

To fix this, a more robust approach would be needed, such as checking all possible combinations of points and calculating the area of the triangle formed by each combination. However, this approach would likely be inefficient for large inputs.

A better approach would be to use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle formed by three points, and then use this formula to find the points that satisfy the condition. This approach would involve more complex calculations and logic, but it would provide a correct solution for all cases. 

One potential solution could involve finding the points (0,0), (n,0), and (0,m) and then adjusting these points to get the desired area. This could involve adjusting the x or y coordinates of one or more of the points to get the correct area. 

However, this would require a more complex and robust implementation than the current program provides. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
