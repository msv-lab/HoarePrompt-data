Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function provided attempts to find three integer points that form a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. However, it does not guarantee to find such points in every case.

One case where the function fails is when $2 * area$ is greater than both $n$ and $m$, but $\frac{nm}{k}$ is still an integer. In this scenario, the function will print 'YES' and some coordinates, but these coordinates do not necessarily form a triangle with the required area. For example, if $n = 10$, $m = 8$, and $k = 5$, the function will print 'YES' and some coordinates, but it's not guaranteed that these coordinates will form a triangle with an area of $\frac{80}{5} = 16$.

Another case where the function might fail is when the area is a non-zero integer, and $2 * area$ is less than or equal to $n$ or $m$, but the printed coordinates do not actually form a triangle. The function assumes that the points $(0, 0)$, $(2 * area, 1)$, and $(0, 1)$, or $(0, 0)$, $(1, 2 * area)$, and $(1, 0)$, will form a triangle with the required area, but this might not be the case.

Overall, while the function may work correctly in some cases, it does not guarantee to find the required points in every case, making it incorrect.
