You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not work correctly for all cases. One of the main issues is that it does not correctly handle the calculation of the points for the triangle. The current implementation only checks if the area is an integer and if 2 times the area is less than or equal to n or m, and then calculates the points based on that. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated points will form a triangle with the correct area.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: 

Input: 
5 5 2

In this case, the area should be 12.5, which is not an integer, so the program should print "NO". However, even if we try to find points for the triangle with area 12 (the closest integer less than 12.5), the program's current logic does not provide a correct solution.

Another issue is that the program does not consider all possible combinations of points that could form a triangle with the desired area. It only checks a few specific cases and does not provide a general solution.

To fix this, a more robust approach would be needed, such as checking all possible combinations of points and calculating the area of the triangle formed by each combination. However, this approach would likely be inefficient for large inputs.

A better approach would be to use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle formed by three points, and then use this formula to find the points that satisfy the condition. This approach would involve more complex calculations and logic, but it would provide a correct solution for all cases. 

One potential solution could involve finding the points (0,0), (n,0), and (0,m) and then adjusting these points to get the desired area. This could involve adjusting the x or y coordinates of one or more of the points to get the correct area. 

However, this would require a more complex and robust implementation than the current program provides. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user, where `1 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 10^9`. It calculates the area as `n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is an integer and equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional output based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `2 * area` and `1`, then `0` and `1`. If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it prints `1` and `2 * area`, then `1` and `0`. If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, it prints `n` and `m // 2`, then `0` and `m // 2`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after execution will be that the input variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will have been used to calculate and print the specified output, and the calculated area will have been evaluated to determine whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
