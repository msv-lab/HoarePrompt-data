You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when `n = 5`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `5 * 3 / 2 = 7.5`, which is not an integer. However, the program should output "NO" in this case. But when we consider the case `n = 5`, `m = 4`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `10`, which is an integer. The program should output "YES" in this case, but it does not guarantee to find the correct coordinates for the points in all cases.

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area. The program only checks if the area is an integer and if it's less than or equal to `n` or `m`, and then tries to find the coordinates based on these conditions. However, this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible cases, and the program may not always find the correct coordinates or may output incorrect results.

For instance, when `n = 7`, `m = 5`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `17.5`, which is not an integer. The program correctly outputs "NO" in this case. However, when we consider the case `n = 7`, `m = 6`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `21`, which is an integer. The program should output "YES" in this case, but it may not always find the correct coordinates for the points.

To make the program correct, we need to modify it to correctly calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area. This would involve finding the correct combination of `x` and `y` coordinates that satisfy the conditions `0 <= x1, x2, x3 <= n` and `0 <= y1, y2, y3 <= m`, and also form a triangle with the given area. 

One possible solution is to iterate over all possible combinations of `x` and `y` coordinates and check if they form a triangle with the given area. However, this approach may not be efficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach would be to use a mathematical formula to calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area. But this would require a more complex and sophisticated algorithm than the one currently implemented in the program. 

Therefore, the given program is not correct for all cases, and we need to modify it to correctly calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
