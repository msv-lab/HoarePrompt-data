Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

One case where the code does not work correctly is when `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`. In this case, the code prints `n` and `m // 2`, then `0` and `m // 2`, but it does not consider whether this triangle has an area equal to the desired area.

For example, if the input is `5 5 5`, the area is `5`. The code will print `YES`, `0 0`, `5 2`, and `0 2`. However, the area of the triangle with these points is not `5`, so this output is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to handle the case when `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`. 

In general, the code should find three points that form a triangle with an area equal to the desired area, or print `NO` if no such triangle exists. The current code does not guarantee this for all possible inputs.
