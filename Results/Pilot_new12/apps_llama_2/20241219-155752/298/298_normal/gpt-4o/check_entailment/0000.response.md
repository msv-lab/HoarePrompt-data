Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when `n = 5`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `5 * 3 / 2 = 7.5`, which is not an integer. However, the program should output "NO" in this case. But when we consider the case `n = 5`, `m = 4`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `10`, which is an integer. The program should output "YES" in this case, but it does not guarantee to find the correct coordinates for the points in all cases.

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area. The program only checks if the area is an integer and if it's less than or equal to `n` or `m`, and then tries to find the coordinates based on these conditions. However, this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible cases, and the program may not always find the correct coordinates or may output incorrect results.

For instance, when `n = 7`, `m = 5`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `17.5`, which is not an integer. The program correctly outputs "NO" in this case. However, when we consider the case `n = 7`, `m = 6`, and `k = 2`, the area of the triangle should be `21`, which is an integer. The program should output "YES" in this case, but it may not always find the correct coordinates for the points.

To make the program correct, we need to modify it to correctly calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area. This would involve finding the correct combination of `x` and `y` coordinates that satisfy the conditions `0 <= x1, x2, x3 <= n` and `0 <= y1, y2, y3 <= m`, and also form a triangle with the given area. 

One possible solution is to iterate over all possible combinations of `x` and `y` coordinates and check if they form a triangle with the given area. However, this approach may not be efficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach would be to use a mathematical formula to calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area. But this would require a more complex and sophisticated algorithm than the one currently implemented in the program. 

Therefore, the given program is not correct for all cases, and we need to modify it to correctly calculate the coordinates of the points that form the triangle with the given area.
