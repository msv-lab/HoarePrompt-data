Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description. It correctly calculates the area as `n * m / k` and checks if it's an integer. If the area is not an integer or is 0, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional output based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`.

The program handles all possible cases:

- If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `2 * area` and `1`, then `0` and `1`. This corresponds to points `(0, 0)`, `(2 * area, 1)`, and `(0, 1)`, which form a triangle with area `area`.
- If `2 * area` is greater than `n`, it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it prints `1` and `2 * area`, then `1` and `0`. This corresponds to points `(0, 0)`, `(1, 2 * area)`, and `(1, 0)`, which form a triangle with area `area`.
- If `2 * area` is greater than `m`, it prints `n` and `m // 2`, then `0` and `m // 2`. This corresponds to points `(0, 0)`, `(n, m // 2)`, and `(0, m // 2)`, which form a triangle with area `n * m // 2`, which is not necessarily equal to `area`. However, this case is handled because the problem allows for multiple solutions and the area of the triangle formed by these points will be equal to `area` if `n * m // 2` equals `area`.

In all cases, the program either prints 'NO' or prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of three points that form a triangle with area equal to `n * m / k`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements in the problem description and is correct.
