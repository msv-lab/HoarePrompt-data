The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the product of `x`, `a`, and `b` added to the product of `y` and `b`. Note that `x` equals `y` as per the return postconditions, which simplifies the final returned product to `x * a + x * b` or `x * (a + b)`. The function's purpose appears to be calculating and returning these values, which are derived from the output of another function `func_2(a, b)` that it calls. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the returned values, but the original parameters `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are passed by value. The function handles all integer inputs for `a` and `b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` does not have any restrictions on its inputs.
