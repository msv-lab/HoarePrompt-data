To determine the output state, we need to understand what `x` and `y` are, as they are return values of `func_2(a, b)`. Since `x` and `y` are both return values of the same function `func_2(a, b)`, and given that `a` is an integer and `b` is an integer, we can infer that `x` and `y` would be the same value because they are the result of the same function call with the same parameters.

However, without the specific implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. But we can describe the return based on the information given:

The program returns `x`, `y`, and the result of `x * a + y * b`. Given that `x` equals `y` (as they are the result of the same function call with the same arguments), the expression `x * a + y * b` simplifies to `x * a + x * b` or `x * (a + b)`.

Since `a` and `b` are integers, and `x` is the return value of `func_2(a, b)`, the program returns `x` (which is equal to `y`), and the product of `x` with the sum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **The program returns `x` (which equals `y`), and `x * (a + b)`, where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)` and `a` and `b` are integers.**
