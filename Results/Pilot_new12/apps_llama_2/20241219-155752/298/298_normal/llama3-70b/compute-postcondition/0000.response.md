To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the given code snippet does. The code assigns the return values of the function `func_2(a, b)` to the variables `x` and `y`. 

Since we don't have the definition of `func_2(a, b)`, we can't determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. However, we know that `x` and `y` will be assigned values returned by `func_2(a, b)`, and these values are determined by the integers `a` and `b`.

Given that `a` and `b` are integers, and without knowing the specifics of `func_2(a, b)`, we can only conclude that `x` and `y` will be assigned values based on the operation(s) performed by `func_2` on `a` and `b`. 

The states of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the assignment operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is a value returned by `func_2(a, b)`, and `y` is a value returned by `func_2(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is a return value of `func_2(a, b)`, `y` is a return value of `func_2(a, b)`**
