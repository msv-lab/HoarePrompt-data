Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. It accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are `1` and `0`. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with swapped and modified parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the calculated coefficients. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `b` is 0, and when `a` and `b` are negative or positive integers. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns the calculated GCD and the corresponding coefficients, without modifying the input variables `a` and `b`.**
