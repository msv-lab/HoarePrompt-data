To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(b, a % b)`.

The code:
```python
return y, x - a // b * y
```

Since `x` and `y` are return values of `func_2(b, a % b)`, without knowing the specifics of `func_2`, we can't determine their exact values. However, we can describe the operation being returned:

1. `y` is returned as is. Since `y` is a return value of `func_2(b, a % b)`, it's a result of the operation involving `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

2. The expression `x - a // b * y` involves:
   - `x`, which is the other return value of `func_2(b, a % b)`.
   - `a // b`, which is the integer division of `a` by `b`, essentially the quotient of `a` divided by `b` without the remainder.
   - `y`, as described above.

The calculation `x - a // b * y` therefore adjusts `x` by subtracting the product of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` and `y`.

Output State: **The program returns `y`, which is a return value of `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is the other return value of `func_2(b, a % b)` and `a // b` is the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.**
