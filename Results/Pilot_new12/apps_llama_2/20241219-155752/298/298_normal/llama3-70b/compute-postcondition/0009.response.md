Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function's return value is the absolute value of the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, since the GCD operation is symmetric and always results in a non-negative value. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has returned the GCD of the input integers `a` and `b`, without modifying the original values of `a` and `b`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are not integers, and assumes that the inputs are valid integers. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return the absolute value of the GCD, as the GCD operation itself ensures a non-negative result.**
