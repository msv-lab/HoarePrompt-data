The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are integers. The return value of the function depends on two cases: 
Case_1: The function returns two values, 1 and 0, where 0 is the current value of `b`. 
Case_2: The function returns the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`, where `x` and `y` are the return values of the recursive call `func_2(b, a % b)`, and `a // b` is the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return either the values 1 and 0 or the calculated result based on the recursive call and the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters a and b, returns either 1 and the current value of b, or the result of a calculation involving recursive calls with swapped and modified parameters.**
