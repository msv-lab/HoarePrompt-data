You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided code seems incomplete and doesn't solve the problem described in the problem statement. 

The problem description requires finding three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$ such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$, given integers $n$, $m$, and $k$. The provided code doesn't attempt to solve this problem directly.

For example, if we input $n=4$, $m=3$, and $k=3$, the code doesn't print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points as required. 

It appears that the provided code is implementing functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and solving linear Diophantine equations, but it doesn't use these functions to solve the triangle area problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to generate the three points such that the area of the triangle formed by them is $\frac{nm}{k}$. The provided code doesn't seem to be doing this. 

Here's an example of how the problem can be solved:
- First, calculate the desired area.
- Then, try to place the points in such a way that the area condition is satisfied.
- This can be achieved by using the formula for the area of a triangle: $Area = \frac{1}{2} * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|$.

The provided code doesn't seem to be implementing this or any other approach to solve the problem correctly. Hence, the Correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, typically used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the absolute value of its original value, since `a` is defined as the GCD of its original value and 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function's return value is the absolute value of the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, since the GCD operation is symmetric and always results in a non-negative value. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has returned the GCD of the input integers `a` and `b`, without modifying the original values of `a` and `b`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are not integers, and assumes that the inputs are valid integers. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return the absolute value of the GCD, as the GCD operation itself ensures a non-negative result.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0, where 0 is the current value of b which is an integer
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns `y`, which is a return value of `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is the other return value of `func_2(b, a % b)` and `a // b` is the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. It accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are `1` and `0`. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with swapped and modified parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the calculated coefficients. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `b` is 0, and when `a` and `b` are negative or positive integers. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns the calculated GCD and the corresponding coefficients, without modifying the input variables `a` and `b`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns `x` (which equals `y`), and `x * (a + b)`, where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)` and `a` and `b` are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the product of `x`, `a`, and `b` added to the product of `y` and `b`. Note that `x` equals `y` as per the return postconditions, which simplifies the final returned product to `x * a + x * b` or `x * (a + b)`. The function's purpose appears to be calculating and returning these values, which are derived from the output of another function `func_2(a, b)` that it calls. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the returned values, but the original parameters `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are passed by value. The function handles all integer inputs for `a` and `b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` does not have any restrictions on its inputs.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
