The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False**, and it provided a reason for this assessment. However, the annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior.

Upon examining the annotated code, we can see that the program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (implemented in `func_2` and `func_3`) to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`, as well as the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `x * n + y * m = GCD(n, m)`.

The main part of the program checks if `n * m` is divisible by `k`. If it is not, the program prints 'NO' and exits. If `n * m` is divisible by `k`, the program calculates the GCD of `n` and `m` using `func_3`. It then checks if the absolute value of `n1 * m` is greater than or equal to the GCD. If this condition is true, the program prints 'YES' and outputs three points that form a triangle with an area equal to `n * m / k`.

The annotated code shows that the program is actually designed to solve the problem described. The use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm allows the program to find the GCD of `n` and `m`, which is necessary to determine if the area of the triangle can be expressed as `n * m / k`.

The reason the original assessment was incorrect is that it did not fully understand the purpose of the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, and how they contributed to the overall solution of the problem. The annotated code provides a clearer understanding of the program's behavior and shows that it is actually a correct solution to the problem.

Final: **True**
