Correctness: **False**

The given Python program attempts to solve the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

The main issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the area of the triangle can be achieved by using points on the edges of the rectangle defined by the integers `n` and `m`. It does not consider all possible combinations of points within the rectangle.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5`, `m = 5`, and `k = 2`. The program checks if the area of the triangle can be achieved by using points on the edges of the rectangle, but it does not find a solution. However, it is possible to find three points `(2, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(1, 3)` that form a triangle with an area of `12.5`, which is equal to `nm/k`.

Another issue is that the program assumes that the `func_3` function will always return a valid solution, but this is not guaranteed. The `func_3` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not check if the resulting coefficients are valid.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
