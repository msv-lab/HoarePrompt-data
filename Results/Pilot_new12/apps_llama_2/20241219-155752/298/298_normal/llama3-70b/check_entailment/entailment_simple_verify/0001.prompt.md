You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It appears to be implementing some form of Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not address the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area. The provided functions do not seem to be related to the problem at hand.

A correct solution would involve checking if the area of the triangle can be expressed as `nm/k` and then finding three points that satisfy this condition. The program does not check for this condition, and it does not provide a method to find the points.

For example, if the input is `4 3 3`, the program should output `YES` followed by the coordinates of the points, but the provided program does not have the functionality to do this.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a different approach, such as checking if `nm` is divisible by `k` and then finding three points that form a triangle with the desired area. 

Here is a correct example in python for the problem:
```python
def find_points(n, m, k):
    if (n * m) % k!= 0:
        return "NO"
    area = n * m // k
    if 2 * area > n * m:
        return "NO"
    for x1 in range(n + 1):
        for x2 in range(x1 + 1, n + 1):
            for y2 in range(1, m + 1):
                x3 = x1
                y3 = y2 - 2 * area
                if y3 < 0 or y3 > m:
                    continue
                if (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y3) == 2 * area:
                    return "YES\n" + f"{x1} 0\n{x2} {y2}\n{x3} {y3}"
    return "NO"

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
print(find_points(n, m, k))
```
This code checks if it is possible to form a triangle with the desired area and then finds three points that satisfy this condition. If no such points exist, it outputs "NO".

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, typically used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the absolute value of its original value, since `a` is defined as the GCD of its original value and 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0, where 0 is the current value of b which is an integer
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns `y`, which is a return value of `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is the other return value of `func_2(b, a % b)` and `a // b` is the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns `x` (which equals `y`), and `x * (a + b)`, where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)` and `a` and `b` are integers.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
