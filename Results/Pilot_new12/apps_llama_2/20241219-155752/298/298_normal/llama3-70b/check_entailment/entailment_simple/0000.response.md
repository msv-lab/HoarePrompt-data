Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

The problem description asks to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

The program checks if $n * m$ is divisible by $k$ and if not, prints "NO". This is correct.

However, the program then calls the function `func_3(n, m)` which returns the values of $x$, $y$, and the greatest common divisor $g$ of $n$ and $m$. 

The program then checks if `abs(n1 * m)` is greater than or equal to `g`, and if so, prints "YES" along with the coordinates of the three points.

The issue here is that the program does not correctly calculate the coordinates of the three points that satisfy the condition of forming a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

The program uses the values of `n1`, `m1`, and `g` to calculate the coordinates of the points, but these values are not necessarily the correct values to use.

In particular, the program uses the formula `n1 * m // g` to calculate the y-coordinate of the second point, and `m1 * m // g` to calculate the x-coordinate of the third point. However, these formulas do not take into account the value of $k$ or the area of the triangle.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and may produce incorrect results for some inputs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to find three points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$ such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

This would require a different approach, such as using the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle formed by the points, and then adjusting the coordinates of the points to achieve the desired area. 

Without a correct algorithm to calculate the coordinates of the points, the program cannot be guaranteed to produce the correct results for all possible inputs, and therefore it is incorrect.
