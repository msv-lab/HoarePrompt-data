Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It appears to be implementing some form of Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not address the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area. The provided functions do not seem to be related to the problem at hand.

A correct solution would involve checking if the area of the triangle can be expressed as `nm/k` and then finding three points that satisfy this condition. The program does not check for this condition, and it does not provide a method to find the points.

For example, if the input is `4 3 3`, the program should output `YES` followed by the coordinates of the points, but the provided program does not have the functionality to do this.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a different approach, such as checking if `nm` is divisible by `k` and then finding three points that form a triangle with the desired area. 

Here is a correct example in python for the problem:
```python
def find_points(n, m, k):
    if (n * m) % k!= 0:
        return "NO"
    area = n * m // k
    if 2 * area > n * m:
        return "NO"
    for x1 in range(n + 1):
        for x2 in range(x1 + 1, n + 1):
            for y2 in range(1, m + 1):
                x3 = x1
                y3 = y2 - 2 * area
                if y3 < 0 or y3 > m:
                    continue
                if (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y3) == 2 * area:
                    return "YES\n" + f"{x1} 0\n{x2} {y2}\n{x3} {y3}"
    return "NO"

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
print(find_points(n, m, k))
```
This code checks if it is possible to form a triangle with the desired area and then finds three points that satisfy this condition. If no such points exist, it outputs "NO".
