You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function's return value is the absolute value of the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, since the GCD operation is symmetric and always results in a non-negative value. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that it has returned the GCD of the input integers `a` and `b`, without modifying the original values of `a` and `b`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are not integers, and assumes that the inputs are valid integers. Additionally, the function does not explicitly return the absolute value of the GCD, as the GCD operation itself ensures a non-negative result.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. It accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are `1` and `0`. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with swapped and modified parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the calculated coefficients. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `b` is 0, and when `a` and `b` are negative or positive integers. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns the calculated GCD and the corresponding coefficients, without modifying the input variables `a` and `b`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the product of `x`, `a`, and `b` added to the product of `y` and `b`. Note that `x` equals `y` as per the return postconditions, which simplifies the final returned product to `x * a + x * b` or `x * (a + b)`. The function's purpose appears to be calculating and returning these values, which are derived from the output of another function `func_2(a, b)` that it calls. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the returned values, but the original parameters `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are passed by value. The function handles all integer inputs for `a` and `b`, assuming `func_2(a, b)` does not have any restrictions on its inputs.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
