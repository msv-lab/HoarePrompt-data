Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The code first checks if the area of the triangle can be formed by the given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. If the area `nm/k` is not an integer, it immediately prints "NO" and exits.

The code then uses the `func_3` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. If the GCD is greater than or equal to the area `nm/k`, it prints "YES" and outputs the coordinates of the three points that form a triangle with the required area.

The output hints for the functions agree with the code and do not reveal any potential cases where the code may not work correctly. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code.

For example, when the input is `4 3 3`, the code correctly outputs the coordinates of the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, 4)`, and `(3, 0)`, which form a triangle with an area of `4`.

When the input is `4 4 7`, the code correctly outputs "NO" because it is not possible to form a triangle with an area of `16/7` using the given integers.

Since the code handles all the examples correctly and does not have any apparent issues, it is likely that the code is correct for all potential cases. However, a formal proof of correctness would require a more detailed analysis of the code and the problem description.
