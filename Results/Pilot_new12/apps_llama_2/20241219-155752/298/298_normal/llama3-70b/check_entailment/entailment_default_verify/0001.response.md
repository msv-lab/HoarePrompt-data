Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The original assessment states that the program does not meet the problem description, and after reviewing the provided code and output hints, I agree with this assessment.

The provided code does not seem to be related to the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` appear to be implementing some form of mathematical calculations, but they do not address the problem at hand.

The output hints for `func_3` suggest that it is calculating and returning values derived from the output of `func_2`, but these values do not seem to be related to the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with a specific area.

The correct example provided in the original assessment demonstrates how to correctly solve the problem by checking if `nm` is divisible by `k` and then finding three points that form a triangle with the desired area.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
