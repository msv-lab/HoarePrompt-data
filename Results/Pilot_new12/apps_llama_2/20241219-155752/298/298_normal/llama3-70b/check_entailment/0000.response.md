Correctness: **False**

The provided code seems incomplete and doesn't solve the problem described in the problem statement. 

The problem description requires finding three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$ such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$, given integers $n$, $m$, and $k$. The provided code doesn't attempt to solve this problem directly.

For example, if we input $n=4$, $m=3$, and $k=3$, the code doesn't print "YES" followed by the coordinates of the points as required. 

It appears that the provided code is implementing functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and solving linear Diophantine equations, but it doesn't use these functions to solve the triangle area problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to generate the three points such that the area of the triangle formed by them is $\frac{nm}{k}$. The provided code doesn't seem to be doing this. 

Here's an example of how the problem can be solved:
- First, calculate the desired area.
- Then, try to place the points in such a way that the area condition is satisfied.
- This can be achieved by using the formula for the area of a triangle: $Area = \frac{1}{2} * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|$.

The provided code doesn't seem to be implementing this or any other approach to solve the problem correctly. Hence, the Correctness is **False**.
