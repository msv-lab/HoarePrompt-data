Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks to find three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) such that 0 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ n, 0 ≤ y1, y2, y3 ≤ m and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (nm)/k.

The code first checks if n*m is divisible by k. If not, it prints 'NO' as it's impossible to form a triangle with the required area.

Then it calls function func_3 to find the GCD of n and m using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The function returns the coefficients x, y and the GCD.

The code then checks if the condition abs(n1 * m) >= g is met. If yes, it prints 'YES' and the coordinates of the three points. These points form a triangle with area (nm)/k.

The code handles all potential edge cases, including when n*m is not divisible by k, and when the GCD of n and m is not suitable to form the required triangle.

The annotations provided seem to be correct and match the code's behavior. They describe the state of the program before and after each function call, and explain what each function does.

The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code. For the input 4 3 3, the code prints 'YES' and the coordinates of the points (0, 0), (0, 4), (3, 0) which form a triangle with area 4. For the input 4 4 7, the code prints 'NO' as it's impossible to form a triangle with area 16/7.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as per the problem description.
