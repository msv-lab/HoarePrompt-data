Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be **True** at first glance because the provided code does not seem to directly solve the problem described. However, after analyzing the annotated version of the code, it appears that the code is actually implementing a solution to the problem.

The annotated version of the code provides the necessary insight into how the functions are being used to solve the problem. The code first checks if the area $\frac{nm}{k}$ is an integer by checking if $n * m % k$ equals 0. If it's not an integer, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it proceeds to find the points that satisfy the area condition.

The `func_3` function is used to find the coefficients $x$ and $y$ such that $x * n + y * m = gcd(n, m)$. The `func_2` function is used to find the coefficients $x$ and $y$ for the linear Diophantine equation $x * a + y * b = gcd(a, b)$. The `func_1` function is not explicitly used in the code, but it seems to be a function to calculate the GCD of two numbers.

The code then checks if $abs(n1 * m) >= g$, where $g$ is the GCD of $n$ and $m$. If this condition is satisfied, the program prints "YES" and the coordinates of the points that satisfy the area condition. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

After re-evaluating the code with the annotated version, it appears that the code is actually implementing a solution to the problem. The original assessment was **False**, but based on the annotated version, it seems that the code is correct.

The reason why the original assessment was **False** is that the code did not seem to directly solve the problem described, and the functions did not seem to be used in a way that would solve the problem. However, the annotated version provides the necessary insight into how the functions are being used, and it appears that the code is actually implementing a solution to the problem.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
