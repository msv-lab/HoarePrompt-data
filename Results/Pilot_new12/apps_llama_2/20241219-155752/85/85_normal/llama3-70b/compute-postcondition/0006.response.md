According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4 (2 * 2), because `i` is now 2 and it must be less than `n // 2 + 1`. The state of `ans` depends on the value of `i + (n - i)`, but since `i` and `n` have changed, we need to re-evaluate this expression. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` without knowing the exact value of `n`. 
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, if `i + (n - i)` is a number whose last digit is 0, then `ans` is 1, otherwise, `ans` is 0**
