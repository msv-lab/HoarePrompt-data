The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so the new value of `ans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected. The condition that `i + (n - i)` ends with a 0 is still valid because the code does not change the values of `i` or `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, and `i + (n - i)` is a number whose last digit is 0**
