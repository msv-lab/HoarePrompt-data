The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is stated that there is a parameter constraint for 'n', which implies that 'n' should be a parameter of the function. Assuming 'n' is indeed the parameter based on the provided constraints, 'n' is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. Since there is no information provided about the return value of the function, we cannot determine the specific output.


Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter n, where 2 <= n <= 10^9, but the return value is not specified.**
