Functionality: **The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 10^9`, and returns the number of iterations in the range from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive) for which the sum of the current iteration `i` and `n - i` is divisible by `10` to the power of the number of digits in `i + (n - i)` minus 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program will be that the input integer `n` has been processed, and the count of iterations meeting the specified condition has been printed to the console, effectively counting the instances where `n` (which is equivalent to `i + (n - i)`) meets the divisibility condition. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and does not handle cases where the input is not within the specified range, as it relies on the user to provide a valid integer input. The function's purpose is to perform this specific calculation based on the input `n` and output the result, without altering the original input value or handling potential errors that may occur if the input does not adhere to the expected range or data type.**
