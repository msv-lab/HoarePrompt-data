The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, but this constraint is overwritten by the new value of `n` from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
