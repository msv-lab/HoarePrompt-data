According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` (exclusive of the end value if it's not an integer, but since `n` is an integer and the division is integer division, `n // 2` will be an integer, and `n // 2 + 1` will also be an integer). For the loop to execute, `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n // 2` must be at least 1, implying that `n` must be at least 2. At the start of the loop, `i` is 1, since the range starts from 1. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
