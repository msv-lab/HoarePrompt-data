According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 6 (because 3 is less than `n // 2 + 1` when `n` is at least 6, specifically when `n` is at least 6, `n // 2 + 1` will be at least 4, so `i` which is 3 can be less than `n // 2 + 1` which is at least 4) but `n` being at least 6 doesn't change `ans`. `ans` can change depending on the condition given but as the loop is concerned `n` just needs to be large enough so `i` can be less than `n // 2 + 1`.
State: **`n` is at least 6, `i` is 3**
