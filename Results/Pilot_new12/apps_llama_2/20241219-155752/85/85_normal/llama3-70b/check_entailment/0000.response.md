Correctness: **False**.

The program provided is incomplete and does not consider all possible pairs of shovels, nor does it properly calculate the maximum number of nines that the sum of their costs can end with.

The given program only checks for pairs of shovels where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other's is `n-i`. However, this is not sufficient to find all possible pairs of shovels that satisfy the condition. 

For example, in the case where `n = 10`, the program will only consider pairs `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)`, and `(5, 5)`, but it will miss other possible pairs like `(6, 4)`, `(7, 3)`, `(8, 2)`, and `(9, 1)`.

Moreover, the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` is incorrect because it checks if the sum is divisible by a power of 10 that is one less than the number of digits in the sum, which is not equivalent to checking if the sum ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs of shovels, calculating the sum of their costs, and checking the number of trailing nines in the sum. The pair with the maximum number of trailing nines should be found, and then all pairs with that maximum number of trailing nines should be counted. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code might look:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                total //= 10
                nines += 1
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```
