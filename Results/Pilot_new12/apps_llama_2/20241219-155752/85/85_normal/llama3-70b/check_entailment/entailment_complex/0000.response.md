Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description asks for. The problem description requires finding the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, the program only checks if the sum of the current iteration `i` and `n - i` is divisible by `10` to the power of the number of digits in `i + (n - i)` minus 1, which is not equivalent to finding the maximum possible number of nines.

The problem description asks for the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost, but the program does not consider all possible pairs of shovels. It only considers pairs where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other shovel's cost is `n - i`, which is not sufficient to find all possible pairs.

For example, if `n = 7`, the program will only consider pairs `(1, 6)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(3, 4)`, but it will not consider pairs like `(2, 7)` or `(3, 6)`, which are also valid pairs of shovels. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs of shovels and check if the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The program should keep track of the maximum number of nines found so far and count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum number of nines. 

Here is an example of how the correct program could be implemented:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```
This program correctly implements the problem description and finds the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.
