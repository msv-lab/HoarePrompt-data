You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `i` is `n // 2`, and `ans` is the number of times the condition that `n` is divisible by `10` to the power of the number of digits in `n` minus 1 is met, which essentially counts the iterations if `n` ends in 0 (for `n > 9`), otherwise `ans` remains 0 if the loop executes and the condition is never met.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 10^9`, and returns the number of iterations in the range from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive) for which the sum of the current iteration `i` and `n - i` is divisible by `10` to the power of the number of digits in `i + (n - i)` minus 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program will be that the input integer `n` has been processed, and the count of iterations meeting the specified condition has been printed to the console, effectively counting the instances where `n` (which is equivalent to `i + (n - i)`) meets the divisibility condition. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and does not handle cases where the input is not within the specified range, as it relies on the user to provide a valid integer input. The function's purpose is to perform this specific calculation based on the input `n` and output the result, without altering the original input value or handling potential errors that may occur if the input does not adhere to the expected range or data type.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
