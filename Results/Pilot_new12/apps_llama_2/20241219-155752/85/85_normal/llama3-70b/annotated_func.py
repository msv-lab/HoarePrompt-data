#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `i` is `n // 2`, and `ans` is the number of times the condition that `n` is divisible by `10` to the power of the number of digits in `n` minus 1 is met, which essentially counts the iterations if `n` ends in 0 (for `n > 9`), otherwise `ans` remains 0 if the loop executes and the condition is never met.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 10^9`, and returns the number of iterations in the range from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive) for which the sum of the current iteration `i` and `n - i` is divisible by `10` to the power of the number of digits in `i + (n - i)` minus 1. After the function concludes, the state of the program will be that the input integer `n` has been processed, and the count of iterations meeting the specified condition has been printed to the console, effectively counting the instances where `n` (which is equivalent to `i + (n - i)`) meets the divisibility condition. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and does not handle cases where the input is not within the specified range, as it relies on the user to provide a valid integer input. The function's purpose is to perform this specific calculation based on the input `n` and output the result, without altering the original input value or handling potential errors that may occur if the input does not adhere to the expected range or data type.
