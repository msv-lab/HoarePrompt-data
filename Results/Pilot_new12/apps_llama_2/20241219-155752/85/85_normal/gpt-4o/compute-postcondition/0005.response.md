According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition is true when `n + 1` is a multiple of 10, which means `n` is one less than a multiple of 10. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer and `max_9s` is 1. The value of `max_9s` does not affect the loop condition. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` needs to be adjusted so that `n + 1` is still a multiple of 10, but since `n` is an integer and the loop condition is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, we can conclude that `n` must have been one less than a multiple of 10 at the end of the last iteration. 

Since we want the loop to execute one more time, we need `n` to still be one less than a multiple of 10, but since it was already one less than a multiple of 10 at the end of the last iteration, `n` must be incremented by 10 (but this is the next iteration, not what we are checking, we are only checking the end state of the previous iteration to proceed to the next one)  so for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must have ended in a state where it is 9 more than a multiple of 10 (n = 10k - 1), and then in the next iteration, will be n = 10k, but then in the next while check (n+1) % 10, then n+1 will be 10k +1 and will fail, but the question is only asking about the state after the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is one less than a multiple of 10, `max_9s` is 1**
