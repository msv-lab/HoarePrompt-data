The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. However, the code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be the integer converted from the user's input.

Since the user's input can be any integer, the range of `n` is no longer restricted to 2 <= n <= 10^9 after the code is executed. The new value of `n` is an integer, but its range is now dependent on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
