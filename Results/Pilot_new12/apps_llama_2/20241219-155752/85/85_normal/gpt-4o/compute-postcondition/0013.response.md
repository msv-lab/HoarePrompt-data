The code `print(pairs)` prints the value of `pairs` to the console. The value of `pairs` is calculated as `(n + 1) * max_9s`, where `n` is the original value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed and `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`. 

The values of `n` and `max_9s` and the expression `(n + 1) * max_9s` are not changed by the code, only the value of `pairs` which is `(n + 1) * max_9s` is printed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the original value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s` and the value of `pairs` has been printed.
Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s` and the value of `pairs` has been printed**
