The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is one less than a multiple of 10, we can express `n` as `10k - 1`, where `k` is an integer. 

After performing `n //= 10`, the new value of `n` becomes `k`, since the last digit (which is 9) is removed due to integer division.

The state of `max_9s` remains unchanged as 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer `k`, `max_9s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `max_9s` is 1**
