The function `func` accepts no parameters. 
However, based on a given problem it seems like there should be an integer `n`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `n` and the return value is missing in the task.


Functionality: **The function is supposed to accept an integer n, but since there are no parameters and return value was not specified - the functionality can not be described.**
