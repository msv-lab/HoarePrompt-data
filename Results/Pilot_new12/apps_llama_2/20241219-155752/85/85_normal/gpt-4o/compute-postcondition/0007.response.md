The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Since `n` is one less than a multiple of 10, we can express `n` as `10k - 1` for some integer `k`. After the division, `n` becomes `(10k - 1) // 10`, which simplifies to `k - 1 + (9 // 10)`, and further simplifies to `k - 1` because `(9 // 10)` equals 0. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `k - 1`, which is one less than `k`, and `k` itself was an integer since `n` was initially one less than a multiple of 10.

The state of `max_9s` remains unchanged as the code only updates `n`.

Output State: **`n` is one less than an integer `k`, `max_9s` is 2**
