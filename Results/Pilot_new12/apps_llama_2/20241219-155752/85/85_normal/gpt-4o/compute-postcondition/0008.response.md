To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop. The loop condition is `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n + 1` is a multiple of 10.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is one less than an integer `k`, and `max_9s` is 2. To satisfy the loop condition, `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. This implies that `n` must be one less than a multiple of 10.

Since `n` is already one less than an integer `k`, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be one less than the next multiple of 10 after its current value.

No adjustment is needed for `max_9s` because it does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is one less than the next multiple of 10, `max_9s` is 2**
