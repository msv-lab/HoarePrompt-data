The code assigns a new value to the variable `pairs`. The value of `pairs` is calculated as `(n + 1) * max_9s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is the original value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, and the value of `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the original value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`.
Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`**
