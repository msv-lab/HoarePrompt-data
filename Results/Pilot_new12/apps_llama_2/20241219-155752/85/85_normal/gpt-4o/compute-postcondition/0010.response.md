The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is one less than the next multiple of 10, we can express `n` as `10k - 1`, where `k` is an integer.

After the division, `n` becomes `n // 10 = (10k - 1) // 10 = k - 1 + 9 // 10 = k - 1 + 0 = k - 1` if `k` is greater than 1 and `n` becomes `n // 10 = (10*1 - 1) // 10 = 0` if `k` equals 1, since `9 // 10 = 0` and `10k - 1` for `k = 1` equals 9.

The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged as 3.

So, the new value of `n` will be `k - 1` where `k` is an integer representing the multiple of 10 minus 1 that was divided by 10 to obtain `n`, or simply, one less than the multiple of 10 divided by 10, for `k > 1`. If `k = 1`, `n` equals 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals one less than the multiple of 10 divided by 10 or simply `n` equals `k-1` for `k > 1` after division and equals 0 for `k = 1`, and `max_9s` is 3.

However, this doesn't fully capture the change in `n`. Considering `n`'s initial condition more precisely: since `n` is one less than a multiple of 10, dividing it by 10 will give a result that is the integer part of `(10k - 1)/10`, which simplifies to `k - 1/10`, and since we're doing integer division, the result is simply `k - 1` for `k > 1` and `0` for `k = 1` (when `n` starts as 9). This means the new `n` is essentially the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10.

Given the specific nature of `n`'s initial condition, a more accurate representation after division would acknowledge that `n` becomes the quotient of its original value divided by 10, without the remainder (which was always 9, hence one less than a multiple of 10). So, if `n` was `9` (for `k = 1`), it becomes `0`. For any other `n` fitting the one-less-than-a-multiple-of-10 pattern (e.g., 19, 29,...), dividing by 10 gives the tens digit minus one. However, the precise mathematical expression of `n` after division remains tied to its definition as one less than a multiple of 10, now divided by 10.

Since we started with `n` being one less than a multiple of 10 and we've divided it by 10, we've effectively removed the last digit (which was always 9), leaving us with a number that represents the tens place minus one of the original `n`, or simply put, the integer division of `n` by 10.

Therefore, a more concise and accurate Output State considering the integer division's effect on `n`'s specific initial condition is:
Output State: **`n` is the integer result of dividing one less than a multiple of 10 by 10, and `max_9s` is 3.**
