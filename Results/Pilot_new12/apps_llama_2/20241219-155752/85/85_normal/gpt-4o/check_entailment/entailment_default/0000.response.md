Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func()` calculates the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of 9s, but it does so by simply counting the number of trailing 9s in the input number and multiplying it by the input number plus one. This approach is incorrect.

The problem description requires us to find the number of pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of 9s. To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible pairs of shovels and count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs of shovels, calculating the sum of their costs, and counting the number of pairs that end with the maximum possible number of 9s.

For example, if the input is 7, the correct pairs are (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5), which have sums 9, 9, and 9, respectively, all ending with one 9. The code provided does not correctly calculate this.

The output hints provided agree with the code and help prove that the code is incorrect. They state that the function prints the product of the number without trailing 9s (plus one) and the number of trailing 9s, which is not the correct solution to the problem. 

In the case where the input is 50, the correct pair is (49, 50), which has a sum of 99, ending with two 9s. The code provided does not correctly handle this case. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
