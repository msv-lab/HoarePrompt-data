You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The program assumes that the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost of two shovels is determined by the number of trailing zeros in the number `n + 1`. However, this assumption is not always true.

One counterexample is when `n = 9`. In this case, the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost is 1, which can be achieved by choosing the pair of shovels with costs 4 and 5. However, the program will calculate `max_9s` as 1 and `pairs` as 10, which is incorrect because there is no pair of shovels with costs that sum to a number ending with 2 nines.

Another issue with the program is that it does not consider the case where the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost is 0. In this case, the program should count all pairs of shovels, but it does not do so correctly.

To fix these issues, we would need to rewrite the program to correctly calculate the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost and count the pairs of shovels that achieve this maximum. The correct approach would involve iterating over all pairs of shovels and checking the number of trailing nines in their total cost. 

For example, the following code would correctly solve the problem:

```python
def count_pairs(n):
    max_9s = 0
    max_pairs = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            count = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                count += 1
                total //= 10
            if count > max_9s:
                max_9s = count
                max_pairs = 1
            elif count == max_9s:
                max_pairs += 1
    return max_pairs

n = int(input())
print(count_pairs(n))
```

This code iterates over all pairs of shovels and checks the number of trailing nines in their total cost. It keeps track of the maximum number of nines seen so far and the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. At the end, it returns the number of pairs that achieve the maximum number of nines.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer input from the user, removes trailing 9s from the input number, calculates the number of trailing 9s, and then prints the product of the number without trailing 9s (plus one) and the number of trailing 9s. The function does not handle cases where the input is not an integer or is outside the range of 2 to 10^9. It does not return any value, only prints the calculated result. If the input number does not have any trailing 9s, the function will still output a value, which is the product of the input number plus one and zero, effectively just printing zero. The function does not validate or handle any potential exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of the input() function or the integer division operation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
