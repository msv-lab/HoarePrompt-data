Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem description. 

For example, when n = 50, the maximum possible number of nines at the end of the total cost of two shovels is two, and the only pair of shovels that can achieve this is (49, 50). However, the program calculates the number of pairs of shovels based on the number of trailing 9s in the input number, which is not the correct approach.

Another example is when n = 7. The program calculates the number of pairs of shovels as (n + 1) * max_9s, where max_9s is the number of trailing 9s in the input number. Since there are no trailing 9s in 7, max_9s is 0 and the program prints 0, which is incorrect.

The program should find all pairs of numbers (i, j) such that 1 <= i < j <= n and the sum of their costs (i + j) ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The current implementation does not achieve this.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels and calculate the sum of their costs, then check the number of trailing 9s in the sum. The pair with the maximum number of trailing 9s should be identified, and then all pairs with the same maximum number of trailing 9s should be counted. 

This is not implemented in the provided code, therefore the correctness is **False**.
