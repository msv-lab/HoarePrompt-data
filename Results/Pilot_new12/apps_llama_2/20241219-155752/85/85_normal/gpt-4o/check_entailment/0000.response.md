Correctness: **False**.

The problem with this program is that it doesn't actually find the maximum number of nines at the end of the sum of two shovels' costs. It simply calculates the number of pairs that can be formed by counting the number of nines at the end of the number `n+1`, which is not the correct approach to this problem.

For example, if we input `n = 100`, the program will count the number of pairs as `(100 + 1) * 0 = 0`, which is incorrect because the pair (49, 50) has a sum of 99, and the pair (99, 100) also has a sum that ends with a 9.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to actually check all pairs of shovels to find the maximum number of nines at the end of their sum, and then count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. 

Here is a simple Python program that correctly solves this problem:
```python
def count_pairs(n):
    max_9s = 0
    pairs = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            sum_ = i + j
            curr_9s = 0
            while sum_ % 10 == 9:
                curr_9s += 1
                sum_ //= 10
            if curr_9s > max_9s:
                max_9s = curr_9s
                pairs = [(i, j)]
            elif curr_9s == max_9s:
                pairs.append((i, j))
    return len(pairs)

n = int(input())
print(count_pairs(n))
```
This program correctly finds the maximum number of nines at the end of the sum of two shovels' costs and counts the number of pairs that achieve this maximum.
