Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, the current value of `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a`, the current value of `j` is 2. For the current values of `i` and `j`, the difference between any two elements in the subsequence of `a` from index `i` to `j` is equal to the difference between their indices, meaning the subsequence is consecutive.**
