According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `i` is 2, we can see that `i + 1` (which is 3) is indeed less than `n`. 

For the loop to execute, `j` should start from `i + 1` (which is 3) and go up to `n`. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is 3) and `j` is `i + 1` (which is 3).

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` where the difference between elements is 1, minus 1, `j` is 3**
