Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` has consecutive elements with a difference of 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 1. Otherwise, `max_erase`'s value remains unchanged.***
