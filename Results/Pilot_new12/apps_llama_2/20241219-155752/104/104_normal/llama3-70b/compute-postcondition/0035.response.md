According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 5. The loop condition is `j` in range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` (which is 5) must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

The values of `i` and `max_erase` do not affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
