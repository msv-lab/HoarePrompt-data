To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.
- The current value of `i` is 1.
- `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a`.
- The current value of `j` is 2.
- For the current values of `i` and `j`, the difference between any two elements in the subsequence of `a` from index `i` to `j` is equal to the difference between their indices, meaning the subsequence is consecutive.

The code provided is:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```
This line of code updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the current consecutive subsequence (`j - i - 1`).

Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the length of the current consecutive subsequence is `2 - 1 - 1 = 0`. 

Therefore, `max_erase` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 0. Since `max_erase` is initially defined as the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence and the length of the current subsequence is 0, `max_erase` remains unchanged if its current value is greater than 0. However, if `max_erase` was initially 0 (which could be the case if no consecutive subsequences were found before this point), it will still be 0 after this operation.

The output state, considering the update to `max_erase` and the unchanged values of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `j`, is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.
- The current value of `i` is 1.
- `max_erase` is either its previous value (if it was greater than 0) or 0, which represents the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence found so far.
- The current value of `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 0 (essentially unchanged if previously greater than 0, or 0 if previously 0), `j` is 2**
