Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, if the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` has consecutive elements with a difference of 1, then `max_erase` is at least 1, otherwise `max_erase`'s value is not updated***
