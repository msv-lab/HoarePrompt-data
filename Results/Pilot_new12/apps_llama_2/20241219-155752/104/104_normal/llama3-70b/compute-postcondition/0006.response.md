The code updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so `j - i - 1` equals 0. 

Since `max_erase` is initially 0 and `j - i - 1` is also 0, `max_erase` remains 0 after the update.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, the difference between consecutive elements of `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, `max_erase` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, the difference between consecutive elements of `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, `max_erase` is 0**
