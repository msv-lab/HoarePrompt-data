According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, and `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` where the difference between elements is 1, minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, and `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` where the difference between elements is 1, minus 1**
