The given code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` is used to take a list of integers as input from the user and store it in the variable `a`. 

Considering the initial state: `n` is the input integer, the list of integers has a length of `n` and contains `n` distinct integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, 

The variable `a` now holds the list of integers that was taken as input. The length of `a` will be equal to `n` as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, the length of `a` is `n`.**
