According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, and for it to execute again, `j` must still be within this range. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, and `max_erase` = 0**
