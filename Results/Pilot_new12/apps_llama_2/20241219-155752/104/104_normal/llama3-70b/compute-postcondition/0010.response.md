Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`. If the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, then `max_erase` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `max_erase` remains unchanged as there is no specified action for the else part.***
