Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, `max_erase` is 0. The difference between consecutive elements of `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, meaning that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the current value of `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i`.**
