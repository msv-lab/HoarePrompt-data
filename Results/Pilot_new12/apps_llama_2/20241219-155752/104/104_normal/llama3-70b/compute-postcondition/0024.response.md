To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, and `j` is 4. The given code snippet is:

```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

However, we need to note that `max_erase` is not defined in the initial state, so we will assume it is being updated or initialized with the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, `j - i - 1` equals 2.

Since the initial state does not provide a value for `max_erase`, and assuming this is an update operation (since we are taking the maximum of `max_erase` and another value, implying `max_erase` has a prior state or value), we can infer that if `max_erase` had any value less than 2, it will now be 2. If `max_erase` was already 2 or greater, its value remains unchanged.

The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2,
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is 4,
- `max_erase` is either its previous value if that value is greater than 2, or 2, whichever is greater.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
