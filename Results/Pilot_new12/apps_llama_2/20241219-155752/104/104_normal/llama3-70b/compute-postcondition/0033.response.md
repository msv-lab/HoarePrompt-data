The code `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1. 

Given the initial state: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, if the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` has consecutive elements with a difference of 1, then `max_erase` is at least 1, otherwise `max_erase`'s value is not updated.

We know that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. Thus, `j - i - 1` equals 4 - 2 - 1 = 1.

So, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is at least 1, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 1**
