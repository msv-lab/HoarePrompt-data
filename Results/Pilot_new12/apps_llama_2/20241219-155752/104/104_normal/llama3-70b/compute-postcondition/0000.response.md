The input is a list of integers where the first element is a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second element is a list of n distinct integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n. The given code assignes the input to `n`. 

Since the `input` function takes an input, and `int` converts it to an integer. Given the condition that the first element of the list is a positive integer `n`, this `n` is used to represent the number of elements in the array.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, the list of integers has a length of `n` and contains `n` distinct integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n**
