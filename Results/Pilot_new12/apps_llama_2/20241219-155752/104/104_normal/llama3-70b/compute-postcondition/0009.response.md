To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`
- The length of `a` is `n`
- `max_erase` = 0

The given code is:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

Here, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `j - i - 1` equals 2 - 0 - 1, which is 1.

So, `max_erase` becomes `max(0, 1)`, which equals 1.

The states of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`
- The length of `a` is `n`
- `max_erase` is 1

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, and `max_erase` is 1**
