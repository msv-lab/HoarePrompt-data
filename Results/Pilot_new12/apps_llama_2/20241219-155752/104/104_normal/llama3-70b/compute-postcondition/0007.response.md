Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, if the difference between consecutive elements of `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, then the state of the program remains unchanged with `max_erase` being 0, otherwise the program state remains the same with `n` > 0, `i` = 0, `j` = 1, `a` being a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order and length `n`, and `max_erase` = 0**
