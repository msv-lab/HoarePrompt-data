To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`
- The length of `a` is `n`

The given code is:
```
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

To understand the impact of this code, we first need to calculate `j - i - 1`. Given `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, we have:
- `j - i - 1` = `3 - 0 - 1` = `2`

However, we don't have a specific initial value for `max_erase`. The operation `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` will compare the current value of `max_erase` with `2` and assign the maximum of these two values back to `max_erase`. 

Since we don't know the initial value of `max_erase`, we can't determine the exact value of `max_erase` after this operation. But we can say that `max_erase` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `2`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `a`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`
- The length of `a` is `n`
- `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `2`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
