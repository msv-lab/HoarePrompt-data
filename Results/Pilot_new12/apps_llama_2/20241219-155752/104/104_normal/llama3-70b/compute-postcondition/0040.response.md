The code snippet `print(max_erase)` simply prints the value of `max_erase`, which is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` minus 1. This operation does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` minus 1, and `max_erase` has been printed.**
