According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`, so `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
