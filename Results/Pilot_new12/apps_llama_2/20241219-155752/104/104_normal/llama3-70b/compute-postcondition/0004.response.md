According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Given the initial state: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will be `i + 1`, which is 1. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, `max_erase` is 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`, `max_erase` is 0**
