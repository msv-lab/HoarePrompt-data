According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3. Since `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `n`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3. The state of `a` and `max_erase` remains unchanged, as there is no specified action for them in the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`**
