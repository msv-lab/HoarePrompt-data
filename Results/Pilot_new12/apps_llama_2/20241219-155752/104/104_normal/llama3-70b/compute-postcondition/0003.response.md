According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the length of `a` is `n`, and `max_erase` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, the length of `a` is `n`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0**
