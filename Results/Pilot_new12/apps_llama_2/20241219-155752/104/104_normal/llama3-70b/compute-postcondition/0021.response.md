To calculate the result, we first need to understand the given code and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.

The given code is:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

However, the initial state does not specify the value of `max_erase`. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume `max_erase` is a variable that has been initialized before this line of code, but its initial value is not specified.

Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, the expression `j - i - 1` evaluates to `3 - 1 - 1 = 1`.

Therefore, `max_erase` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.

Since we do not know the initial value of `max_erase`, we cannot determine its exact value after the update. However, we can say that `max_erase` will be either its original value (if that value is greater than 1) or 1 (if its original value is less than or equal to 1).

The states of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and 1**
