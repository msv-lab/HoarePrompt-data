To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.
- `i` is 2.
- `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` where the difference between elements is 1, minus 1.
- `j` is 3.
- The current value of the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` has a difference of 1 between consecutive elements.

We know `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. So, `j - i - 1` equals `3 - 2 - 1` which is `0`.

The `max` function will return the maximum value between the current `max_erase` and `0`. 

Since `max_erase` is defined as the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` where the difference between elements is 1, minus 1, and we have a sequence from `i` to `j` where the difference between consecutive elements is 1, it means we have a sequence of length `j - i + 1 = 2` which is a consecutive subsequence with a difference of 1. Thus, `max_erase` should be at least `2 - 1 = 1` after considering this sequence. However, we are comparing `max_erase` with `0`, so `max_erase` will remain unchanged if it is already greater than `0`, or it will be set to `0` if it was less than `0`. Given the context, it is logical to assume that `max_erase` would not be less than `0` since we are dealing with lengths of sequences, but without the exact initial value of `max_erase`, we cannot definitively say it will change or not. 

However, since `j - i - 1 = 0`, and assuming `max_erase` initially represents the maximum length of such a sequence minus 1 (which should be at least 0 or more given the sequence from `i` to `j`), the value of `max_erase` will either remain the same (if it was already greater than or equal to 0) or become 0 (if it was less than 0, which is unlikely given the context).

Thus, considering the initial conditions and the nature of `max_erase`, we conclude that `max_erase` will either remain its current value or become 0, but given the sequence provided, `max_erase` should logically be at least 1 after this operation because we have a sequence of length 2 (from `i` to `j`) where the difference between elements is 1. 

Given this analysis, the most accurate representation of the output state, without making assumptions beyond the provided information, is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `max_erase` is at least 1 (since we have a sequence of length 2 with a difference of 1 between elements), `j` is 3**
