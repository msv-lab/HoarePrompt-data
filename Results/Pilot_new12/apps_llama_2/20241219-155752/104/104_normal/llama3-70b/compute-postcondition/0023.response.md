To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- If the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and 1.

Now, let's consider what changes at the start of the next iteration:
1. The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Since `j` is currently 3, it will become 4 at the start of the next iteration.
2. The condition for `max_erase` to be updated depends on the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j`. Since `j` is changing, this condition might be re-evaluated, but we don't have enough information to determine its new value directly. However, we know `max_erase` might be updated if the condition is met.
3. The state of `n` and the list `a` does not change as per the given information. `n` remains a positive integer greater than 2, and `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.

Therefore, considering the increments and potential updates, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
