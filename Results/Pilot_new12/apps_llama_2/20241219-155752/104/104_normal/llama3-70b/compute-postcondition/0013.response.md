Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, the length of `a` is `n`. If all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are consecutive (i.e., `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in range `i` to `j`), then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.***
