The value of `max_erase` is set to 0, and `n` is still the input integer, `a` is still a list of `n` distinct integers such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, the length of `a` is `n`, and `max_erase` is 0**
