Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` where the difference between elements is 1, minus 1, `j` is 3. The current value of the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` has a difference of 1 between consecutive elements, meaning that for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to `k - i`.**
