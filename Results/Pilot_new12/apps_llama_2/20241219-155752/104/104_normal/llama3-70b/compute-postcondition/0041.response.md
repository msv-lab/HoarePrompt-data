The function `func` accepts no parameters but uses a predefined list of integers as input. The first element of the list is a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second element is a list of `n` distinct integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`, representing the array written by Giraffe.

However, since the parameters are not explicitly defined in the function definition, I will rephrase the description based on the provided constraints.

The function `func` uses an input list of integers where the first element is a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and the second element is a list of `n` distinct integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n`. 

Since the output is not provided in the task description, the functionality description will be based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a predefined list of integers as input where the list contains a positive integer n and a sorted list of n distinct integers, and the list is used for further processing.**
