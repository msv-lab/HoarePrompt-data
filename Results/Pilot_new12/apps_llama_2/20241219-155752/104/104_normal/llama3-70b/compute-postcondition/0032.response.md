According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 4. The loop's condition is `j` in range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, so for `j` to be 4, `n` must be at least 4. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, if the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` has consecutive elements with a difference of 1, then `max_erase` is at least 1, otherwise `max_erase`'s value is not updated**
