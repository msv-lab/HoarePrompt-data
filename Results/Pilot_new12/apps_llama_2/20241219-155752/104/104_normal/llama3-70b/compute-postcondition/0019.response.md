Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1. If the difference between consecutive elements from index `i` to `j` is 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, and `j` is 2. Since there is no else part, if the difference between consecutive elements from index `i` to `j` is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
