Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and if the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.**
