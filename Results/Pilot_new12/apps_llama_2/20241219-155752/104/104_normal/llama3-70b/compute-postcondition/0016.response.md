To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state:

Given loop: `for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):`

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a`.

Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value.
- Since `i` is initially 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the condition for the loop to start executing is already met.
- The loop variable `j` will start from `i + 1`, which is 2, and go up to `n` (inclusive).
- The state of `a` (the list of integers) and `max_erase` (the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence) does not directly affect the loop's ability to start executing, but they are part of the initial state.
- For the loop to execute, `j` needs to be initialized to `i + 1`, which is 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a`, `j` is 2**
