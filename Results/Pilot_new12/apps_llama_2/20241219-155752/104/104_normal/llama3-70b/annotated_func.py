#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of integers where the first element is a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second element is a list of n distinct integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, representing the array written by Giraffe.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, and `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` minus 1.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input through user prompts, where the first input is a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second input is a list of n distinct integers. It processes this list to find the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1, and prints this value. The function assumes the input list is ordered in ascending order and contains distinct integers. The function's output is the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1, which can be used for further analysis or processing. The state of the program after execution is that it has printed the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1, and the input variables (n and the list of integers) have been used and discarded. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by considering all possible subsequences and returning the maximum length minus 1. However, it does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer or non-ordered inputs, or inputs that exceed the specified range.
