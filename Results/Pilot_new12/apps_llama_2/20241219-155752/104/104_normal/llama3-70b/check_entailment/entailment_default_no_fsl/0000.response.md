Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully implement the problem description. The problem requires finding the greatest number of elements that can be erased from the array, such that the remaining elements can still restore the original array using the information that the array is increasing and contains integers in the range [1, 10^3]. However, the provided code only checks for consecutive arithmetic subsequences and does not consider other possibilities for erasing elements.

For example, given the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the code correctly outputs 4 because the first 4 elements can be erased, and the remaining element (5) can still restore the original array since all elements are greater than or equal to 1. However, the code does not handle cases where the erasable elements are not a consecutive arithmetic subsequence.

Another example where the code fails is when the input is [998, 999, 1000]. The code correctly outputs 2, but the reasoning is not because it checks if the remaining elements can restore the array given the constraints, but rather because it coincidentally finds a consecutive arithmetic subsequence of length 3, and thus can erase 2 elements. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should consider all possible subarrays and check if the remaining elements can restore the original array given the constraints, not just consecutive arithmetic subsequences. 

Here's a possible correction to the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            left = a[:i]
            right = a[j:]
            if left and right:
                diff = right[0] - left[-1]
                if diff > 0 and diff - 1 <= 1000 - right[0]:
                    max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
            elif left:
                if 1 <= a[j-1] - left[-1] <= 1000 - a[j-1]:
                    max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
            elif right:
                if 1 <= right[0] - a[i-1] <= 1000 - right[0]:
                    max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
    print(max_erase)
```
