Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. 

The problem description asks to find the greatest number of elements that can be erased from the array such that the remaining elements can still restore the original array. However, the provided program is finding the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1.

The program does not consider the fact that the erased elements must be consecutive and the remaining elements must be able to restore the original array. 

For example, in the input [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9], the program will output 2 because there is a consecutive arithmetic subsequence [3, 4, 5] of length 3. However, the correct answer according to the problem description is 2 because we can erase the elements [4, 5] and the remaining elements [1, 3, 6, 9] can still restore the original array.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check all possible consecutive subsequences and see if the remaining elements can restore the original array. 

Here's an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            b = a[:i] + a[j:]
            can_restore = True
            for k in range(len(b) - 1):
                if b[k + 1] - b[k] > 1:
                    diff = b[k + 1] - b[k] - 1
                    if not all(1 <= b[k] + m <= 1000 for m in range(1, diff + 1)) or not all(b[k] + m < b[k + 1] for m in range(1, diff + 1)):
                        can_restore = False
                        break
            if can_restore:
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i)
    print(max_erase)
```
This solution checks all possible consecutive subsequences and sees if the remaining elements can restore the original array. If the remaining elements can restore the original array, it updates the maximum erase count.
