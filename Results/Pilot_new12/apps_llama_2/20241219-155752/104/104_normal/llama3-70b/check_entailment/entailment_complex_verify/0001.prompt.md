You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem statement requires that even after erasing some consecutive elements, it should be possible for Giraffe to restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. This means that if the remaining elements are consecutive integers, JATC can erase all the elements except the first and last one.

However, the given program only checks if the elements in the subarray from index `i` to `j-1` are consecutive integers, and if so, it updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. This approach does not take into account the requirement that the remaining elements should be restorable.

For example, in the input case `1 2 3 4 5`, the program correctly outputs `4`, but it does so because it checks the subarray `1 2 3 4` and finds that it has consecutive integers. However, the program does not check if the subarray `1 5` (which would be left after erasing elements `2 3 4`) is restorable, which it is because Giraffe knows that all elements are between `1` and `1000`, inclusive.

A correct approach would be to check all possible subarrays and verify that the remaining elements are restorable. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: 
5
1 2 3 4 1000

Output: 
4

However, the correct output should be 3 because if we erase the first 4 elements, the remaining element 1000 cannot be restored uniquely (Giraffe could have written any sequence of consecutive integers between 1 and 1000 before erasing). 

The given program does not handle this case correctly, which is why its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of integers where the first element is a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second element is a list of n distinct integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, representing the array written by Giraffe.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, and `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subsequence in `a` minus 1.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input through user prompts, where the first input is a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second input is a list of n distinct integers. It processes this list to find the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1, and prints this value. The function assumes the input list is ordered in ascending order and contains distinct integers. The function's output is the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1, which can be used for further analysis or processing. The state of the program after execution is that it has printed the maximum length of a consecutive arithmetic subsequence minus 1, and the input variables (n and the list of integers) have been used and discarded. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element by considering all possible subsequences and returning the maximum length minus 1. However, it does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer or non-ordered inputs, or inputs that exceed the specified range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
