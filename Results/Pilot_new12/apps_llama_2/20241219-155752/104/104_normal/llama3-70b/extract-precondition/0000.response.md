Precondition: **The input is a list of integers where the first element is a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second element is a list of n distinct integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^3) such that a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n, representing the array written by Giraffe.**
