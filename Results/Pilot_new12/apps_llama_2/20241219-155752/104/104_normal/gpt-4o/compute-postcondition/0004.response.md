To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables in the initial state. The code is:

```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `max_erase` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The code updates the `max_erase` variable by comparing its current value with the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` and assigning the maximum of these two values back to `max_erase`.

Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element in the list `a`, and `a[i - 1]` refers to the first element in the list `a`. The expression `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` calculates the difference between the second and the first elements of `a` minus 1.

Given that `max_erase` is initially 0, the new value of `max_erase` will be the maximum between 0 and the calculated difference `a[1] - a[0] - 1`. This means `max_erase` will be 0 if `a[1] - a[0] - 1` is negative (i.e., the difference between the first two elements of `a` is less than or equal to 1), or it will be `a[1] - a[0] - 1` if this difference is positive (i.e., the difference between the first two elements of `a` is greater than 1).

The states of `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum of 0 and `a[1] - a[0] - 1`, `i` is 1**
