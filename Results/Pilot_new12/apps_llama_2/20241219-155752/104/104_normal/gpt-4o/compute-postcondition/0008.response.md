To calculate the new value of `max_erase`, we need to consider the previous value of `max_erase` and the new value calculated from the list `a` at indices `i` and `i - 1`.

Given that `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is initially the maximum of `max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)` and `a[2] - a[1] - 1`, and `i` is 3, we update `max_erase` with the maximum of its current value and `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`. 

This translates to `max_erase` being the maximum of its previous value and `a[3] - a[2] - 1`.

The states of `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum of `max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)`, `a[2] - a[1] - 1`, and `a[3] - a[2] - 1`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum of `max(0, a[1] - a[0] - 1)`, `a[2] - a[1] - 1`, and `a[3] - a[2] - 1`, `i` is 3**
