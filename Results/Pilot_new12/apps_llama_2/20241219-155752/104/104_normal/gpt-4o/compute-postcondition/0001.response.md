The value of `a` is reassigned as a list of integers from the input, split by spaces. The previous condition on `a` that it was a list of integers of length between 1 and 100, where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n <= 10^3, is no longer valid. The length and values of `a` are now based on the input provided. The state of `n` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of input integers**
