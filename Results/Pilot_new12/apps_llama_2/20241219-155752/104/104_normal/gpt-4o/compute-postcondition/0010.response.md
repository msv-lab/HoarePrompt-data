To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `max_erase` is the maximum of all `a[i] - a[i-1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `max_erase` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `i` is not defined.

The given code is:
```python
print(max_erase)
```

This code simply prints the value of `max_erase` to the console. It does not modify any variables.

Given this, the output state after executing the code is:
- `n` is still an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is still a list of input integers.
- `max_erase` is still the maximum of all `a[i] - a[i-1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `max_erase` is 0. The value of `max_erase` has been printed.
- `i` is still `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `i` is not defined.

Additionally, we should note that the value of `max_erase` has been returned as a printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum of all `a[i] - a[i-1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `max_erase` is 0 and its value has been printed, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `i` is not defined**
