#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that it has access to a list of integers a of length n, such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n <= 10^3, where the list represents the array written by Giraffe.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_erase = max(max_erase, a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum of all `a[i] - a[i-1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `max_erase` is 0, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise `i` is not defined
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes input from the user, where the first input is the number of elements in a list, and the second input is the list itself. The function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list minus one, and prints this value. If the list has less than two elements, the function will print 0. The function does not modify the input list, and only uses the input to calculate and print the maximum difference. The function's output will be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive, representing the maximum possible number of elements that could be inserted between consecutive elements in the list to make it contiguous, assuming the list is 1-indexed and the first element can be considered as a starting point. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, and it does not perform any error checking on the input.
