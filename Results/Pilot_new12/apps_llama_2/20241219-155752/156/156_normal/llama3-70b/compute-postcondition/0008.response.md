The given code snippet is a print statement that prints the values 1 and 2. This statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as the print statement only outputs the values 1 and 2 to the console, but does not modify any variables. 

So, `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`. The print statement returns the value `None` after printing the values 1 and 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, and the value 1 and 2 have been printed to the console and `None` has been returned**
