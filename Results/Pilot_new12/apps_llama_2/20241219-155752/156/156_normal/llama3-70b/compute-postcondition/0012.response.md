Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer. It then calculates and prints a pair of values based on the input `n` and `k`, after applying the modulo operation `k %= n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `1` and `2`. The function does not explicitly return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`), and the input `m` is not used in the calculation. After execution, the function's state includes the printed pair of values and the modified input `k` value, while the original input values `n`, `m`, and `k` are still present in the program's state.**
