The code provided calculates and prints two values based on the initial state of the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, let's analyze the expression:

1. `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)`: This expression calculates the remainder of `(k - n + 1)` divided by `(n - 1)`. Since `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, the value of `(k - n + 1)` will be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`.

2. `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1)`: This expression calculates the integer part of the division of `(k - n + 1)` by `(n - 1)`. Given the range of `k`, this value will be 0 because `(k - n + 1)` is less than `n - 1`.

3. `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`: This expression subtracts the remainder calculated in step 1 from `n` and then subtracts 1. Since `(k - n + 1) % (n - 1)` is essentially `(k - n + 1)` due to its range being within 0 to `n - 2`, this simplifies to `n - (k - n + 1) - 1 = n - k + n - 1 - 1 = 2n - k - 2`.

4. `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`: Given the integer division result is 0 from step 2, this expression simplifies to `0 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the code prints two values: `2n - k - 2` and `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` themselves do not change; they are used in the calculation. Thus, the output state includes the printed values and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, and the printed values are `2n - k - 2` and `1`.**
