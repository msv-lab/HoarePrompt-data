It appears there's a discrepancy in the problem statement provided. The function definition is given as `def func():`, which implies that the function does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints section mentions `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints. 

To proceed with the task based on the information about the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, let's assume the function is defined with these parameters, as `def func(n, m, k):`. Given the constraints and the absence of specific output details, we will focus on describing the function's expected input parameters and infer a general return based on typical functions that might use such parameters.

The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive even integers, and `k` is a non-negative integer. Specifically, `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is less than the product of `n` and `m`. 

Given the nature of these parameters, without a specific output description, it's challenging to determine the exact return value(s) of the function. Typically, functions with such parameters might return values related to combinatorial results, grid or matrix operations, or other mathematical computations involving `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

Since there are no specific return cases described, we can only outline the general functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, where n and m are positive even integers greater than or equal to 2, and k is a non-negative integer less than n*m, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
