The code provided is a print statement that outputs the value of `k + 1` and `1`. This operation does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`. It simply prints the value of `k + 1` along with `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1,
- `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1,
- `k` is a positive integer less than `n * 2 - 2` and the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged because the print statement does not modify them. The output of the print statement will be the current value of `k` incremented by 1, along with `1`. 

Since `k` is less than `n - 1` and given that `k` is a positive integer, the printed value of `k + 1` will be less than `n` but greater than or equal to 1 (because `k` itself is at least 1, given it's a positive integer).

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer less than `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, and the value of `k + 1` along with `1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer less than `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, and `k + 1` along with `1` has been printed**
