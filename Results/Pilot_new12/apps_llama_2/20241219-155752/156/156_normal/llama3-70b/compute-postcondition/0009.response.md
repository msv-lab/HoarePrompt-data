Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, the printed values are `2n - k - 2` and `1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the values `1` and `2` have been printed to the console and `None` has been returned.***
