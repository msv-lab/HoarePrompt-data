Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer less than `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, `2n - k - 2` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, `1` and `2` have been printed to the console and `None` has been returned.**
