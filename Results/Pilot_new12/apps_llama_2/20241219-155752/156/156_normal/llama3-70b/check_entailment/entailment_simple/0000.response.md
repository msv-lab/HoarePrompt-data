Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. 

The issue lies in the calculation of the current position of Lara after she moves k times. According to the problem description, Lara moves in a snake-like fashion, first going down to the bottom left corner, then moving to the right, then up, then to the left, and so on. 

However, the program does not accurately capture this movement pattern. 

Specifically, the line `k %= n * 2 - 2` does not correctly reduce k to its equivalent position within a single cycle of Lara's movement. 

Additionally, the calculations for the row and column positions within the if-else block do not accurately reflect the movement pattern described in the problem. 

For example, when `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, the program prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which does not correctly calculate Lara's position based on the snake-like movement pattern. 

To correctly solve this problem, the program should calculate Lara's position based on the number of complete cycles she has made and her position within the current cycle. 

Here's an example of how the correct program could be implemented:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the total number of cells in a cycle
    cycle_size = (n - 1) * 2 + (m - 2) * 2
    
    # Calculate the number of complete cycles
    cycles = k // (n * m - (n - 1) * (m - 2))
    
    # Calculate the remaining steps
    remaining_steps = k % (n * m - (n - 1) * (m - 2))
    
    # Handle the first column separately
    if remaining_steps < n:
        print(remaining_steps + 1, 1)
    else:
        # Calculate the number of rows and columns in the current cycle
        rows_in_cycle = n
        cols_in_cycle = m - 1
        
        # Calculate the remaining steps within the current cycle
        remaining_steps_in_cycle = remaining_steps - n
        
        # Calculate the row and column positions
        for col in range(1, cols_in_cycle + 1):
            steps_in_col = rows_in_cycle - 1
            if remaining_steps_in_cycle < steps_in_col:
                if col % 2 == 1:
                    print(remaining_steps_in_cycle + 1, col + 1)
                else:
                    print(rows_in_cycle - remaining_steps_in_cycle, col + 1)
                break
            remaining_steps_in_cycle -= steps_in_col
```

This corrected program first calculates the total number of cells in a cycle and the number of complete cycles Lara has made. It then calculates the remaining steps within the current cycle and handles the first column separately. For the remaining columns, it calculates the row and column positions based on the snake-like movement pattern.
