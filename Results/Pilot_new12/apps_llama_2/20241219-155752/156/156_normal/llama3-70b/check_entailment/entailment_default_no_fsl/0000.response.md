Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the snake-like movement described in the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the actual number of columns `m` when calculating the current position of Lara. 

In the problem description, Lara moves in a snake-like fashion, first to the right, then up, then to the left, and so on. However, the program does not correctly calculate the column position based on the number of moves `k` and the number of columns `m`. 

For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 7`, the program prints `(3, 2)`, which is correct. However, if `n = 4`, `m = 5`, and `k = 7`, the program still prints `(3, 2)`, which is incorrect because Lara should be in a different column based on the actual number of columns `m`.

The program's calculation `k %= n * 2 - 2` is also incorrect because it does not take into account the actual number of moves in the snake-like pattern, which depends on the number of columns `m`.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should calculate the column position based on the number of moves `k` and the number of columns `m`, and it should also correctly calculate the row position based on the snake-like pattern. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the total number of moves in each snake-like pattern
    moves_per_pattern = 2 * (n - 1)
    # Calculate the number of patterns
    num_patterns = (m - 1) // 2
    # Calculate the remaining moves
    remaining_moves = k % (moves_per_pattern * num_patterns)
    # Calculate the current pattern
    current_pattern = remaining_moves // moves_per_pattern
    # Calculate the moves within the current pattern
    moves_in_pattern = remaining_moves % moves_per_pattern
    # Calculate the column position
    col = current_pattern * 2 + 1 + (moves_in_pattern // (n - 1))
    # Calculate the row position
    row = 1 + (moves_in_pattern % (n - 1))
    if moves_in_pattern % (2 * (n - 1)) > (n - 1):
        row = n - (moves_in_pattern % (n - 1)) - 1
    print(row, col)
```
This implementation correctly calculates the column and row positions based on the number of moves `k` and the number of columns `m`, and it correctly implements the snake-like pattern described in the problem description.
