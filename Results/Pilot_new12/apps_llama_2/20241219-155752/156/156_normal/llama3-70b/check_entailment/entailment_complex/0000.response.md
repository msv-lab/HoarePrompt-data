Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate Lara's position after k moves. The issue lies in the calculation of the position when k is greater than or equal to n - 1 but less than n * 2 - 2. 

In the problem description, Lara moves in a snake-like fashion, first going down all the way to the bottom left corner, then moving to the right, up, to the left, and up again. This pattern continues until she runs out of non-visited cells.

However, the program calculates the position as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which does not accurately represent this snake-like movement.

To correctly calculate the position, we need to take into account the number of rows Lara has completed and the direction she is currently moving. We also need to consider the number of columns and the fact that she moves up and down in a snake-like pattern.

The correct calculation would involve determining the number of complete rows Lara has traversed, the current row, and the current column, taking into account the snake-like movement pattern.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k += 1  # since we are 0-indexed
    # calculate the number of complete rows
    complete_rows = (k - n) // (2 * m - 2)
    # calculate the current row and column
    if k <= n:
        print(k, 1)
    elif k <= n + m - 1:
        print(n, k - n + 1)
    else:
        row = n - (k - (n + m - 1)) % (n - 1) - 1
        col = 2 + (k - (n + m - 1)) // (n - 1)
        # adjust for snake-like movement
        if (k - (n + m - 1)) % (2 * (n - 1)) >= n - 1:
            row = n - row
            col = m - col + 1
        print(row, col)

func()
```
This corrected version takes into account the complete rows, the current row, and the current column, and adjusts for the snake-like movement pattern.
