Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the path described in the problem description. According to the problem description, Lara moves in a snake-like pattern, but the code does not take into account the column number `m` when determining her position.

The issue arises when `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`. In this case, the code prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` as the row and column numbers, respectively. However, this calculation does not accurately reflect Lara's position based on the snake-like pattern described in the problem.

For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 7`, the code prints `3 2` as the row and column numbers, which matches the expected output. However, if `m` were greater than 3, the code would still print the same output, even though Lara should be in a different column.

To correctly determine Lara's position, the code needs to take into account the column number `m` when calculating the row and column numbers. The code should use the modulo operation to determine the column number, and then calculate the row number based on the column number and the value of `k`.

In summary, the code does not correctly implement the snake-like pattern described in the problem description, and it does not take into account the column number `m` when determining Lara's position. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
