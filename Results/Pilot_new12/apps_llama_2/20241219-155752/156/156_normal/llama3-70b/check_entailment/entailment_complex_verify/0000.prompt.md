You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to accurately implement the movement pattern of Lara Croft in the described dungeon. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- It first takes the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` representing the number of rows, columns, and the number of moves made by Lara, respectively.
- It then calculates `k %= n * 2 - 2`, which reduces `k` to its equivalent move within a single cycle of Lara's path. This is because Lara's path repeats every `n * 2 - 2` moves.
- If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means Lara is still moving downwards in the first column. In this case, her position is simply `k + 1` rows down from the top.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, Lara is moving in the snake pattern. The row is calculated as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, which determines the row by finding the remainder of `k - n + 1` divided by `n - 1` and subtracting it from `n - 1`. The column is calculated as `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which increments the column every `n - 1` moves.
- The `else` clause is not actually reachable because of the `%` operation done earlier, but it's not necessary because Lara will always end up in cell `(1, 2)` after completing the full path.
- The program handles cases where `k` is 0 or a multiple of `n * 2 - 2` correctly, as Lara's position is `(1, 1)` at the start of the path.
- The use of integer division `//` and modulo `%` ensures that the calculations are performed correctly for all possible inputs.

Overall, the program seems to accurately implement Lara's movement pattern and calculates her position correctly for all possible inputs. I couldn't find any potential cases where the program doesn't work as expected, so I conclude that it's correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive even and positive integers respectively, such that 2 <= n and 2 <= m, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n * m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, the printed values are `2n - k - 2` and `1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the values `1` and `2` have been printed to the console and `None` has been returned.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer less than `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, `2n - k - 2` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, `1` and `2` have been printed to the console and `None` has been returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer. It then calculates and prints a pair of values based on the input `n` and `k`, after applying the modulo operation `k %= n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `1` and `2`. The function does not explicitly return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`), and the input `m` is not used in the calculation. After execution, the function's state includes the printed pair of values and the modified input `k` value, while the original input values `n`, `m`, and `k` are still present in the program's state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
