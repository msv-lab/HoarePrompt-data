You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly determine Lara's current position in the dungeon after she has moved k times. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The program first takes the input values of n, m, and k, which represent the number of rows, columns, and the number of moves made by Lara, respectively.

2. The program then calculates the remainder of k divided by (n * 2 - 2). This is done to handle cases where k is larger than the total number of moves Lara makes in one complete cycle of her path.

3. If k is less than n - 1, it means Lara has not yet completed her initial downward move. In this case, her position is simply (k + 1, 1), because she has moved k steps down from the starting position (1, 1).

4. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1 but less than n * 2 - 2, Lara has started her "snake-like" movement. The program calculates her row and column positions based on the number of full cycles she has completed and her position within the current cycle.

5. The program handles all potential cases according to the problem description and correctly calculates Lara's position after k moves.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer. It then calculates and prints a pair of values based on the input `n` and `k`, after applying the modulo operation `k %= n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` but less than `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, it prints `1` and `2`. The function does not explicitly return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`), and the input `m` is not used in the calculation. After execution, the function's state includes the printed pair of values and the modified input `k` value, while the original input values `n`, `m`, and `k` are still present in the program's state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
