Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints the state of a path after `k` steps, with the constraints on `n` and `m` ensuring the path ends in cell `(1, 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, the function calculates the `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then prints the `row` and `col` values based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. After the function concludes, it has printed the state of the path after `k` steps, with the final state depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not even or `k` is not a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, as these constraints are assumed to be satisfied by the input values.**
