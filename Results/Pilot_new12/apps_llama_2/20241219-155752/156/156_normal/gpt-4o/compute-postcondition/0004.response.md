To calculate the output state, let's follow the given code and initial conditions step by step.

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. Additionally, it's stated that `n` and `m` are such that the path described always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`, and `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`. 

First, let's address the condition `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`. This implies that `(n - 1)` must be `0` because for any other value of `n`, this equation would not hold true for a non-negative integer `k` without further context on how `k` is adjusted. Since `n` is even and must be a positive integer, if `n - 1 = 0`, then `n` must be `1` to satisfy this condition, but this contradicts the premise that `n` is even unless we are considering a theoretical or adjusted scenario where `n` could momentarily be considered as `1` for this specific condition to be true. However, given `n` is explicitly stated to be even and a positive integer, and considering typical mathematical operations, this specific condition seems to be more of a theoretical adjustment than a practical operation on `k`. 

Thus, focusing on the provided code `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`, we calculate `full_rows` based on the given `k` and `m`. Since `k` equals `k - (n - 1)`, and given `n` must be even and positive, if we were to adjust `k` by this rule, it would imply an operation on `k` that doesn't change its value under normal circumstances unless `n` is specifically defined in a way that makes this adjustment meaningful.

However, since `n` is stated to be even and a positive integer, and given the constraint on `k` and the relation to `n` and `m`, we need to consider the practical implications of `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` without altering the fundamental characteristics of `n`, `m`, and `k` as given.

The calculation of `full_rows` directly depends on `k` and `m`. Given `0 <= k < n*m`, and knowing `n` and `m` are positive integers with `n` being even, `full_rows` will be an integer value representing the result of the floor division of `k` by `m - 1`. 

Since `k` equals `k - (n - 1)`, this suggests a specific scenario or condition rather than a general operation to adjust `k`. Thus, focusing on the division `k // (m - 1)`, we recognize that `full_rows` will be an integer, but its exact value depends on the specific values of `k` and `m`.

Given the constraints and focusing on the code's direct impact:
- `n` remains an even, positive integer.
- `m` remains a positive integer.
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, with the specific condition provided.
- `full_rows` is now an integer value calculated from `k` and `m`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the initial conditions and the direct result of the code, is:
Output State: **`n` is an even, positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m` where `k` equals `k - (n - 1)`, and `full_rows` is an integer equal to `k // (m - 1)`.**
