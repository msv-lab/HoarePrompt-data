Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`, and `n` and `m` are such that the path described always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, then `n` is 1, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, and `row` and `col` have been printed to the output where if `full_rows` is even, then the printed `row` is `1 - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + k % (m - 1)`, and if `full_rows` is odd, then the printed `row` is 0 and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.**
