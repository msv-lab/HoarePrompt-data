The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive integers where `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m. The parameters `n` and `m` are constrained such that the path described always ends up in cell (1, 2). 

However, the problem description does not provide the return values of the function based on the given parameters. To describe the functionality of the function `func_1` accurately, the return values or the specific conditions that determine these return values are necessary.

If we were to follow the format requested for the answer but given the lack of specific return conditions or values in the provided problem, we cannot accurately complete the functionality description as requested. 

But since the task asks for the description in a specific format, and assuming the goal is to outline the parameters and their constraints (with the understanding that the actual return conditions are not specified), the closest adherence to the requested format without specific return conditions would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m, with the constraints on n and m ensuring the path ends in cell (1, 2).**
