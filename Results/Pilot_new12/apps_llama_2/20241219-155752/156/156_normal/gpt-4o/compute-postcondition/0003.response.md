The value of `k` is decreased by `n - 1`. Since `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the new value of `k` is greater than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **n and m are positive integers, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m and n and m are such that the path described always ends up in cell (1, 2), and k is equal to k - (n - 1)**
