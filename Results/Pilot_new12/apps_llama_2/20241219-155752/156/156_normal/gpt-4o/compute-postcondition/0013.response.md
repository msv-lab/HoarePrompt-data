Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we can analyze the impact of the code on the program. 

The code `print(row, col)` will output the current values of `row` and `col` based on the initial state conditions.

Considering the conditions:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`
- If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is `1 - full_rows` (an odd number) and `col` is `2 + k % (m - 1)`
- If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is 0 and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, `row`, and `col` are determined by these conditions. The `print` statement does not alter any variable values but outputs the current state of `row` and `col`.

Therefore, after the `print` statement, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but `row` and `col` have been printed based on the conditions.

The state of all other variables is unchanged as per the initial conditions, and we have printed the `row` and `col` values based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` and `col` have been printed to the output where if `full_rows` is even, then the printed `row` is `1 - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + k % (m - 1)`, and if `full_rows` is odd, then the printed `row` is 0 and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.**
