To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`
- `full_rows` is odd

The code snippet is:
```python
row = n - full_rows
```

Now, let's calculate the value of `row` based on the given initial state.

Since `n` is 1 and `full_rows` is odd, `full_rows` must be at least 1 because it's the smallest odd number. Given that `full_rows` is calculated as `k // (m - 1)` and it's odd, it implies that `k` must be sufficient to produce an odd quotient when divided by `(m - 1)`, considering `k` and `m` are constrained by the initial conditions.

Substituting the value of `n` into the equation for `row`, we get:
```python
row = 1 - full_rows
```

Since `full_rows` is odd and at least 1, `row` will always be even and less than or equal to 0 (because we're subtracting an odd number from 1). Specifically, given that `full_rows` is odd, if `full_rows` is 1, then `row` is 0. For any `full_rows` greater than 1, `row` will be negative.

However, because `full_rows` is calculated from `k // (m - 1)` and must be odd, and considering the constraints on `k` and `m`, we should focus on the fact that `row` is essentially `1 - full_rows`, and since `full_rows` is always at least 1 (given it's odd and `k` and `m` are positive integers with `k` less than `n*m`), `row` will be 0 when `full_rows` is 1.

Given the specific initial conditions and the constraints on the variables, we can conclude that:

- `n` remains 1.
- `m` is still a positive integer.
- `k` is still a non-negative integer less than `n*m`.
- `full_rows` is still `k // (m - 1)` and odd.
- `remaining_steps` is still `k % (m - 1)`.
- `row` is now defined and equals `n - full_rows`, which, given `n` is 1 and `full_rows` is odd, means `row` is even and specifically 0 when `full_rows` is 1, but considering `full_rows` must be at least 1 and is odd, `row` is 0.

Therefore, the output state, considering all variables and their updated values based on the initial conditions and the executed code, is:

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)` and odd, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, and `row` is 0**
