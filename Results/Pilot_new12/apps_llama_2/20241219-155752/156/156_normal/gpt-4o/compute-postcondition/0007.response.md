To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`
- The current value of `full_rows` is an even number, since `full_rows` modulo 2 equals 0.

The code to be executed is:
```python
row = n - full_rows
```

Since `n` is 1 and `full_rows` is an even number, subtracting `full_rows` from `n` will result in an odd number because you're subtracting an even number from an odd number (1 is an odd number).

Therefore, `row` will be an odd number, specifically `1 - full_rows`.

The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, and `remaining_steps` are not affected by this operation.

Hence, the output state is:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)` and is an even number
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`
- `row` is `1 - full_rows`, which is an odd number

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)` and is even, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is `1 - full_rows` and is an odd number**
