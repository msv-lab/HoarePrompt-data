Postcondition: **n and m are positive integers, n is even, and the current value of n is such that it is at least 2 because k < n - 1 implies n is greater than k + 1  and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m. The current value of k is less than n - 1. n and m are such that the path described always ends up in cell (1, 2).**
