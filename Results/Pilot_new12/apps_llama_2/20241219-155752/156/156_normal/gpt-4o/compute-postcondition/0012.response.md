Postcondition: **`n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is `1 - full_rows` (an odd number) and `col` is `2 + k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is 0 and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.**
