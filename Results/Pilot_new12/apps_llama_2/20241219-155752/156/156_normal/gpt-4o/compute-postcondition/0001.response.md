The code prints the value of `k + 1` and `1`. The value of `k` is less than `n - 1`, and `n` is even and at least 2. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not changed by the code. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, `n` is at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`, `k` is less than `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are such that the path described always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`, and the value `k + 1` and `1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, `n` is at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`, `k` is less than `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are such that the path described always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`, and the value `k + 1` and `1` has been printed.**
