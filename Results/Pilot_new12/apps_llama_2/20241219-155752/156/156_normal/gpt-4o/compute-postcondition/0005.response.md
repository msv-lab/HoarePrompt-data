To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an even, positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`.
   - The relationship `k` equals `k - (n - 1)` implies that `n - 1` must be 0, because any other value would result in `k` being reduced to a negative value or a different non-negative value, which contradicts the premise unless `n - 1 = 0`. This means `n` must be 1 to satisfy this condition. However, this seems to conflict with the description of `n` as an even, positive integer greater than 1 (since "even" implies at least 2). Given the constraints, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of `k` equals `k - (n - 1)`. For `k` to remain unchanged under this operation, `n` should indeed be 1 (making `n-1 = 0`), but this contradicts the typical understanding of "even, positive integer" which usually implies `n >= 2`. However, following the strict interpretation that allows `n` to be only 1 (as an even number, 1 is not typically considered even, but for the sake of this analysis), `k` equals `k - (n - 1)` simplifies to `k = k - 0` or simply `k = k`.
   - `full_rows` is an integer equal to `k // (m - 1)`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates `remaining_steps` as `k % (m - 1)`.
   - This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `full_rows`.
   - It introduces a new variable, `remaining_steps`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by `m - 1`.

Given the above analysis and sticking strictly to the format requested:

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, and `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`**
