To determine the output state, we need to calculate the value of `col` based on the given initial state.

Given:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)` and odd
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`
- `row` is 0

The code `col = m - remaining_steps` updates the value of `col` based on `m` and `remaining_steps`.

Since `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, the value of `col` will be `m - (k % (m - 1))`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, and `row` remain the same.

The output state is:
- `n` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)` and odd
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`
- `row` is 0
- `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`

Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)` and odd, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is 0, `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`**
