You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints the state of a path after `k` steps, with the constraints on `n` and `m` ensuring the path ends in cell `(1, 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, the function calculates the `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then prints the `row` and `col` values based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. After the function concludes, it has printed the state of the path after `k` steps, with the final state depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not even or `k` is not a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, as these constraints are assumed to be satisfied by the input values.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
