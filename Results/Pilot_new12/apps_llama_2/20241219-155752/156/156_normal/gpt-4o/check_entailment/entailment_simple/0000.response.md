Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the calculation of the row and column when `k` is not less than `n - 1`. 

In the problem description, Lara moves down to the bottom left corner of the matrix, then starts moving in a snake fashion. The row and column should be calculated based on the number of full rows she has traversed and the remaining steps.

However, in the program, the row and column are calculated as follows:
```python
if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
    row = n - full_rows
    col = 2 + remaining_steps
else :
    row = n - full_rows
    col = m - remaining_steps
```
This is incorrect because the row should be calculated based on the direction of the snake movement (either up or down), not just based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd.

When `full_rows` is even, Lara is moving to the right, so the column should be `1 + remaining_steps`. When `full_rows` is odd, Lara is moving to the left, so the column should be `m - remaining_steps`. The row should be calculated based on the current direction of the snake movement.

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))

# Calculate the position when k is less than n - 1
if (k < n - 1) :
    print(k + 1, 1)

# Calculate the position when k is not less than n - 1
else :
    k -= n - 1
    full_rows = k // (2 * (m - 1))
    remaining_steps = k % (2 * (m - 1))
    
    # Calculate the row and column based on the direction of the snake movement
    if (remaining_steps < m - 1) :
        row = n - full_rows * 2 - 1
        col = 1 + remaining_steps
    else :
        row = n - full_rows * 2
        col = m - (remaining_steps - (m - 1)) - 1

    print(row, col)
```
This corrected implementation calculates the position of Lara based on the problem description. When `k` is less than `n - 1`, it correctly calculates the position. When `k` is not less than `n - 1`, it calculates the position based on the number of full rows traversed and the remaining steps, taking into account the direction of the snake movement.
