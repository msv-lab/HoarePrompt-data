Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly determine the position of Lara after `k` steps in the given 2D matrix. It first checks if Lara is still moving down in the first column. If not, it calculates the number of full rows she has traversed and the remaining steps she has taken, and uses this information to determine her current row and column.

The program correctly handles the constraints on `n` and `m`, and it correctly implements the snake-like movement pattern described in the problem. The output hints and the provided examples also agree with the code.

The code correctly handles the case where `k` is less than `n - 1`, in which case it simply prints `k + 1` and `1`. For larger values of `k`, it correctly calculates the `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and uses this information to determine the current row and column.

The program assumes that the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` are valid, which means `n` is even, `m` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`. Given these assumptions, the program seems to work correctly for all possible input values.

The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the program, which further supports the conclusion that the program is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for every potential case.
