You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is equal to `n * m - 1`. In this case, Lara should end up in cell `(1, 2)`, but the program calculates the row and column incorrectly.

To see why, let's analyze the program's logic. When `k >= n - 1`, the program subtracts `n - 1` from `k` and then calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps. However, when `k` is equal to `n * m - 1`, the program calculates `k -= n - 1` as `k = n * m - n`, and then `full_rows = (n * m - n) // (m - 1)` and `remaining_steps = (n * m - n) % (m - 1)`.

Since `n` is even and `m` is at least 2, `n * m - n` is always a multiple of `m - 1`, so `remaining_steps` is always 0. As a result, when `full_rows % 2 == 0`, the program calculates `row = n - full_rows` as `row = 1` and `col = 2 + remaining_steps` as `col = 2`, which is correct. However, when `full_rows % 2 == 1`, the program calculates `row = n - full_rows` as `row = 1` and `col = m - remaining_steps` as `col = m`, which is incorrect because Lara should end up in cell `(1, 2)`, not `(1, m)`.

To fix this bug, the program should handle the case when `k` is equal to `n * m - 1` separately. Here's an example of how to do it:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k == n * m - 1:
        print(1, 2)
    elif k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)

func_1(n, m, k)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints the state of a path after `k` steps, with the constraints on `n` and `m` ensuring the path ends in cell `(1, 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, the function calculates the `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then prints the `row` and `col` values based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. After the function concludes, it has printed the state of the path after `k` steps, with the final state depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not even or `k` is not a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, as these constraints are assumed to be satisfied by the input values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
