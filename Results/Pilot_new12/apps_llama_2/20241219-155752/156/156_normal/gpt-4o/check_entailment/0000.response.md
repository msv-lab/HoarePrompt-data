Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly determine Lara's current position after she moves k times in the given dungeon matrix.

The function `func_1(n, m, k)` properly handles the movement of Lara. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means Lara is still moving down the leftmost column, so the function correctly prints the current row as `k + 1` and the column as `1`.

If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function calculates the number of full rows that Lara has moved through, as well as the remaining steps she needs to take in the current row. Depending on whether the number of full rows is even or odd, the function correctly determines the current row and column.

The use of the modulo operator to calculate the remaining steps ensures that the function handles cases where `k` is not a multiple of `m - 1`. Additionally, the function's handling of even and odd numbers of full rows ensures that it correctly alternates between moving right and moving left in the snake-like pattern.

I have not found any cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided examples in the problem description also seem to be correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I believe that the program is correct for all potential cases.
