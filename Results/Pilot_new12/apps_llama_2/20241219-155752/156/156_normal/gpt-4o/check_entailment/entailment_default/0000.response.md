Correctness: **True**

The code appears to accurately implement the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly handles the initial movement of Lara down the first column and then calculates her position based on the remaining steps and the snake-like pattern. The function distinguishes between even and odd full rows and determines the correct row and column based on the parity of `full_rows`.

The output hints align with the code and provide insight into the function's operation. They confirm that the function handles cases where `k` is less than `n-1` and where it is not, and that it correctly calculates the row and column based on `full_rows` and `remaining_steps`.

Furthermore, the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code:

- For `n=4`, `m=3`, and `k=0`, the code correctly prints `1 1`.
- For `n=4`, `m=3`, and `k=11`, the code correctly prints `1 2`.
- For `n=4`, `m=3`, and `k=7`, the code correctly prints `3 2`.

Given the constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` (i.e., `n` is even, `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`, and `0 <= k < n*m`), the code should work as expected for all valid inputs.
