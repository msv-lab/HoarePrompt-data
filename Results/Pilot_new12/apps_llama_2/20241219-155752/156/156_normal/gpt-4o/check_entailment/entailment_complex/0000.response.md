Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. 

The program first checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`. If this condition is met, it means that Lara is still moving down the first column, so the program prints `k + 1` and `1`.

If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, the program calculates the number of full rows that Lara has completed (`full_rows = k // (m - 1)`) and the remaining steps (`remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`).

The program then checks if `full_rows` is even or odd. If `full_rows` is even, it means that Lara is moving to the right, so the program prints `n - full_rows` and `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, it means that Lara is moving to the left, so the program prints `n - full_rows` and `m - remaining_steps`.

This logic accurately follows the problem description, which states that Lara moves down the first column, then moves in a snake-like pattern to the right and left. The program correctly calculates Lara's position after `k` steps, taking into account the number of full rows completed and the remaining steps.

The program also handles the case where `n` and `m` are such that the path described always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`, as stated in the problem description.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem description, and it correctly calculates Lara's position after `k` steps. Therefore, the program is correct.
