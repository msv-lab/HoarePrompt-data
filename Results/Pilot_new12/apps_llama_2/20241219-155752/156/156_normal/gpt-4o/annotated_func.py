#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m and n and m are such that the path described always ends up in cell (1, 2).
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is `1 - full_rows` (an odd number) and `col` is `2 + k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is 0 and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`, and `n` and `m` are such that the path described always ends up in cell `(1, 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, then `n` is 1, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, and `row` and `col` have been printed to the output where if `full_rows` is even, then the printed `row` is `1 - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + k % (m - 1)`, and if `full_rows` is odd, then the printed `row` is 0 and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints the state of a path after `k` steps, with the constraints on `n` and `m` ensuring the path ends in cell `(1, 2)`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function prints `k + 1` and `1`. If `k` is not less than `n - 1`, the function calculates the `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then prints the `row` and `col` values based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. After the function concludes, it has printed the state of the path after `k` steps, with the final state depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `m`, or `k`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not even or `k` is not a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, as these constraints are assumed to be satisfied by the input values.
