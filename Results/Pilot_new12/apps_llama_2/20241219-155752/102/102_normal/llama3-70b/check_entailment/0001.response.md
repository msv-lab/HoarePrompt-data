Correctness: **True**

The program works correctly for all potential cases. It iterates over all possible non-negative integer numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) that Vasya can buy, and for each `x`, it calculates the maximum number of Bars bars (`y`) that Vasya can buy with the remaining money. If it finds a combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y`. If it doesn't find any such combination after checking all possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `x` or `y` is 0, and when `n` is a multiple of `a` or `b`. It also works correctly for large inputs, as it only iterates up to `n // a`, which is a reasonable limit.

The examples provided in the problem description are all handled correctly by the program. For instance, in the first example, the program finds that Vasya can buy 2 bottles of Ber-Cola and 1 Bars bar to spend exactly 7 burles, and it prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y` accordingly.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
