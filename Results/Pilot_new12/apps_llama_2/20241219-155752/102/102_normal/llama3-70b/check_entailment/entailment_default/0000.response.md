Correctness: **True**

The code correctly determines whether it is possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars to spend exactly n burles. It iterates through all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola, calculates the remaining amount of burles, and checks if it is possible to buy an integer number of Bars bars to spend the remaining amount. If such a combination is found, it prints 'YES' and the corresponding numbers of bottles and bars to buy. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

The code handles all possible cases correctly, including when it is not possible to buy an integer number of Bars bars to spend the remaining amount, as seen in the example with inputs 7, 2, and 3, where it correctly outputs 'YES' and the corresponding numbers of bottles and bars to buy. It also handles cases where there are multiple possible combinations, as seen in the example with inputs 100, 25, and 10, where it correctly outputs 'YES' and one of the possible combinations.

Additionally, the code correctly handles cases where it is not possible to spend exactly n burles, as seen in the example with inputs 15, 4, and 8, where it correctly outputs 'NO'.

The provided output hints agree with the code, indicating that it correctly checks for integer solutions within the specified constraints and prints the result directly to the console.

The code also handles large inputs correctly, as seen in the example with inputs 9960594, 2551, and 2557, where it correctly outputs 'YES' and the corresponding numbers of bottles and bars to buy.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
