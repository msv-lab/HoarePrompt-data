Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description by finding two non-negative integers x and y such that x * a + y * b = n. The function iterates over all possible values of x (from 0 to n // a) and calculates the corresponding value of y such that x * a + y * b = n. If it finds a pair (x, y) that satisfies the equation, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of x and y. If no such pair is found after checking all possible values of x, it prints 'NO'.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem description, including the examples provided. It correctly handles cases where there are multiple solutions, as well as cases where no solution exists.

The code assumes that the input will be valid, as stated in the problem description. It does not contain any error handling for invalid input, but this is acceptable given the assumption that the input will always be valid.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality, and do not indicate any cases where the code does not work correctly. Overall, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
