Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1.  The program takes three inputs: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the amount of money Vasya has, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar, respectively.
2.  The program iterates over all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to `n // a`. For each `x`, it calculates the corresponding `y` (the number of Bars bars) as `(n - x * a) // b`.
3.  If it finds a pair `(x, y)` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and exits the program.
4.  If the program completes the loop without finding a solution, it prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles on Ber-Cola and Bars bars.

The program is correct because it exhaustively searches all possible combinations of `x` and `y` within the given constraints and checks if the total cost equals `n`. If a solution is found, it's printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

Here are some key points that demonstrate the program's correctness:

*   The loop iterates over all possible values of `x` up to `n // a`, ensuring that all potential solutions are considered.
*   For each `x`, the corresponding `y` is calculated based on the remaining amount of money (`n - x * a`) and the cost of one Bars bar (`b`). This ensures that the total cost (`x * a + y * b`) is always compared to `n`.
*   The program checks for exact equality (`x * a + y * b == n`) to determine if a solution is found.

Overall, the program's logic and implementation align with the problem description, making it a correct solution to the problem.
