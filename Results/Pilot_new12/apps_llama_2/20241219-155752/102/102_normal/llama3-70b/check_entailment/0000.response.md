Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by trying all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars. It iterates over all possible numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (from 0 to n // a), calculates the number of Bars bars that can be bought with the remaining money, and checks if the total cost equals n.

The program uses a greedy approach, which is sufficient in this case because the problem only asks for any valid combination of x and y, not the optimal one. The use of integer division (//) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of bottles and bars.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:

* If n is 0, the program will print 'YES' and output (0, 0), which is correct.
* If a or b is greater than n, the program will print 'NO', which is correct.
* If there are multiple valid combinations of x and y, the program will print the first one it finds, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Overall, the program is correct and should work for all possible inputs.
