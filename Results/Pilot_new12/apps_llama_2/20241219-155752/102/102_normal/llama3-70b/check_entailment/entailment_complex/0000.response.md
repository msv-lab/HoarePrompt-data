Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads three integers from standard input: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which represent the amount of money Vasya has, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar, respectively.

2. The program then checks all possible non-negative integer combinations of `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. This is done using a `for` loop that iterates over all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`, where `//` denotes integer division.

3. For each value of `x`, the program calculates the corresponding value of `y` such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, if possible. This is done by calculating `y = (n - x * a) // b`.

4. If the program finds a combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and then exits the program.

5. If the program exhausts all possible combinations of `x` and `y` without finding a solution, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly `n` burles.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

- When there is a unique solution: The program will find and print the solution.
- When there are multiple solutions: The program will find and print one of the solutions.
- When there is no solution: The program will print 'NO'.

The program assumes that the input will be valid, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it does not include any error checking or handling for invalid input.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
