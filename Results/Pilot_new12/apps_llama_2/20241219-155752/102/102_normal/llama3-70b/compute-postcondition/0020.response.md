The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately, so no further calculations are performed. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed. The program ends without returning any value. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is an incremental value plus 1, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, the values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has ended without returning a value**
