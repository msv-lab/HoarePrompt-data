Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `y` is `n // b`. If there exists an integer `x` such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed, the values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
