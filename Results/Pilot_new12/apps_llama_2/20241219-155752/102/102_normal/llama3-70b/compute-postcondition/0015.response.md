Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is an incremental value. If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed, the current values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has been terminated. If `x * a + y * b` does not equal `n`, then no additional information is provided about the state of the program.***
