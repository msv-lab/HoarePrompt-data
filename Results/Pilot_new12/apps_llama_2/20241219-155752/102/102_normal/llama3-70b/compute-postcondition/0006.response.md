The provided code snippet simply prints 'YES' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The states of these variables are still the same as in the initial state.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is a value such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, `y` is `n // b`, and the equation `x * a + y * b` equals `n` still holds, 'YES' has been printed**
