Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, the initial value of `x` is 0, the initial value of `y` is `n // b`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`**
