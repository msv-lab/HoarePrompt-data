The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y` but does not change them. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers where `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is non-zero, and `b` has no restrictions. `x` is an incremental value plus 1, and `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`. The string 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is an incremental value plus 1, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed**
