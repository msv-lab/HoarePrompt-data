The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of an input integer to the variable `n`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not affected, and they remain integers between 1 and 10,000,000. The value of `n` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10,000,000**
