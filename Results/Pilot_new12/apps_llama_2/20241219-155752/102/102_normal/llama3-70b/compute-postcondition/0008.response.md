The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops executing. 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed. The equation `x * a + y * b` equals `n` still holds. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is a value such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, `y` is `n // b`, 'YES' has been printed, the values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has been terminated.**
