The code `b = int(input())` assigns the value of an input integer to `b`. The previous value of `b` is overridden. The input integer is converted to an integer using `int()`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

The initial state specified that `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10,000,000, but this constraint is no longer guaranteed after the code is executed, as the new value of `b` can be any integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
