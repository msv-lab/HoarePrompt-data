The value of `a` is updated to be an input integer. The previous range of `a` (1 <= `a` <= 10,000,000) is no longer valid as `a` can now be any input integer. The values of `n` and `b` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10,000,000**
