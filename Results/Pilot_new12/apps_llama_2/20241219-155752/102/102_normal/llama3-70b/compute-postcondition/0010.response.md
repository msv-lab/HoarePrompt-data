According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `n`, and `a`. If `x` is less than `n // a + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current value, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is non-zero, `b` is an integer, `y` is `n // b`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1. 

Since 'YES' has been printed and the program terminated if there exists an integer `x` such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, it means that at the end of the previous iteration, no such `x` has been found. Therefore, the program state remains unchanged in terms of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `y`. Only `x` needs to be incremented.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `y` is `n // b`, `x` is the current value of `x` plus 1**
