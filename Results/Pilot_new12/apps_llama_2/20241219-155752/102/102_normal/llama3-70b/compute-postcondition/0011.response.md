To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0,
- `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero,
- `b` is an input integer,
- `y` is initially `n // b`,
- `x` is the current value of `x` plus 1.

The code to execute is:
```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

This code updates the value of `y` based on the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`.

Since `x` is defined as the current value of `x` plus 1, but we don't have an initial value for `x`, we cannot determine a specific numeric value for `x`. However, we can express `x` in terms of its previous value, but since the initial state does not specify a concrete value for `x`, we treat `x` as it is, understanding it's an incremental value without a specified starting point.

After executing the code, the value of `y` changes to `(n - x * a) // b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is still incremental, based on its definition, but its exact value or how it increments is not specified in the initial state or modified by the given code, so we focus on the change in `y`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the given initial state and the executed code, is:
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0,
- `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero,
- `b` is an input integer,
- `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`,
- `x` remains as defined, an incremental value without a specified starting point.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is an incremental value**
