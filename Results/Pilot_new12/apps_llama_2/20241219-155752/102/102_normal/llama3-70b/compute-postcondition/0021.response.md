Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is an incremental value plus 1, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, if `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `x` and `y`, and the program has ended without returning a value***
