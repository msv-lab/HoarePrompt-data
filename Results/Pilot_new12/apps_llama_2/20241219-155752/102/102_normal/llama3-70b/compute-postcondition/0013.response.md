The given code snippet prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is an incremental value and `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, their values are printed, but their actual values are not changed by the print statement. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed before this statement and the integer division `(n - x * a) // b` may result in a different value based on the current value of `x`. 
The `x` and `y` values have been printed but the output state remains the same for other variables. `n` is still an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is still an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is still an input integer, and `y` is still `(n - x * a) // b`. `x` is still an incremental value. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is an incremental value, 'YES' has been printed and the current values of `x` and `y` have been printed**
