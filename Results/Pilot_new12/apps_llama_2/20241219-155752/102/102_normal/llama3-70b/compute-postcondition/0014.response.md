The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution stops. 'YES' has been printed and the current values of `x` and `y` have been printed before the program exited. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, `x` is an incremental value, 'YES' has been printed, the current values of `x` and `y` have been printed, and the program has been terminated**
