To calculate the output state, let's first analyze the initial state and the given Python code.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `x` is an incremental value plus 1.
- `y` is `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

Now, let's calculate the output state:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged for the same reason.
- The value of `b` also remains unchanged.
- The value of `x` does not change in the given code snippet.
- The value of `y` is updated to `(n - x * a) // b`.

Given the initial definition of `y` as `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b` and its updated value as `(n - x * a) // b`, we see that the only variable directly affected by the code is `y`. The new value of `y` is calculated using `n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`, but the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `b` themselves do not change.

Thus, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `x` is an incremental value plus 1.
- `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, which is the updated formula.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is an incremental value plus 1, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`**
