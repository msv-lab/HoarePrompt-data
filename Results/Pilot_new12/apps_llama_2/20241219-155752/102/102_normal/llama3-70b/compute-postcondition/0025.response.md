Functionality: **The function determines whether it is possible to express a given integer `n` as a linear combination of two other integers `a` and `b`, both ranging from 1 to 10,000,000, with non-negative integer coefficients. It takes no parameters but reads three integers from standard input: `n`, `a`, and `b`. If such a combination exists, it outputs 'YES' followed by the coefficients `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b = n`. If no such combination is found, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but instead prints the result directly to the console, effectively terminating the program upon finding a solution or exhausting all possibilities. The function's primary action is to check for integer solutions within the specified constraints, and its final state is either having printed a solution and exited or having indicated that no solution exists.**
