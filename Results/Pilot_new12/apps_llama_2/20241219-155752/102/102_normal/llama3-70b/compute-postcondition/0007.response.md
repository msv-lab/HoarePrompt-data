The code `print(x, y)` prints the current values of `x` and `y`. The values of the variables do not change, but the current values of `x` and `y` are printed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is a value such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, `y` is `n // b`, the equation `x * a + y * b` equals `n` still holds, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is a value such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, `y` is `n // b`, the equation `x * a + y * b` equals `n` still holds, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.**
