The given code calculates the value of `y` using the formula `y = (n - x * a) // b`. 

Given that `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, and `x` is 0, 

we can substitute `x` = 0 into the equation, which results in `y = (n - 0 * a) // b` = `n // b`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer that must be non-zero, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`**
