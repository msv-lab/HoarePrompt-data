The function accepts no parameters and reads three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user. It checks if `n` can be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b` (i.e., `n = ax + by` for some integers `x` and `y`) by iterating over possible values of `x`. If such a combination is found, it prints 'YES' along with the corresponding values of `x` and `y`, and then returns without any explicit return value (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`). If no such combination is found after checking all possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO' and returns without any explicit return value (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`). The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or non-positive inputs, or cases where `a` or `b` is zero, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
