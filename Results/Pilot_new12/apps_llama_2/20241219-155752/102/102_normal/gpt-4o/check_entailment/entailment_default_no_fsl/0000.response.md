Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a solution to the problem of finding two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and spend exactly n burles. The problem can be expressed as a linear Diophantine equation: n = ax + by.

The code checks all possible combinations of x and y, where x is the number of bottles of Ber-Cola and y is the number of Bars bars. It iterates over all possible values of x, calculates the corresponding value of y, and checks if y is a non-negative integer.

The code works as follows:

- It takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` as input from the user.
- It checks all possible values of `x` in the range from 0 to `n // a` (inclusive).
- For each value of `x`, it calculates the corresponding value of `y` using the equation `y = (n - x * a) // b`.
- If `y` is a non-negative integer, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and returns.
- If no combination of `x` and `y` is found after checking all possible values of `x`, it prints 'NO' and returns.

The code correctly handles all possible cases, including cases where there are multiple solutions, and cases where there are no solutions. The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality, and the code passes all the provided examples. 

Given the problem constraints, the code assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`), and it does not handle cases where the input is not valid. However, according to the problem statement, we can assume that the input will always be valid. 

Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case, and it produces the expected output for the given examples.
