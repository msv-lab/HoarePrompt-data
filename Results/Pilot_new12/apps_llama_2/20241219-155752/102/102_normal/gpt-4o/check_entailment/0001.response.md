Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The program iterates over all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (number of bottles of Ber-Cola) and checks if there exists a corresponding non-negative integer `y` (number of Bars bars) such that `x * a + y * b = n`. If it finds such a pair, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If it exhausts all possible values of `x` without finding a matching pair, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all edge cases, including:

* When `n` is a multiple of `a` or `b`, the program will find a solution with `x` or `y` equal to 0, respectively.
* When `n` is not a multiple of `a` or `b`, the program will correctly determine if a solution exists or not.
* When `a` or `b` is greater than `n`, the program will only consider values of `x` up to `n // a`, which ensures that the loop does not exceed the valid range.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, and there are no apparent edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
