Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes in three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, which corresponds to the amount of money Vasya has, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar, respectively.

2. **Logic Implementation**: It iterates over all possible non-negative integers `x` of bottles of Ber-Cola that Vasya can afford, given his budget `n` and the cost `a` of one bottle. For each `x`, it checks if the remaining budget `n - x * a` can be exactly spent on Bars bars (i.e., if `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, the cost of one Bars bar).

3. **Output Generation**: If it finds an `x` for which the remaining budget is a multiple of `b`, it calculates the corresponding number of Bars bars `y` that Vasya should buy (`y = (n - x * a) // b`) and prints out 'YES' followed by `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b = n`, this is a valid solution according to the problem description.

4. **Handling No Solution**: If the program iterates over all possible values of `x` without finding a suitable solution, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's impossible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles on the given items, which aligns with the problem description.

The program's logic ensures that it will find a solution if one exists within the bounds of the problem description, and it will correctly identify cases where no such solution exists. Therefore, it accurately implements the problem description for all potential cases.
