Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1. If `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, the program returns None. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged as no operations are performed in the else part, maintaining the initial conditions of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x`, with the additional condition that `(n - x * a) % b` is not equal to 0 still holding true.**
