To determine the output state, let's consider the given code and initial conditions.

The initial state is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, where 1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10 000 000.

The code provided is:
```python
n = int(input())
```
This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer using `int()`, and assigns this integer value to `n`.

Given that `n` was initially a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000,000, after executing this code, `n` will be updated to whatever positive integer value the user inputs. However, there's no restriction in the code itself that enforces the input to be within the 1 to 10,000,000 range; it only depends on the user's input. Since the input is expected to be an integer and the initial condition specified `n`, `a`, and `b` as positive integers within a certain range, and the code does not restrict the input range, we consider `n` to take any positive integer value based on the user's input.

The states of `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code, so they remain as they were initially described: positive integers within the range 1 to 10,000,000.

Therefore, the output state, considering the code's effect and the initial conditions, is:
Output State: **`n` is a user-input positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, where 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10,000,000.**
