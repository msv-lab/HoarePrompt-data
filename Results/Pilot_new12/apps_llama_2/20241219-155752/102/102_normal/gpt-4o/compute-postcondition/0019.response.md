The code prints the values of `x` and `y` to the console. The value of `x` is 2, and the value of `y` is `(n - 2 * a)` // `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed to the console and now `x` and `y` have also been printed. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `(n - 2 * a)` % `b` is not equal to 0, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - 2 * a)` // `b`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `x` and `y` have been printed to the console.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `(n - 2 * a)` % `b` is not equal to 0, `y` is `(n - 2 * a)` // `b`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `x = 2` and `y = (n - 2 * a)` // `b` have been printed to the console.**
