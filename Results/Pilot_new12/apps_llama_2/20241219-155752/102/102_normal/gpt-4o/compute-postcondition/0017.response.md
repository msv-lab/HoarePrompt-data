To calculate the output state, we first look at the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer, 
- `a` is a non-zero integer, 
- `b` is an integer, 
- `x` is 2, and 
- `(n - 2 * a)` % `b` is not equal to 0.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

Given `x` is 2, we substitute `x` in the equation:
```python
y = (n - 2 * a) // b
```
Since `(n - 2 * a)` % `b` is not equal to 0, `(n - 2 * a)` is not perfectly divisible by `b`. Therefore, the result of `(n - 2 * a)` // `b` will be the quotient of the division, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number, but the specific value of this quotient is not directly determinable without knowing the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, we can say that `y` will be an integer because it's the result of a floor division (`//`) operation.

Considering the initial state and the operation performed:
- `n` remains a positive integer,
- `a` remains a non-zero integer,
- `b` remains an integer,
- `x` remains 2,
- `(n - 2 * a)` % `b` is not equal to 0, and
- `y` is assigned the value of the quotient of `(n - 2 * a)` divided by `b`, which is an integer but its exact value depends on `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `(n - 2 * a)` % `b` is not equal to 0, and `y` is an integer equal to `(n - 2 * a)` // `b`.**
