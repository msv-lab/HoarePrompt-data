The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is 1, and the value of `y` is `(n - a) // b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed before this, so it is still printed. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and `(1, (n - a) // b)` has been printed.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, `y` is `(n - a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and `(1, (n - a) // b)` has been printed**
