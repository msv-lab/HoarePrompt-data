Given that `x` is 0, the expression `(n - x * a)` simplifies to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and the current value of `n` minus the product of `x` and `a` is a multiple of `b` (which simplifies to `n % b == 0`), we can conclude that `n` is a multiple of `b`.

The code `y = (n - x * a) // b` assigns the value of `n // b` to `y`, since `x` is 0.

So, `y` is assigned the value of `n // b`, which is the integer division of `n` by `b`, and since `n` is a multiple of `b`, `y` will be an integer representing how many times `b` fits into `n`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `x`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and a multiple of `b`, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is an integer equal to `n // b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of `b`, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`**
