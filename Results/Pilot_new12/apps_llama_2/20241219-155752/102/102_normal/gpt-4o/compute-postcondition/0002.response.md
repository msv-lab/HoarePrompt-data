The code reassigns the value of `b` to be an integer input by the user. The previous value of `b` as a positive integer where 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000 is no longer valid. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a user-input positive integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
