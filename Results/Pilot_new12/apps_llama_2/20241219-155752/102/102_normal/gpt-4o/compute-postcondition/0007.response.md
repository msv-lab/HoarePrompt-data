The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is 0 and the value of `y` is `n // b`. Since `n` is a multiple of `b`, `n // b` is an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed before this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and a multiple of `b`, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `x` and `y` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of `b`, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and (0, `n // b`) has been printed**
