To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given code does. The code calculates the value of `y` using the expression `(n - x * a) // b`, where `//` denotes integer division, which discards the fractional part and returns the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `a` is a non-zero integer,
- `b` is an integer,
- `x` is 1, and
- ((n - x * a) % b) is not equal to 0, implying that `(n - x * a)` is not a multiple of `b`.

The calculation of `y` is as follows:
`y = (n - x * a) // b`

Since `x` is 1, we can simplify this to:
`y = (n - a) // b`

Given that `n` is positive, `a` is non-zero, and `b` is an integer, the value of `(n - a)` can vary, but since `x` is 1 and `a` is non-zero, `(n - a)` will be an integer. The division by `b` then depends on the values of `(n - a)` and `b`. However, we know that `((n - x * a) % b)` is not equal to 0, meaning that `(n - a)` is not a multiple of `b`. This implies that the result of `(n - a) // b` will be the integer part of the division, with a non-zero remainder.

The states of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are not changed by this operation, as only `y` is assigned a new value.

Therefore, the output state, considering all given conditions and the effect of the code, is:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `a` is a non-zero integer,
- `b` is an integer,
- `x` is 1, and
- `y` is the integer part of the result of `(n - a)` divided by `b`, with the condition that `(n - a)` is not a multiple of `b` still holding, which implies that `y` will be an integer but `(n - a)` will have a non-zero remainder when divided by `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 1, and `y` is `(n - a) // b`**
