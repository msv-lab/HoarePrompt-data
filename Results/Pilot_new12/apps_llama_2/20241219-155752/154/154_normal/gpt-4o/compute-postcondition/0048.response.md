To calculate the output state, we first need to determine the value of `remaining_time`. However, `remaining_time` is not directly provided in the initial state. We can infer that `remaining_time` would be `M - time_used` since `time_used` is the time already utilized and `M` is the original total available time.

Given that `time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, we can express `remaining_time` as `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.

The code then calculates `max_subtasks_for_this_task` as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Since `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`, we know its value is `t[2]`.

Thus, `max_subtasks_for_this_task = (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`.

The initial state provides that:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`.
- `M` is the original total available time.
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` with at least 3 elements.
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`.
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`.
- `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`.
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
- `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`, so `subtask_time = t[2]`.
- `subtask_index` is 2.

After executing the given code, the only variable that changes value is `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which becomes `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`.
- `M` is the original total available time.
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` with at least 3 elements.
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`.
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`.
- `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`.
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
- `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`, so `subtask_time = t[2]`.
- `subtask_index` is 2.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`.
