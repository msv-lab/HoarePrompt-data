Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the first element in the list `t`, `subtask_index` is 0, and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % (first element in the list `t`))`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // (first element in the list `t`)`.***
