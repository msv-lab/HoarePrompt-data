To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is the original total available time
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 2 elements
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`
- `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`
- `subtask_index` is 1
- `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % (second element in the list `t`))`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`
- `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + remaining_time // subtask_time`

The code provided is:
```python
remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
```

This code decreases the `remaining_time` by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. 

Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, the updated `remaining_time` can be calculated as follows:

`remaining_time` becomes `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

This operation effectively reduces `remaining_time` by the largest multiple of `subtask_time` that is less than or equal to `remaining_time`, leaving a remainder that is less than `subtask_time`.

The other variables' states remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is the original total available time
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 2 elements
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`
- `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`
- `subtask_index` is 1
- `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time` before the reduction
- `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + remaining_time // subtask_time` before the reduction

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`, `subtask_index` is 1, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time) - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time` where `remaining_time` on the right-hand side is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time)) // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time)) // subtask_time`**
