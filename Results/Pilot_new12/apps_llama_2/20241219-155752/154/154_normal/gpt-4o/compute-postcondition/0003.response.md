The code `time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` assigns the value of `complete_tasks` times `total_time_per_task` to `time_used`. Given the initial state, `complete_tasks` is `0` and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, which means `time_used` will be `0` because any number multiplied by `0` is `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is `0`, `complete_tasks` is `0`, and `time_used` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, `max_points` is `0`, `complete_tasks` is `0`, and `time_used` is `0`**
