To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is the original total available time
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtask_time` is the second task in the list `t`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals the floor of `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / t[1]`

The code increments `subtasks_solved` by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is determined by the available time `M`, the time used by completed tasks `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, and the time required for each subtask `t[1]`.

Since `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is calculated based on the remaining time and the time required for each subtask, the new value of `subtasks_solved` becomes `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

The states of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, and `subtask_time` are not directly affected by this operation. However, the increase in `subtasks_solved` might indirectly affect future calculations involving these variables, but based on the provided initial state and the specific code snippet, we only update `subtasks_solved`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the second task in the list `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals the floor of `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / t[1]`, and `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
