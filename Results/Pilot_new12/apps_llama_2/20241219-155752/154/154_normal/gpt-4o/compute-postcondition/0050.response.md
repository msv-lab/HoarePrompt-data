The value of `remaining_time` is decreased by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]` and `subtask_time` is `t[2]`. Therefore, `remaining_time` becomes `remaining_time - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]) * t[2]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is the original total available time, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` with at least 3 elements, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, 
`complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, 
`time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtask_time` is `t[2]`, 
`subtask_index` is 2, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`, 
`subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`, 
`remaining_time` is `remaining_time - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]) * t[2]`.
