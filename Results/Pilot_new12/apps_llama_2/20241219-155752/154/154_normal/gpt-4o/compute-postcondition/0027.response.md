The code updates the value of `subtasks_solved` to be the minimum between its current value and the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is the original total available time, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points`, `max_points`, and `complete_tasks` are updated based on external conditions, 
`subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, 
`remaining_time` is the original `M` minus the total time used for all completed subtasks, 
and `time_used` is the total time spent on subtasks.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points`, `max_points`, and `complete_tasks` are updated based on external conditions, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the original `M` minus the total time used for all completed subtasks, and `time_used` is the total time spent on subtasks**
