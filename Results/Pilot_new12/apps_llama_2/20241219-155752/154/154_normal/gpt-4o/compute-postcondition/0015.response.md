Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `time_used` has increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_points` is `0`, `complete_tasks` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` would need to be recalculated based on the new `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is also subject to recalculation based on the updated `remaining_time`.***
