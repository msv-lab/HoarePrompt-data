The code sets `subtasks_solved` to 0. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
