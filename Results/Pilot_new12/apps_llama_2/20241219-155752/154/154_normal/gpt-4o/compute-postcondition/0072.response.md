Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the second task in the list `t`, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * t[1]`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals the floor of `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) / t[1]`, and `subtasks_solved` is updated accordingly; otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` retaining their previous values.**
