The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `t` and assigns it to the variable `total_time_per_task`. 

Given that `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, and `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, the sum `total_time_per_task` will be a non-negative integer.

The minimum possible value for `total_time_per_task` would be `0` if all elements in `t` are `0`, but since `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000`, the minimum value will be `k` (when all `t[i]` are `1`). The maximum possible value for `total_time_per_task` would be `k * 1000000`.

Given that `1 <= k <= 45`, the maximum possible value for `total_time_per_task` would be `45 * 1000000 = 45000000`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` are not changed by this code, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, and `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to the sum of all elements in `t`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, and `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`**
