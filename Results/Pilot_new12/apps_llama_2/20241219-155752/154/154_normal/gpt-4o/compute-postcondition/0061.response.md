The code `subtasks_solved = 0` sets the value of `subtasks_solved` to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
