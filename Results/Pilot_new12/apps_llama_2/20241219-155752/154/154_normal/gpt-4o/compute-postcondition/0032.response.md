Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` remains the same, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `remaining_time` is the original `M` minus the total time used for all completed subtasks, and `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; if `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise the execution continues with the updated values.**
