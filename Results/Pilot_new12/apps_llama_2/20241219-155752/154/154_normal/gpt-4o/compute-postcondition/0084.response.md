Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the maximum achievable points that can be obtained by completing tasks and their subtasks within a given time limit M. It takes four parameters: n (the total number of tasks), k (the number of subtasks for each task), M (the total available time), and t (a list of time required for each subtask in each task). The function considers all possible combinations of completing tasks and their subtasks, calculates the points achieved in each case, and returns the maximum points achievable. The points are calculated based on the number of tasks completed and their subtasks solved within the given time limit. The function handles edge cases where the time used exceeds the available time M, and it ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining tasks. After execution, the function returns the maximum achievable points, providing a solution to the task and subtask allocation problem within the given time constraint.**
