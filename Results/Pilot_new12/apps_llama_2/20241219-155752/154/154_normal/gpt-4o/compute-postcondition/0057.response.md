The `break` statement only exits the loop it is directly inside, and does not affect any variable values. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is as per its initial or externally updated values, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is incremented by 1, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
