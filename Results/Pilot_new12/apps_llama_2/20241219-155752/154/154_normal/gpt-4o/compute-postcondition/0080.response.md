The value of `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The previous value of `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, and `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The value of `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is the original total available time, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`, 
`complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, 
`time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, 
`remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving subtasks.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving subtasks**
