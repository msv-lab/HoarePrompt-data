The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is equivalent to `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

`subtasks_solved` becomes `subtasks_solved + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`. 

The other variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `remaining_time`, `subtask_time` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 1 task, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the first task in the list `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`**.
