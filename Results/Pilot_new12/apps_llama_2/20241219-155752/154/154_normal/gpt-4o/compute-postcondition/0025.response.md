Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k` and must have at least one more element to process, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` may be updated, `max_points` may be updated, `complete_tasks` may be updated, if `remaining_time >= subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `time_used` may be updated, and `remaining_time` is equal to its previous value minus `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged***
