The code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` reduces the value of `remaining_time` by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. The value of `remaining_time` was equal to `M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]`. After subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from it, the new value of `remaining_time` is `M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0] - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is `0`, `complete_tasks` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0] - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time` before update, and `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + remaining_time // subtask_time` before update**
