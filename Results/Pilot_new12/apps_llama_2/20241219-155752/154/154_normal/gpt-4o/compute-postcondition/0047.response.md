According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 2 elements, `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`, `subtask_index` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `t` must have at least 3 elements and the `subtask_index` is 2 and `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`, `subtask_index` is 2**
