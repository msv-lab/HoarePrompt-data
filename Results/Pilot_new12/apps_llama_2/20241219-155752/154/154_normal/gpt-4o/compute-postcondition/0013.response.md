The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is equal to `(M - time_used) // t[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is still a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is still a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, 
`t` is still a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k` and `t` must have at least 1 task, 
`total_time_per_task` is still a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, 
`points` is still equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`subtask_time` is still the first task in `t`, 
`time_used` is still defined, 
`max_points` is still `0`, 
`complete_tasks` is still `0`, 
`remaining_time` is still `M - time_used`, and 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is still `(M - time_used) // t[0]`.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k` and `t` must have at least 1 task, 
`total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, 
`points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`subtask_time` is the first task in `t`, 
`time_used` is defined, 
`max_points` is `0`, 
`complete_tasks` is `0`, 
`remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]`, 
and `subtasks_solved` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k` and `t` must have at least 1 task, `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtask_time` is the first task in `t`, `time_used` is defined, `max_points` is `0`, `complete_tasks` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]`, and `subtasks_solved` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]`.**
