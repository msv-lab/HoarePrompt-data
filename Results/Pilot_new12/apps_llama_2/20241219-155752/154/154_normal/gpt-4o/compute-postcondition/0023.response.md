The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k` and must have at least one more element to process, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` may be updated, `max_points` may be updated, `complete_tasks` may be updated, `remaining_time` and `time_used` may be updated based on the loop body, `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task` (i.e., its previous value plus `remaining_time // subtask_time`), and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
