The value of `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` remains the same, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, `subtasks_solved` remains the same as the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` remains the same as the original `M` minus the total time used for all completed subtasks, and `time_used` remains the same as the total time spent on subtasks.
