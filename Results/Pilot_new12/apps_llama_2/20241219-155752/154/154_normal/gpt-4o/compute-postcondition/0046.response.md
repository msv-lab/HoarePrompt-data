Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`, `subtask_index` is 1, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is increased by `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time)) // subtask_time` and `remaining_time` is updated to `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time) - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time` where `remaining_time` on the right-hand side is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time)`; the state of `subtasks_solved` and `remaining_time` remains unchanged if `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`.**
