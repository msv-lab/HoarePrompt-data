The code `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` updates the value of `subtasks_solved` by taking the minimum between its current value and the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`. 

The value of `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
the value of `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
the value of `M` is the original total available time, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `time_used` are as per their initial or externally updated values, 
`subtasks_solved` is updated as per the given equation, and 
`remaining_time` is `M` minus the total time used by all solved subtasks.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `time_used` are as per their initial or externally updated values, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `remaining_time` is `M` minus the total time used by all solved subtasks.**
