Output State: **The program returns max_points, which is the maximum achievable points considering completed tasks and subtasks within the time limit M, where M is the original total available time, and the tasks and subtasks are determined by the lists and variables: n, a non-negative integer between 1 and 45, k, a non-negative integer between 1 and 45, t, a list of non-negative integers of length k, and total_time_per_task, the sum of all elements in t.**
