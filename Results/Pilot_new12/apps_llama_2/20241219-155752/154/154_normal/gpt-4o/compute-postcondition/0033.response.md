The value of `points` is updated to be equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
the value of `k` is still a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is still the original total available time, 
`t` is still a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, 
`total_time_per_task` is still the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`max_points` is still the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, 
`complete_tasks` is still increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, 
`subtasks_solved` is still the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, 
`remaining_time` is still the original `M` minus the total time used for all completed subtasks, 
and `time_used` is still equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; 
if `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise the execution continues with the updated values.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `remaining_time` is the original `M` minus the total time used for all completed subtasks, and `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; if `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise the execution continues with the updated values.**
