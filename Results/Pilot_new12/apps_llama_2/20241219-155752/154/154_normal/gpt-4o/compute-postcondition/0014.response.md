To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`.
   - `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`.
   - `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`.
   - `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`.
   - `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
   - `subtask_time` is the first task in `t`, so `subtask_time = t[0]`.
   - `time_used` is defined.
   - `max_points` is `0`.
   - `complete_tasks` is `0`.
   - `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`.
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]`.
   - `subtasks_solved` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]`.

2. The code provided is:
   ```
   remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
   ```

Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - time_used) // t[0]` and `subtask_time` is `t[0]`, we substitute these into the equation:
   ```
   remaining_time -= ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]
   ```

Since `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, we substitute it as well:
   ```
   M - time_used -= ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]
   ```

This simplifies to:
   ```
   M - time_used = M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]
   ```

The equation can be further simplified by recognizing that in the context of integer division, `((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]` represents the largest multiple of `t[0]` that is less than or equal to `M - time_used`. Thus, the subtraction of this value from `M - time_used` effectively removes the largest whole number of `t[0]` durations from `M - time_used`, leaving a remainder.

However, to precisely describe the output state:
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `M` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `total_time_per_task` remains the same.
- `points` remains the same.
- `subtask_time` remains the same.
- `time_used` increases by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` because `remaining_time` decreases by this amount, implying `time_used` increases by the same amount.
- `max_points` remains the same.
- `complete_tasks` remains the same.
- `remaining_time` decreases by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, which is `((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]`.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtasks_solved` would need to be recalculated based on the new `remaining_time` and `time_used` to reflect the updated state accurately.

Thus, the `remaining_time` becomes:
   ```
   M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]
   ```

Which simplifies conceptually to the remainder of `M - time_used` after subtracting the largest whole number of `t[0]` durations, but in terms of the original variables, it directly results from the subtraction.

Given the complexity of directly calculating the new `remaining_time` without specific values for `M`, `time_used`, and `t[0]`, we focus on the conceptual change:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, `total_time_per_task` is equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtask_time` is `t[0]`, `time_used` has increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_points` is `0`, `complete_tasks` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used - ((M - time_used) // t[0]) * t[0]`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` would need to be recalculated based on the new `remaining_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is also subject to recalculation based on the updated `remaining_time`.**
