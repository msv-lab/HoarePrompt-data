To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides several conditions and variable assignments, but the code snippet only updates the `remaining_time` variable. 

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is the original total available time
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`
- `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`
- `remaining_time` is initially `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`

The code snippet is:
```python
remaining_time = M - time_used
```

Given that `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, the code snippet essentially simplifies to:
```python
remaining_time = M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
```

This means `remaining_time` is updated to be the original total available time `M` minus the time used, which is the product of the number of tasks completed (`complete_tasks`) and the total time per task (`total_time_per_task`).

Therefore, the output state after executing the code snippet, considering the initial conditions and the update to `remaining_time`, is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is the original total available time
- `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`
- `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`
- `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`

Since the update to `remaining_time` does not change the fact that it equals `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` (as this was its initial definition), we see that the code snippet does not introduce any new information or changes to the variables beyond what was initially stated, except that it affirms `remaining_time` equals this expression.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
