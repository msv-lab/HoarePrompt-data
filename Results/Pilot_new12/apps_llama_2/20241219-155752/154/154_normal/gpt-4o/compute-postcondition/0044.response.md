The value of `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The previous value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. 

Given that `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`, and `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % (second element in the list `t`))`, 
and `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, 
and `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
and `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, 
and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
and `M` is the original total available time, 
and `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 2 elements, 
and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
and `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, 
if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, 
and `subtask_index` is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is the original total available time, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` that must have at least 2 elements, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, 
`complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, 
`time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`, 
`subtask_index` is 1, 
`remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % (second element in the list `t`))`, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, 
`subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`.
