The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, `time_used`, `subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` are not changed by this code. 

The number of subtasks for the current task is determined by the available `remaining_time` and the time required for each subtask `subtask_time`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is the original total available time, 
`t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, 
`total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, 
`points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, 
`time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`subtask_time` is the third task in the list `t`, 
`remaining_time` may have been updated, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the third task in the list `t`, `remaining_time` may have been updated, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
