Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k` and `t` must have at least 1 task, `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, initially `subtasks_solved` was `0`, initially `subtask_time` was the first task in `t`, the program had a condition where if `time_used` is less than or equal to `M`, the program continues execution, if `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `max_points` being `0`, `complete_tasks` being `0`, the current value of `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, the current value of `subtask_time` is still the first task in `t`, and the current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.**
