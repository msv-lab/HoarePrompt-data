The code initializes a new variable `max_points` and assigns it the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` such that `1 <= t[i] <= 1000000` for `0 <= i < k`, `total_time_per_task` is a non-negative integer equal to `sum(t)`, and `max_points` is `0`**
