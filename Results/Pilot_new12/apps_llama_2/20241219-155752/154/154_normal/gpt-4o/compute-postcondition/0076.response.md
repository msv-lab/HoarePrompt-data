Given the initial state, the provided code affects the `remaining_time` variable by subtracting the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time` from it.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `complete_tasks` is the number of tasks completed, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is the third task in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time` before the update of `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
