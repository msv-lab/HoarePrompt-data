The code updates the value of `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is as per its initial or externally updated values, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is as per its initial or externally updated values, `time_used` is as per its initial or externally updated values, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `remaining_time` is `M` minus the total time used by all solved subtasks**.
