The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. `n` and `k` are non-negative integers between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer with a maximum value of 2*10^9, and `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k`, where each element in `t` is between 1 and 1000000. 

After executing the function body, the function returns `max_points`, which represents the maximum achievable points considering completed tasks and subtasks within the given time limit `M`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, and return the maximum achievable points based on the tasks and subtasks determined by these inputs within the time limit `M`.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the maximum achievable points based on the tasks and subtasks within the given time limit M.**
