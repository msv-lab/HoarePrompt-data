Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is the original total available time, `t` is a list of non-negative integers of length `k` with at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + 0`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtask_time` is `t[2]`, `subtask_index` is 2, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]`, and `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[2]) * t[2]`.**
