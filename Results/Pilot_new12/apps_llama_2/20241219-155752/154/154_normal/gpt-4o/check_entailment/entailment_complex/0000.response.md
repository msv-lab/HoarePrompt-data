Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description says. 

The issue with the program lies in the way it calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time after completing some tasks. 

In the given code, the program iterates over the subtask times and for each subtask time, it calculates how many subtasks of that type can be solved with the remaining time. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum number of points because it does not consider the optimal order in which subtasks should be solved.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2`, `k = 3`, `M = 10`, and `t = [1, 2, 3]`. If the program decides to complete one task (which takes 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 minutes), it will have 4 minutes remaining. With the current implementation, it will try to solve as many subtasks of the first type (which takes 1 minute) as possible, but it will not consider the possibility of solving subtasks of other types that might give more points.

A correct approach would be to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal order in which subtasks should be solved to maximize the points earned. 

One possible solution is to sort the subtasks in ascending order of their times and then try to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. 

In the case where the input is `n = 5`, `k = 5`, and `M = 10`, and `t = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`, the program should solve the first subtask of all five tasks (which takes 5 minutes) and then solve the second subtask of two tasks (which takes 4 minutes), resulting in a total of 5 + 2 = 7 points. 

However, the program, as it is now, may not always find the optimal solution. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**. 

Here is an example of how the code should be modified to correctly solve the problem:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        subtask_time_sorted = sorted(t)
        remaining_tasks = n - complete_tasks
        
        for subtask_time in subtask_time_sorted:
            max_subtasks_for_this_task = min(remaining_time // subtask_time, remaining_tasks * k)
            subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
            remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    return max_points
```

This modified code first sorts the subtask times in ascending order and then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. It also ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the remaining tasks. This approach guarantees the maximum number of points that can be earned within the given time limit.
