Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum achievable points in all cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the subtasks solved after completing tasks. The current implementation solves the same subtask for all remaining tasks, which may not always be the optimal solution. 

For example, if we have n = 3, k = 2, M = 10, and t = [3, 7], the program will first try to complete tasks. Since completing one task takes 3 + 7 = 10 minutes, which equals M, it will not try to solve any subtasks for the remaining tasks. However, the optimal solution would be to solve the first subtask for all three tasks, which would take 3 minutes each, giving a total of 3 * 3 = 9 minutes, and then solve the first subtask for the first task, which would take 3 minutes, but this exceeds the time limit.

However, if we consider the case where n = 2, k = 3, M = 12, and t = [2, 3, 7], the optimal solution would be to complete one task (2 + 3 + 7 = 12 minutes), but the program tries to solve subtasks after completing tasks, which may lead to solving the same subtask multiple times or not considering all possible subtask combinations.

A correct solution would involve considering all possible combinations of subtasks for the remaining tasks after completing tasks and choosing the combination that maximizes the points achieved within the given time limit. 

In this case, a correct algorithm would involve dynamic programming or recursion to explore all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks, which the provided code does not implement correctly. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
