Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not accurately solve the problem as described. 

The main issue with the program is in the way it calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time after completing some tasks. 

In the problem description, it's mentioned that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order, and the time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, not on the task itself. However, in the given program, it tries to solve subtasks of the same type (i.e., same index) from all the remaining tasks first before moving on to the next type of subtask. 

This approach is not optimal because it doesn't consider all possible combinations of subtasks that could be solved within the remaining time. 

For example, consider a scenario with 3 tasks, each having 3 subtasks with times [1, 2, 3] respectively. If the total time available is 6, the program would first try to complete as many tasks as possible, which in this case is 1 task (time used = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6). However, the optimal solution would be to solve the first subtask of all 3 tasks (time used = 3 * 1 = 3) and then solve the second subtask of 2 tasks (time used = 2 * 2 = 4), for a total of 3 + 2 + 1 (for the task with 2 subtasks) = 6 points, which is more than the points obtained by the program.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use dynamic programming to consider all possible combinations of subtasks and tasks that could be solved within the given time limit. 

Here's a corrected version of the code in Python:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))

max_points = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range((n - i) * k + 1):
        time_used = sum(t[:j])
        if time_used <= M:
            points = i * (k + 1) + j
            max_points = max(max_points, points)
        else:
            break

print(max_points)
```
This corrected version of the program iterates over all possible combinations of completed tasks and subtasks, calculates the total time used, and updates the maximum points if the current combination yields more points. However, this solution is still not optimal due to its high time complexity.

A more efficient solution would be to use a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum points that can be achieved within the given time limit:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
t = list(map(int, input().split()))

t.sort()
dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(M + 1):
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        for subtask in range(min(k, j // t[0]) + 1):
            time_used = sum(t[:subtask])
            if time_used <= j:
                points = k + 1 if subtask == k else subtask
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], points + dp[i - 1][j - time_used])

print(dp[n][M])
```
This solution first sorts the subtask times in ascending order. Then, it initializes a 2D dynamic programming table `dp` to store the maximum points that can be achieved with `i` tasks and `j` time. The solution iterates over all tasks and subtasks, updates the `dp` table, and finally prints the maximum points that can be achieved with `n` tasks and `M` time.
