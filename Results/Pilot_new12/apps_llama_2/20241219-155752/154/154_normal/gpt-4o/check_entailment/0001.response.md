Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn in all potential cases. It only considers solving complete tasks first and then using the remaining time to solve subtasks from incomplete tasks. However, this approach does not consider all possible combinations of solving subtasks from different tasks that can give a higher total score.

A counterexample is when `n = 5`, `k = 5`, `M = 15`, and `t = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`. In this case, the program may not consider the optimal solution of solving the first and second subtasks of all five tasks, which would give a total of `5 + 2 = 7` points for the first and second subtasks, respectively, and use up all the available time.

However, a better approach would be to solve the first subtask of 5 tasks and the second subtask of 2 tasks, using `5*1 + 2*2 = 9` minutes, earning `5 + 2 = 7` points. This would indeed be the optimal solution.

The problem can be more efficiently solved by using dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of solving subtasks from different tasks, and selecting the combination that gives the highest total score within the given time limit.

The current implementation only scratches the surface of the problem by considering the most straightforward cases but does not account for the complexity of combining tasks in various ways to maximize points within the given time constraint.

A correct approach involves examining all possible ways to allocate the time across tasks and their subtasks, not just sequentially completing tasks or adding subtasks in order of their time requirement, but considering the intersection of completing tasks and maximizing the use of time to earn points from subtasks, taking into account the bonus for completing a task.

To correctly solve this, one should consider a more sophisticated algorithm or method, potentially involving dynamic programming to account for all possible allocations of time across tasks and subtasks, aiming to maximize the total points earned. 

The given code is a simple attempt but does not fully address the problem's complexity, leading to it not being correct for all possible inputs.
