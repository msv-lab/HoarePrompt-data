You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn in all potential cases. It only considers solving complete tasks first and then using the remaining time to solve subtasks from incomplete tasks. However, this approach does not consider all possible combinations of solving subtasks from different tasks that can give a higher total score.

A counterexample is when `n = 5`, `k = 5`, `M = 15`, and `t = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`. In this case, the program may not consider the optimal solution of solving the first and second subtasks of all five tasks, which would give a total of `5 + 2 = 7` points for the first and second subtasks, respectively, and use up all the available time.

However, a better approach would be to solve the first subtask of 5 tasks and the second subtask of 2 tasks, using `5*1 + 2*2 = 9` minutes, earning `5 + 2 = 7` points. This would indeed be the optimal solution.

The problem can be more efficiently solved by using dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of solving subtasks from different tasks, and selecting the combination that gives the highest total score within the given time limit.

The current implementation only scratches the surface of the problem by considering the most straightforward cases but does not account for the complexity of combining tasks in various ways to maximize points within the given time constraint.

A correct approach involves examining all possible ways to allocate the time across tasks and their subtasks, not just sequentially completing tasks or adding subtasks in order of their time requirement, but considering the intersection of completing tasks and maximizing the use of time to earn points from subtasks, taking into account the bonus for completing a task.

To correctly solve this, one should consider a more sophisticated algorithm or method, potentially involving dynamic programming to account for all possible allocations of time across tasks and subtasks, aiming to maximize the total points earned. 

The given code is a simple attempt but does not fully address the problem's complexity, leading to it not being correct for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])

result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and M are non-negative integers, and t is a list of non-negative integers of length k, such that 1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, 0 <= M <= 2*10^9, and 1 <= t[i] <= 1000000 for 0 <= i < k.

    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is the maximum achievable points considering completed tasks and subtasks within the time limit M, where M is the original total available time, and the tasks and subtasks are determined by the lists and variables: n, a non-negative integer between 1 and 45, k, a non-negative integer between 1 and 45, t, a list of non-negative integers of length k, and total_time_per_task, the sum of all elements in t.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
