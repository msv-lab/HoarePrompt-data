The function calculates and prints the sum of the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `M` using the first `i` items, for all `i` from 1 to `k`, plus the count of subsets where the maximum number of items equals the subset size `i`. The function accepts input integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and a list `t` of `k` positive integers, where `n` and `k` are positive integers less than or equal to 45, `M` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and each `t_j` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000. After execution, the function's output is the calculated sum, and the state of the program includes the input variables `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, as well as the calculated 2D list `dp` containing the maximum number of items that can be included in subsets of various total values using different numbers of items. Note that the variable `n` is not used in the function, and the function does not handle edge cases where `M` exceeds 2 * 10^9 or where the input list `t` has fewer than `k` elements. Additionally, the function does not validate the input values to ensure they are within the specified ranges.
