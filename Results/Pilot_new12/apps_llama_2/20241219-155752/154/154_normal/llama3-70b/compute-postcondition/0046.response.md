To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given code and its impact on the variables. The code provided is:

```python
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer,
- `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3,
- `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 3,
- `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers,
- `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order,
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[3][3] = dp[3][2]`,
- `i` is 3,
- `j` is 3.

Let's analyze the code's impact:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.
- Since `i` is 3 and `j` is 3, we are specifically looking at `dp[3][3]`.
- The expression `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` translates to `dp[2][3 - t[2]]`.
- Given that `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order and `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t[2]` (which corresponds to the third element in the list `t` since indexing starts at 0) is a positive integer.
- The value of `dp[2][3 - t[2]]` depends on the value of `t[2]`. If `3 - t[2]` is less than 0, this could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds error or a need for a special condition to handle negative indices, depending on the language and how `dp` is initialized. However, assuming that `dp` is properly initialized to handle such cases or that `t[2]` is small enough (1 or 2) to keep the index within bounds, we proceed.
- Given that `dp[3][3] = dp[3][2]` initially, the update rule essentially compares this initial value with `dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1` and chooses the maximum.
- The states of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t_j`, and `t` are not affected by this update.
- The value of `i` and `j` are used but not changed by the update.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `n` remains an input integer,
- `k` remains an input integer greater than or equal to 3,
- `M` remains a non-negative integer greater than 3,
- `t_j` remains a list of `k` positive integers,
- `t` remains a sorted list of input integers in ascending order,
- `dp` is updated such that `dp[3][3]` is the maximum of its original value (`dp[3][2]`) and `dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1`,
- `i` is still 3,
- `j` is still 3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[3][3]` equals the maximum of its initial value (`dp[3][2]`) and `dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3**
