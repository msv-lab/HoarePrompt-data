The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. 

Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 1, `dp[3][1]` becomes equal to `dp[3][0]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[3][1]` is equal to `dp[3][0]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[3][1]` equals `dp[3][0]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1**
