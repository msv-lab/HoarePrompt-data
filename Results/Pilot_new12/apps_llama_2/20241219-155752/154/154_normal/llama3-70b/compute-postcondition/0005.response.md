According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. If `M` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1. 
For the loop to execute, `M` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
