The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, `dp[2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[2][1]` equals `dp[2][0]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
