The given code line `t = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into strings separated by whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the list of integers to the variable `t`. 

This code does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, and `M`, but it introduces a new variable `t` which is a list of integers. 

The original constraints on `n`, `k`, and `M` are that `n` and `k` should be less than or equal to 45, and `M` should be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`. However, these constraints may not hold after the new input is taken.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `t_j` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, and `t` is a list of input integers**
