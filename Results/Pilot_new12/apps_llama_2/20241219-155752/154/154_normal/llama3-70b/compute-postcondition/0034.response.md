According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `j` using the first `i` items, `i` is 3**
