Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, then `dp[2][1]` equals `max(dp[2][1], dp[1][1 - t[1]] + 1)`.***
