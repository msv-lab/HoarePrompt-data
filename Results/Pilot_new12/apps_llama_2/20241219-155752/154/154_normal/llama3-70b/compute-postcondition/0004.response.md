According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 1, which is the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer, `t_j` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1**
