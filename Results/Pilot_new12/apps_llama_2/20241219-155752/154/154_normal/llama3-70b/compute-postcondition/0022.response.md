Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where initially `dp[2][1]` equals `dp[2][0]`, `i` is 2, the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, and `j` is 1**
