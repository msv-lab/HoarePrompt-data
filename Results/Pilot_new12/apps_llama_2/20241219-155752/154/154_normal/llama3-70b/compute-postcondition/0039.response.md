Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[2]`, then `dp[3][1]` equals `max(dp[3][0], dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1)`.***
