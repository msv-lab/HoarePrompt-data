According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. So, `i` becomes 2. The rest of the variables remain the same.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, and `i` is 2**
