Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where initially `dp[1][1]` equals 0, `i` is 1, the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, and `j` is 1 or more,  `t` at index `i-1` has a value that is less than or equal to `j`.**
