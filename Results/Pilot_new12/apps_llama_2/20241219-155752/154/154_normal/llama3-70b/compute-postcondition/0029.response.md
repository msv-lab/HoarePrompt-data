According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `M` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `M` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`**
