The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `dp[1][2]` becomes equal to `dp[1][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 1, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[1][2]` = `dp[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
