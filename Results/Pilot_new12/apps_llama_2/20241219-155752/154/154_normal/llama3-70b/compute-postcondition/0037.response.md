Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where the current value of `dp[3][1]` equals the current value of `dp[3][0]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the current value of `t` at index `i - 1`.**
