The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, `dp[2][2]` becomes the maximum of its current value, which is equal to `dp[2][1]`, and `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`. Since `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order and `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, the value of `t[1]` is a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[2][2]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[2][1]` and `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
