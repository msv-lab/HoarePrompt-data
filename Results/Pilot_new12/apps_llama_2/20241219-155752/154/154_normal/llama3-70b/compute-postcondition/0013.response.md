Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is greater than 1, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[1][2]` equals `max(dp[1][1], dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1)` if `2 - t[0]` is within bounds, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, otherwise the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
