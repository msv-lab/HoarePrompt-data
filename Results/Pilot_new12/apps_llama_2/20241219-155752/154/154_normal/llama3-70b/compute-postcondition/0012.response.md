To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The code `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` plus 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `M` must be greater than 1
- `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`
- `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[1][2]` = `dp[1][1]`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2

We note that `t` and `t_j` seem to represent the same list of integers, with `t_j` being an element of this list. For clarity, we'll proceed with the understanding that `t` is the list, and its elements are positive integers.

The update affects `dp[i][j]`, using the values of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` and `t[i - 1]`. Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, and knowing that list indices in Python start at 0, `t[i - 1]` refers to the first element of `t` (since `i - 1` equals 0), and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` refers to `dp[0][2 - t[0]]`.

However, there's an important consideration: since `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, and `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the operation `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` is valid as long as `j - t[i - 1]` is within the bounds of the `dp` list, specifically `0 <= j - t[i - 1] <= M`.

Given `dp[1][2]` is initially equal to `dp[1][1]`, and without specific initial values for `dp[0][j - t[0]]`, we can say that `dp[1][2]` will be updated to the maximum of its current value (`dp[1][1]`) and `dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1`, if `2 - t[0]` is within the valid range for `dp[0]`.

The states of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t_j` (or `t`), and `i`, `j` do not change. The value of `dp[i][j]` (specifically `dp[1][2]`) is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the calculated value from `dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1`, assuming `2 - t[0]` is a valid index.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is greater than 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[1][2]` is updated to `max(dp[1][2], dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1)` if `2 - t[0]` is within the bounds, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is greater than 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[1][2]` equals `max(dp[1][1], dp[0][2 - t[0]] + 1)` if `2 - t[0]` is within bounds, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
