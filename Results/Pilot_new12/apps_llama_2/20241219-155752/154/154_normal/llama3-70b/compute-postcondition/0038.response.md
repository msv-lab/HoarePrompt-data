The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

The state of `n` is not affected because it is an input integer and its value does not change. 
The state of `k` is not affected because it is an input integer greater than or equal to 3 and its value does not change. 
The state of `M` is not affected because it is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0 and its value does not change. 
The state of `t_j` is not affected because it is a list of `k` positive integers and its value does not change. 
The state of `t` is not affected because it is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order and its value does not change. 
The state of `dp` is affected only at `dp[i][j]`, where `i` equals 3 and `j` equals 1. 
The state of `i` is not affected because it is 3 and its value does not change. 
The state of `j` is not affected because it is 1 and its value does not change.

The value of `dp[3][1]` becomes the maximum of its current value (which equals `dp[3][0]`) and `dp[3 - 1][1 - t[3 - 1]] + 1` (which equals `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1`).

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where the value of `dp[3][1]` equals the maximum of the old value of `dp[3][1]` (which equals `dp[3][0]`) and `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the current value of `t` at index `i - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[3][1]` equals `max(dp[3][0], dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1)`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `t[2]`.**
