The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

`dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` plus 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer greater than 0, `M` remains a positive integer, `t_j` remains a list of `k` positive integers, `t` remains a sorted list of input integers in ascending order. 

The 2D list `dp` is updated at `dp[i][j]`, `i` remains 2, and `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[2][1]` equals `max(dp[2][1], dp[1][1 - t[1]] + 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`**
