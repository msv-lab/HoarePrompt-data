The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `j` is 1. Since `dp` is a 2D list with all elements initialized to 0, and `i` and `j` are within the valid range, `dp[1][1]` is now equal to `dp[1][0]`, which is 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[1][1]` equals `dp[1][0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[1][1]` equals 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
