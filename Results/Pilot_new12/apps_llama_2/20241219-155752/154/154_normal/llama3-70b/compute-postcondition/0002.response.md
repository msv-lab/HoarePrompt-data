The code sorts the list `t` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t_j` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `t_j` is a list of k positive integers where 1 â‰¤ `t_j` â‰¤ 1000000 for each `j`, and `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order**
