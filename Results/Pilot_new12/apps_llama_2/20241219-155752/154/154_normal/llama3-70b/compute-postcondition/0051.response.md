The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t_j`. `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 45, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to 45, `M` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`. 

However, since the output cases are not provided in the problem description, I will only describe the accepted parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and a list t_j, where n and k are positive integers less than or equal to 45, M is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and t_j is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for each j.**
