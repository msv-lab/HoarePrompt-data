Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[2][2]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[2][1]` and `dp[1][2 - t[1]] + 1`***
