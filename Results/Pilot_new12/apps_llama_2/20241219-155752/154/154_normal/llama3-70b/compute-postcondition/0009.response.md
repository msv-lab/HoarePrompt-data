Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, `i` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, and `j` is 1 or more. Since there is no else part, if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`, the state of `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
