Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `M` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, and `dp` is a 2D list where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[3][3]` equals the maximum of its initial value (`dp[3][2]`) and `dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1`***
