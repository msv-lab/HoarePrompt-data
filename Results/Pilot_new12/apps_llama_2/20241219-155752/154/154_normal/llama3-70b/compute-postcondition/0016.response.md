The provided code is updating the value of `dp[i][j]` with the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

The value of `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. The value of `dp[1][3]` will be updated with the maximum of its current value (`dp[1][3]`) and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`. 

Given that `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order and `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, we know that `t[0]` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t[0]` ≤ 1000000.

Therefore, `dp[1][3]` will be updated with the maximum of its current value (`dp[1][2]`) and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` must be greater than 2, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000 for each `j`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[1][3]` equals `max(dp[1][3], dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1)`, `dp[1][2]` equals `dp[1][3]` initially, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
