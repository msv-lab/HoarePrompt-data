The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 3 respectively, so `dp[2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[2][3]` is equal to `dp[2][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[2][3] = dp[2][2]`**
