The code updates the values of `n`, `k`, and `M` based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these values to `n`, `k`, and `M` respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, and `t_j` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for each j, note that `n`, `k`, and `M` are assigned new values from the input, but there are no constraints on these new values based on the given code, the original constraints are that n and k should be less than or equal to 45, and M should be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9**
