Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the fact that the variable `n`, which represents the number of tasks, is not utilized in the function. The function should consider the maximum points that can be earned by completing subtasks across all tasks, not just the subtasks within a single task.

The code sorts the time required for each subtask (`t`) and uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit (`M`). However, the `dp` table is only filled considering the subtasks individually, without accounting for the possibility of earning extra points by completing a task.

Moreover, the calculation of the final score is incorrect. The function sums up the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed for each subset of subtasks (`dp[i][M]` for all `i`), which does not accurately represent the maximum points that can be earned. Additionally, the function counts the subsets where the maximum number of subtasks equals the subset size (`i`), but this approach is also incorrect.

To accurately solve the problem, the function should use dynamic programming to consider all possible combinations of subtasks across all tasks and calculate the maximum points that can be earned. The function should also account for the extra points earned by completing a task.

For example, given the input:
```
3 4 11
1 2 3 4
```
The function should return 6, because Polycarp can complete the first task and earn 5 points (4 subtasks + 1 extra point), and then complete 1 subtask from the second task to earn an additional point.

However, the provided code does not produce the correct output for this example, which indicates that the code does not accurately solve the problem.
