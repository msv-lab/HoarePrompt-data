Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the calculation of the maximum points Polycarp can earn. The code attempts to use dynamic programming to solve the problem, but it does not correctly account for the points earned by completely solving tasks and the points earned by partially solving tasks.

In the problem description, Polycarp earns one extra point for completely solving a task, but the code does not correctly calculate this. It simply sums the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `M` using the first `i` items, for all `i` from 1 to `k`, plus the count of subsets where the maximum number of items equals the subset size `i`. This approach does not align with the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `k = 4`, and `M = 11`, with task times `t = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. According to the problem description, Polycarp can complete the first task and spend `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` minutes, earning `5` points. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute, earning `1` more point. Therefore, the maximum points Polycarp can earn in this case is `6`. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate this scenario.

The code also does not utilize the variable `n`, which represents the number of tasks. This could be a crucial factor in determining the maximum points Polycarp can earn, as the problem description states that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order across all tasks.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should be revised to account for the points earned by completely solving tasks and the points earned by partially solving tasks, considering the number of tasks `n` and the time limits `M`. The code should also ensure that it correctly handles all possible input scenarios, including edge cases, to provide an accurate solution to the problem.
