Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here's why:

1.  The program does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from multiple tasks. The dynamic programming approach used only considers the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved from a single task, not from multiple tasks.

2.  The program also does not consider the extra point that Polycarp receives for completing a task. The dynamic programming approach used only counts the number of subtasks solved, not the number of tasks completed.

3.  The program's output is calculated as the sum of the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `M` using the first `i` items, for all `i` from 1 to `k`, plus the count of subsets where the maximum number of items equals the subset size `i`. This calculation is not correct according to the problem description.

4.  The program does not use the input variable `n`, which represents the number of tasks. This means that the program does not consider the fact that there are multiple tasks, and that Polycarp can solve subtasks from multiple tasks.

5.  The problem description states that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order. The program's dynamic programming approach does consider this, but it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from multiple tasks in any order.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that solves the subtasks with the smallest time requirements first, and considers the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from multiple tasks. The algorithm should also keep track of the number of tasks completed and add the extra point for each completed task.

Here is an example of a correct Python solution:

```python
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()

    points = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        task_points = 0
        task_time = 0
        for time in t:
            if task_time + time <= M:
                task_time += time
                task_points += 1
                M -= time
        if task_points == k:
            points += task_points + 1
        else:
            points += task_points

    print(points)
```

This solution first sorts the time requirements of the subtasks. Then, it iterates over the tasks and tries to solve as many subtasks as possible from each task. If a task is completed, it adds the extra point. The solution also updates the remaining time `M` after each subtask is solved. Finally, it prints the total number of points earned.
