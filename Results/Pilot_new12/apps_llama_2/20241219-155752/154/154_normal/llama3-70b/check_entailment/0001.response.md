Correctness: **False**

The problem with the given code is that it only considers solving subtasks in one task and doesn't take into account the possibility of solving subtasks in multiple tasks.

The code initializes a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved in `j` minutes considering only the first `i` subtasks. However, this approach doesn't consider solving subtasks in multiple tasks.

For example, consider the input `3 4 11` and `1 2 3 4`. The code will only consider solving the first task and then solving one subtask of the second task, whereas the optimal solution is to solve all subtasks in the first task (which takes 10 minutes) and then solve one subtask of the second task (which takes 1 minute).

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider all possible combinations of subtasks in all tasks and keep track of the maximum number of points that can be earned.

Here is a possible correct solution in Python:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    max_points = 0
    for mask in range(1 << (n * k)):
        points = 0
        time = 0
        for i in range(n):
            task_points = 0
            for j in range(k):
                if (mask & (1 << (i * k + j)))!= 0:
                    time += t[j]
                    task_points += 1
            if task_points == k:
                points += k + 1
            else:
                points += task_points
        if time <= M and points > max_points:
            max_points = points
    print(max_points)
```
This solution tries all possible combinations of subtasks in all tasks and keeps track of the maximum number of points that can be earned.

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient dynamic programming approach to solve this problem:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    dp = [0] * (M + 1)
    for i in range(1, M + 1):
        for j in range(k):
            if i >= t[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - t[j]] + 1)
    
    max_points = 0
    for i in range(M + 1):
        points = dp[i]
        time = i
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            points_in_task = 0
            time_in_task = 0
            for j in range(k):
                if time_in_task + t[j] <= M - time:
                    points_in_task += 1
                    time_in_task += t[j]
            if points_in_task == k:
                points += k + 1
            else:
                points += points_in_task
        max_points = max(max_points, points)
    print(max_points)
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved in each time limit and then tries to add subtasks from other tasks to maximize the total points.
