Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1. The problem description asks for the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn, where points are earned by solving subtasks and completing tasks. The program attempts to calculate this by using dynamic programming, but it does not take into account the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order and that completing a task earns an extra point.

2. The program sorts the list of times `t`, which is correct because it allows the program to consider the subtasks in order of increasing time. However, the program then uses this sorted list to calculate the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `M`, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

3. The program prints the sum of `dp[i][M]` for all `i`, which is the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved in time `M` using the first `i` subtasks. However, this does not take into account the fact that completing a task earns an extra point.

4. The program also prints the sum of `1` for all `i` where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`, which is intended to count the number of completed tasks. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order and that completing a task earns an extra point.

5. The program does not consider the number of tasks `n` at all, which is a crucial part of the problem description.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should use a different approach, such as using dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving subtasks and completing tasks, taking into account the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order and that completing a task earns an extra point. The program should also consider the number of tasks `n` and the time limit `M`. 

Here's a correct approach in Python:
```python
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    total_points = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        time_spent = 0
        points_earned = 0
        for i in range(k):
            if time_spent + t[i] <= M:
                time_spent += t[i]
                points_earned += 1
            else:
                break
        if points_earned == k:
            points_earned += 1
        M -= time_spent
        total_points += points_earned
    print(total_points)
```
This program first sorts the list of times `t`, then iterates over each task. For each task, it calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved in the remaining time `M` and earns the corresponding points. If all subtasks are solved, it earns an extra point. The program then subtracts the time spent from the total time `M` and adds the points earned to the total points. Finally, it prints the total points earned.
