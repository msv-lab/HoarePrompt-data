You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it doesn't consider tasks independently. In the problem statement, Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order, but the provided code doesn't consider this fact correctly. It tries to solve subtasks from the first to the last one, without considering the optimal distribution of subtasks among tasks.

For example, if we have two tasks with subtasks requiring 1, 2, 3, and 4 minutes respectively, and Polycarp has 10 minutes, the code will solve the first task completely and then won't have enough time to solve any subtask of the second task. However, the optimal solution would be to solve the first subtask of both tasks (2 minutes each) and then solve the second subtask of one of the tasks (2 minutes).

The problem requires a more complex approach, possibly using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to find the optimal distribution of subtasks among tasks.

Here is a simple example where the program does not work as expected:
Input
2 3 6
1 2 3

The program's output will be 3, but the expected output should be 4. The correct solution is to solve the first two subtasks of both tasks (1 + 2 = 3 minutes for each task), which will give Polycarp 4 points in total (2 * 2 = 4). 

This issue occurs because the code only considers the subtasks in order, but doesn't try to distribute them among tasks in the most efficient way.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 45, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 45, M is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and t_j is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for each j.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `j` using the first `i` items, and if `M` is 0, `dp` remains initialized with all elements as 0.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the sum of the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `M` using the first `i` items, for all `i` from 1 to `k`, plus the count of subsets where the maximum number of items equals the subset size `i`. The function accepts input integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and a list `t` of `k` positive integers, where `n` and `k` are positive integers less than or equal to 45, `M` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and each `t_j` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000. After execution, the function's output is the calculated sum, and the state of the program includes the input variables `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, as well as the calculated 2D list `dp` containing the maximum number of items that can be included in subsets of various total values using different numbers of items. Note that the variable `n` is not used in the function, and the function does not handle edge cases where `M` exceeds 2 * 10^9 or where the input list `t` has fewer than `k` elements. Additionally, the function does not validate the input values to ensure they are within the specified ranges.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
