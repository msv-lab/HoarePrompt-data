#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 45, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 45, M is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and t_j is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for each j.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t_j` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `j` using the first `i` items, and if `M` is 0, `dp` remains initialized with all elements as 0.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the sum of the maximum number of items that can be included in a subset of total value `M` using the first `i` items, for all `i` from 1 to `k`, plus the count of subsets where the maximum number of items equals the subset size `i`. The function accepts input integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, and a list `t` of `k` positive integers, where `n` and `k` are positive integers less than or equal to 45, `M` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^9, and each `t_j` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `t_j` ≤ 1000000. After execution, the function's output is the calculated sum, and the state of the program includes the input variables `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, as well as the calculated 2D list `dp` containing the maximum number of items that can be included in subsets of various total values using different numbers of items. Note that the variable `n` is not used in the function, and the function does not handle edge cases where `M` exceeds 2 * 10^9 or where the input list `t` has fewer than `k` elements. Additionally, the function does not validate the input values to ensure they are within the specified ranges.
