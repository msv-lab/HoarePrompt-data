According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is a positive integer greater than 9 and not divisible by 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4. The condition for the loop to execute again also depends on `num`, specifically `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `num`. Since `i` is now 4, the square root of `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, which means `num` must be greater than or equal to 16.

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 16 and not divisible by 3, `i` is 4**
