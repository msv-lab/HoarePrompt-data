To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration.
- `num` is not divisible by `i` (i.e., `num` % `i`!= 0).

Loop statement:
```python
for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, since the loop iterates over a range of numbers. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

The loop condition is that `i` should be less than or equal to the square root of `num`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still hold true. Since `i` is now 3, `num` must be such that its square root is greater than 3. This implies that `num` must be greater than 9 (since 3^2 = 9).

The condition that `num` is not divisible by `i` must also hold for the new value of `i`. Therefore, `num` should not be divisible by 3.

Considering all these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented, and the conditions regarding `num` and its relationship with `i` are maintained.

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 9 and not divisible by 3, `i` is 3**
