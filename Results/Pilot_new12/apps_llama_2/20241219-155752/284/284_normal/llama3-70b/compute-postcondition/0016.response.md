Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if a given positive integer `num` between 1 and 1000 is a prime number and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. It specifically returns `False` for input values less than 2. The function iterates through possible divisors from 2 to the square root of `num` and returns `False` as soon as it finds a divisor, indicating `num` is not prime. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating `num` is prime. The function handles edge cases by returning `False` for numbers less than 2, implicitly covering the case for 1, which is not considered a prime number. The final state of the program after it concludes is either returning `True` to confirm `num` as a prime number or `False` to indicate it is not, based on the conditions checked during the function's execution.**
