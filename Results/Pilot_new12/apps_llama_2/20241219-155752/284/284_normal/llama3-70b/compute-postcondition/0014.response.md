Given that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is the square root of `num` (or the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `num`), when the program executes the statement `return True`, it directly returns the boolean value `True` without any modifications to the variables `num` and `i`. The implications of `num` being a prime number, as suggested by the context that if the function hasn't returned `False` it implies `num` is prime, are not directly affected by the `return True` statement itself, but rather by the program's logic leading up to this point.

Output State: **The program returns True, indicating that 'num' is a prime number, where 'num' is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 2.**
