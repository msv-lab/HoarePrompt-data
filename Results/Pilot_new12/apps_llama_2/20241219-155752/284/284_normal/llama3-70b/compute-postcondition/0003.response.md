To determine the program state at the start of the for loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement. The loop iterates over a range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). For this loop to execute, `num` must be a positive integer such that its square root is at least 2, because the upper limit of the range is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. However, since `num` is already given to be greater than or equal to 2, we primarily need to focus on the condition that makes the loop execute at least once.

Given that `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000, the square root of `num` will always be greater than or equal to the square root of 2 (approximately 1.414), but since the range starts at 2, we are interested in when `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 2, meaning `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute more than once or exactly 1 for it to execute once (considering the range starts at 2).

However, considering the definition of the range in the for loop, for `i` to be within the range from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, `num` itself does not necessarily need adjustment, but the understanding of `i` and the condition for the loop to execute does. Since `i` starts at 2, for the loop to have at least one iteration, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 2, implying `num`'s square root must be at least 1, which is always true given `num` is at least 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the loop needs to reflect that `i` is initialized to 2 (as per the loop definition) and that `num` allows for at least one iteration of the loop, which is inherently satisfied by the given constraints on `num`. 

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
