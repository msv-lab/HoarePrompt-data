To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states after a few iterations.

The loop checks each number `i` from 2 up to the square root of `num` (inclusive) to see if `num` is divisible by `i`. If `num` is divisible by any of these `i` values, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it implies that `num` has no divisors other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

Given the initial state that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, and analyzing the loop's behavior:

- If `num` is divisible by any number `i` in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`, the loop will terminate early, returning `False`.
- If `num` is not divisible by any of these numbers, the loop will complete, and since there's no explicit return statement after the loop, the implication is that `num` is a prime number.

However, it's crucial to note that the loop provided does not explicitly return a value if `num` is prime (not divisible by any `i` in the loop). The output states provided help in understanding the conditions under which the loop executes but do not directly state the final output if the loop completes without finding a divisor.

The loop's purpose seems to be checking for primality, but it only returns `False` if a divisor is found. The output states given for the first few iterations help understand the loop's progression but do not imply a specific return value or state if the loop completes without finding a divisor, other than `i` reaching its final value in the range.

Considering the loop's structure and the information given, if the loop completes without returning `False`, it suggests that `num` is prime. However, the loop's code as provided doesn't explicitly handle the case where `num` is prime by returning a specific value or setting a variable to indicate primality.

Given the task's format requirement and focusing on the variable values after the loop executes:

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the square root of `num` (or the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `num`), and if the function hasn't returned `False`, it implies `num` is a prime number, though the loop itself doesn't explicitly return or set a variable to this effect.**
