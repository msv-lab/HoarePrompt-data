Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code works as expected according to the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is prime or not by iterating through possible divisors up to the square root of the number. 

For the main part of the program, it iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n*m + 1` is prime using the `func_1` function. As soon as it finds an `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not prime, it prints that `m` and breaks the loop. 

This approach guarantees to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis for any given `n`, because it checks all possible values of `m` up to 1000 and stops as soon as it finds one that results in a non-prime `n*m + 1`.

The code handles the edge cases correctly: for numbers less than 2, the `func_1` function returns `False` as expected, since these numbers are not prime.

The examples provided also work correctly with this code: for `n = 3`, the output is `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4`, which is not prime; and for `n = 4`, the output is `2` because `4*2 + 1 = 9`, which is not prime.

Overall, the code correctly solves the problem and finds a counterexample for any given `n` within the specified range.
