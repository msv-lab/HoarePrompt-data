Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. It takes an integer `n` as input and starts iterating over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
2. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1` and checks if this number is prime using the `func_1` function.
3. If `func_1` returns `False` (indicating that `n * m + 1` is not prime), the program prints the current value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.
4. The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is a well-known optimization for primality testing.

The program correctly handles all potential cases because:

* It iterates over a sufficiently large range of values for `m` (up to 1000) to guarantee finding a counterexample for any given `n`.
* The `func_1` function correctly identifies prime numbers by checking for divisibility up to the square root of the number.
* The program stops as soon as it finds a counterexample, which is the smallest `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis and handles all potential cases, it is correct.
