Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It iterates through possible values of `m` and checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds a value of `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints that value and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly checks if a given number is prime by iterating through possible divisors from 2 to the square root of the number. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If it does not find any divisors, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as numbers less than 2, which are not considered prime.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For example, when `n = 3`, the program correctly outputs `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number. When `n = 4`, the program correctly outputs `2` because `4*1 + 1 = 5` is a prime number, but `4*2 + 1 = 9` is not.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis and correctly handles all possible cases.
