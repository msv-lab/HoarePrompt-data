Correctness: **False**

The issue with this program is that the function `func_1(num)` is called before it's defined. In Python, the functions need to be defined before they're used. This will cause a `NameError` because the interpreter doesn't recognize `func_1` when it's first called.

To fix this issue, the function `func_1(num)` should be defined before the `for` loop where it's used. The corrected code would look something like this:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```

Now, this program will correctly find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given `n`. It iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checks if `n * m + 1` is a prime number. If it finds a composite number, it prints the corresponding value of `m` and stops.
