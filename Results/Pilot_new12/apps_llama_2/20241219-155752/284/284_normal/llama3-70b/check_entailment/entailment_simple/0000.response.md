Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The task is to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that for any positive integer n, there exists a positive integer m such that n·m + 1 is a prime number. The program is designed to find an m such that n·m + 1 is not a prime number.

Here's a breakdown of how the program achieves this:

1. It takes an integer n as input.
2. It iterates over all possible values of m from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
3. For each m, it calculates n·m + 1 and checks if it is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
4. If n·m + 1 is not a prime number (i.e., `func_1` returns False), it prints the value of m and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime by:

1. Returning False if the number is less than 2 (since prime numbers are greater than 1).
2. Iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if it has any divisors. If it does, it returns False.
3. If the number has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.

The program is correct because it:

* Iterates over all possible values of m from 1 to 1000, ensuring that it will find a counterexample if one exists.
* Uses a correct primality test (`func_1`) to check if n·m + 1 is a prime number.
* Prints the value of m as soon as it finds a counterexample, which meets the problem description's requirements.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, and its output will always be a valid counterexample if one exists.
