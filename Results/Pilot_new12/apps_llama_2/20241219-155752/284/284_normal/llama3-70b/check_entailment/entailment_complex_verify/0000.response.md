Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to make sense. The program accurately implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis by iterating over possible values of `m` and checking if `n * m + 1` is prime using the `func_1` function. 

The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment. It provides a detailed description of the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior. The annotations confirm that the `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.

One potential issue with the original code is that the function `func_1` is called before it is defined. However, in Python, the function definition is hoisted to the top of the scope, so this is not an issue in this case.

Based on the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program correctly handles all potential cases. It iterates over a sufficiently large range of values for `m` (up to 1000) to guarantee finding a counterexample for any given `n`. The `func_1` function correctly identifies prime numbers by checking for divisibility up to the square root of the number. The program stops as soon as it finds a counterexample, which is the smallest `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct. 

Final: **True**
