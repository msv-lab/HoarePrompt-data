Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem statement asks to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that for any positive integer `n`, there exists a positive integer `m` such that `n*m + 1` is a prime number. The program is required to find an `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The program works as follows:

1. It reads an input `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
2. It iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
3. For each `m`, it checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
4. If `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly checks if a given number is prime by:

1. Returning `False` if the number is less than 2.
2. Iterating through possible divisors from 2 to the square root of the number.
3. Returning `False` if a divisor is found.
4. Returning `True` if no divisors are found.

The program is guaranteed to find an `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, because for any `n`, there exists an `m` such that `n*m + 1` is a multiple of a number less than or equal to `m`. For example, if `n` is 3, `m` can be 1, because `3*1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number. If `n` is 4, `m` can be 2, because `4*2 + 1 = 9`, which is not a prime number.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description and will always find an `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, making it a correct solution.
