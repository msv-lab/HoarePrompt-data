#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 1000.
def func_1(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 1000, and num is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the square root of `num` (or the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `num`), and if the function hasn't returned `False`, it implies `num` is a prime number, though the loop itself doesn't explicitly return or set a variable to this effect.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that 'num' is a prime number, where 'num' is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given positive integer `num` between 1 and 1000 is a prime number and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. It specifically returns `False` for input values less than 2. The function iterates through possible divisors from 2 to the square root of `num` and returns `False` as soon as it finds a divisor, indicating `num` is not prime. If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating `num` is prime. The function handles edge cases by returning `False` for numbers less than 2, implicitly covering the case for 1, which is not considered a prime number. The final state of the program after it concludes is either returning `True` to confirm `num` as a prime number or `False` to indicate it is not, based on the conditions checked during the function's execution.
