Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a program that finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which is to find a value of `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The program uses a function `func_1` to check if a given number is prime. This function first checks for edge cases where the number is less than or equal to 1 (in which case it returns `False`), and where the number is less than or equal to 3 (in which case it returns `True` if the number is 2 or 3). It then checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if so.

For larger values of the number, the function checks divisibility by prime numbers of the form 6k Â± 1, starting from 5 and 7, and returns `False` if the number is divisible by any of these primes. If the number passes all these checks, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is a prime number.

The main part of the program iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000, and for each `m`, it checks if `n*m + 1` is not a prime number using the `func_1` function. As soon as it finds such an `m`, it prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The program is guaranteed to find a counterexample because, according to the problem description, a counterexample is guaranteed to exist. The program's use of the `func_1` function to check for primality ensures that it correctly identifies when `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, and its iteration over all possible values of `m` ensures that it will find the first such counterexample.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says: it finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis by finding a value of `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.
