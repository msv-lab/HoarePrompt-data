Based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, I will analyze the program's correctness.

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is being called before it is defined, which is a valid concern. However, the corrected code moves the function definition above the line where it is being called, which resolves this issue.

The output hints provide a detailed explanation of the function `func_1` and how it checks for primality. The function appears to be correctly implemented, checking for edge cases, divisibility by 2 and 3, and then checking for divisibility by prime numbers of the form 6k ± 1.

Given the corrected code and the output hints, I believe that the program is correctly implemented to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis. The program iterates over values of `m` and checks if `n·m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds a value of `m` for which `n·m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints that value of `m` and breaks the loop.

Therefore, I change the original assessment and conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True** 

The reason for this conclusion is that the corrected code resolves the issue of the function being called before it is defined, and the output hints confirm that the `func_1` function is correctly implemented to check for primality. The program's logic is sound, and it should correctly find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis.
