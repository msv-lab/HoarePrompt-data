Correctness: **True**

The code appears to correctly implement the task of finding a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. It takes an input `n` and checks for each `m` in the range 1 to 1000 if `n*m + 1` is not a prime number. If it finds such an `m`, it prints the value of `m` and stops.

The function `func_1` checks if a given number is prime, and it handles all potential edge cases correctly. It first checks for numbers less than or equal to 1, then for numbers less than or equal to 3, and then for larger numbers, it checks divisibility by 2, 3, and prime numbers of the form 6k Â± 1.

The code also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For `n = 3`, it outputs `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4` is not a prime number. For `n = 4`, it outputs `2` because `4*2 + 1 = 9` is not a prime number.

The output hints provide a detailed description of the `func_1` function and its behavior, which matches the actual implementation of the function. The hints do not mention any cases where the function would not work correctly.

Since the code correctly implements the task and handles all potential edge cases, and there are no examples or hints that suggest otherwise, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
