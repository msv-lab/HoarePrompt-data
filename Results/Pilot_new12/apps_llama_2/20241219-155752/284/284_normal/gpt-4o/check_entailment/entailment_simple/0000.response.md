Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task described in the problem description. It finds a counterexample for the given hypothesis by iterating over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 and checking if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. As soon as it finds an `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, it prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime. It handles the base cases where `x` is less than or equal to 1 or less than or equal to 3, and then checks if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3. If `x` is not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks if `x` is divisible by any prime numbers of the form 6k + 1 or 6k + 5, where `k` is a positive integer.

The loop in the `func_1` function runs until `i * i` is greater than `x`, which is an optimization to reduce the number of iterations. This is because a larger factor of `x` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

Since the input `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and the program correctly checks all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000, it is guaranteed to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis.

For example, when `n = 3`, the program checks `n * 1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number, so it prints `1`. When `n = 4`, the program checks `n * 1 + 1 = 5`, which is a prime number, so it checks `n * 2 + 1 = 9`, which is not a prime number, so it prints `2`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the task described in the problem description and is guaranteed to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis.
