Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a given positive integer is a prime number, and the main part of the code iterates through values of `m` to find the first one where `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The function `func_1` correctly handles all potential edge cases, including numbers less than or equal to 1, numbers less than or equal to 3, and numbers divisible by 2 or 3. It also correctly checks divisibility by prime numbers of the form 6k Â± 1, which is an efficient way to check for primality.

The main part of the code correctly iterates through values of `m` and uses the `func_1` function to check if `n*m + 1` is a prime number. It stops as soon as it finds a value of `m` where `n*m + 1` is not a prime number and prints this value of `m`.

The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code. For example, when `n` is 3, the code correctly outputs `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number. When `n` is 4, the code correctly outputs `2` because `4*1 + 1 = 5` is a prime number, but `4*2 + 1 = 9` is not.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
