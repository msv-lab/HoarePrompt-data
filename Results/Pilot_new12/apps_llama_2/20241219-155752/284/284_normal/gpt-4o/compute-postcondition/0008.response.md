To calculate the postcondition, we first need to understand the given precondition and the if condition. The precondition states that `x` is a positive integer with specific constraints: `1 <= x <= 1000`, `x > 1`, and `x > 3`. This means `x` must be at least 4 and at most 1000. The if condition is `x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0`, which means `x` is either divisible by 2 or by 3.

To find the postcondition when the program does not enter the if block (i.e., it enters the else block), we need to negate the if condition. The negation of `x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0` is `x % 2!= 0 and x % 3!= 0`, meaning `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3.

Given the constraints from the precondition and adding the negation of the if condition, the postcondition would include all the initial constraints on `x` plus the condition that `x` is not divisible by either 2 or 3.

Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer such that `1 <= x <= 1000`, `x` is greater than 1, `x` is larger than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3.**
