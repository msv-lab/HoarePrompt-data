The value of `i` is incremented by 6. Initially, `i` is 5, so after the increment, `i` becomes 11. The states of the other variables are not affected. `x` is still at least 25, neither divisible by 2 nor by 3. Also, the conditions that `x` modulo 5 is not 0 and `x` modulo 7 is not 0 are still valid, but now we also know that `x` modulo `i` (which is now 11) could be any value since we don't have information about `x` modulo 11.

Output State: **`x` is at least 25, `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3, `x` modulo 5 is not 0, `x` modulo 7 is not 0, and `i` is 11**
