To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is `i * i <= x`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is at least 25
- `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3
- `x` modulo 5 is not 0
- `x` modulo 7 is not 0
- `i` is 11

The loop condition `i * i <= x` depends on the values of `i` and `x`. Since `i` is 11, `i * i = 121`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than or equal to 121 because the condition is `i * i <= x`.

Adjusting the state:
- The condition that `x` is at least 25 is not sufficient for the loop to continue because `i * i` (121) is greater than 25. 
- The conditions about `x` not being divisible by 2, 3, and its modulo 5 and 7 not being 0 do not directly affect the loop condition but describe properties of `x`.
- Since `i` is 11, and we want the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least 121 to satisfy `i * i <= x`.

So, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute one more time is:
State: **`x` must be at least 121, `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3, `x` modulo 5 is not 0, `x` modulo 7 is not 0, and `i` is 11**
