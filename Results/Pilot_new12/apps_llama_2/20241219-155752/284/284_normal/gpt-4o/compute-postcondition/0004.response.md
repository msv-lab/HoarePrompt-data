Given the initial state, we know that `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 1000, `x` is greater than 1, and `x` is less than or equal to 3. This means `x` can only be 2 or 3. 

The code snippet is `return True`, which means it returns a boolean value of True regardless of the value of `x`.

Output State: **The program returns True**
