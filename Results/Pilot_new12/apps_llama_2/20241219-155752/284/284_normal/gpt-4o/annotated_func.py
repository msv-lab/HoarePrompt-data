    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is a positive integer such that `1 <= x <= 1000`, `x` is greater than 1, `x` is larger than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given positive integer `x` between 1 and 1000 is a prime number and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The function first checks for edge cases where `x` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False`, and where `x` is less than or equal to 3, in which case it returns `True` if `x` is 2 or 3. It then checks if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning `False` if so. For larger values of `x`, it checks divisibility by prime numbers of the form 6k Â± 1, starting from 5 and 7, and returns `False` if `x` is divisible by any of these primes. If `x` passes all these checks, the function returns `True`, indicating that `x` is a prime number. The function handles all potential edge cases, including numbers less than or equal to 1, numbers less than or equal to 3, and numbers divisible by 2 or 3, as well as larger prime and composite numbers.
