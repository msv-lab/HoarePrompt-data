The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bits` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. 

Before this line of code, `smallest` was equal to the second last element of the original `bits` which is one of the indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, minus 1. Now `smallest` will be the last element of `bits` which was `smallest - 1`. So the new value of `smallest` is `smallest - 1`.

The length of `bits` is decreased by 1.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` length is less than `k` and is one less than before, the last element of `bits` is `smallest - 1` (the second last element of the new `bits`), `i` is -1, `smallest` is equal to `smallest - 1`**
