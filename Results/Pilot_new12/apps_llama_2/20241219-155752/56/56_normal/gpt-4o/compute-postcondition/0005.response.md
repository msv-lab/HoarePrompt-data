Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is an empty list, `i` is 60. The current value of the 61st bit of `n` (since indexing starts at 0 and `i` is 60) is 1, indicating that the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `n` is set to 1.**
