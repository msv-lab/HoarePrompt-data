Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, in the order they appear from most significant to least significant. The current value of `bits` has more than `k` elements and `i` is -1 if the loop executed, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, and the current state of `bits` and `n` is such that `bits` is an empty list if the current value of `n` is 0**
