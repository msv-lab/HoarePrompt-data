To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `len(bits) < k`.

Given that:
- `n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18
- `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5
- `k` is less than or equal to original `n`
- `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, in the order they appear from most significant to least significant
- `i` is -1 if the loop executed, otherwise `i` remains unchanged
- `bits` is an empty list if `n` is 0
- The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`

The condition for the loop to execute is that the length of `bits` must be less than `k`. Since we're given that the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that it's not already equal to `k` but rather less than `k`.

However, given the constraints, if `k` is less than or equal to the number of bits set in `n` (which is what `bits` represents), and considering that `bits` cannot have more elements than `k` according to the given constraints, the only way for the loop to not execute is if `bits` already has `k` elements or if `n` is such that it doesn't allow for `k` bits to be set (which contradicts the given constraints since `k` is less than or equal to original `n`).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must adjust the states so that `len(bits)` is indeed less than `k`, which means we need to ensure that the original `n` has enough bits set (but not necessarily all set) such that the length of `bits` can be less than `k` initially.

Given that `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in `n` that are 1 and its length is less than or equal to `k`, and considering the constraints on `n` and `k`, the only adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is to ensure that `len(bits)` is strictly less than `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1 and its length is strictly less than `k`, `i` is -1 if the loop executed, otherwise `i` remains unchanged**
