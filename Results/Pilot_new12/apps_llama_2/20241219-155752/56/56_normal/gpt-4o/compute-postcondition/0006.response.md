To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the code's impact on the variables and their initial states.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 10^18.
   - `k` is an integer, where 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `bits` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 60.
   - The 61st bit of `n` (since indexing starts at 0 and `i` is 60) is 1.

2. **Code Execution**: `bits.append(i)`

This line of code appends the value of `i` to the `bits` list. Given that `i` is 60, this means the number 60 will be added to the `bits` list.

3. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains an integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 10^18.
   - `k` remains an integer, where 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `bits` is a list containing the value 60, i.e., `bits` = [60].
   - `i` remains 60.
   - The 61st bit of `n` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` = [60], `i` is 60, and the 61st bit of `n` is 1.**
