According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the loop. The loop will iterate from 60 to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. The loop variable `i` will start at 60.

State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is an empty list, `i` is 60**
