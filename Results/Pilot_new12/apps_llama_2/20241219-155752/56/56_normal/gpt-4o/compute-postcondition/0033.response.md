The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer ranging from 1 to 10^18 and `k` is an integer ranging from 1 to 10^5. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The function returns the string 'No'.
Case_2: The function returns the string 'No'.
Case_3: The function returns a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of all elements in the `bits` list, which is a sorted list in descending order with length `k`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and return either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a sorted list of `k` elements.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, returns either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a sorted list of k elements.**
