Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 59, if the 61st bit of `n` is 1, then if the 60th bit of `n` is 1, `bits` = [60, 59], otherwise `bits` = [60], if the 61st bit of `n` is 0, then if the 60th bit of `n` is 1, `bits` = [59], otherwise `bits` is an empty list**
