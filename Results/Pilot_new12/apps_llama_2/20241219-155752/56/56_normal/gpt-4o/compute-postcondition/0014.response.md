To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    if n >> i & 1:
        bits.append(i)
```
This loop iterates over the range of numbers from 60 to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if the `i`-th bit of the number `n` is 1. If it is, it appends `i` to the `bits` list.

The output states for the first few iterations suggest that the loop is checking the bits of the number `n` from most significant to least significant. The `bits` list stores the indices of the bits that are 1.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `bits` list will contain the indices of all the bits in `n` that are 1, in the order they were encountered (from most significant to least significant). The `i` variable will be -1, since that is the last value it takes on in the loop.

Note that the value of `k` is not affected by the loop, and the loop will execute regardless of the value of `k`.

If `n` is 0, the loop will not append any values to the `bits` list, since none of the bits of 0 are 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, in the order they appear from most significant to least significant, `i` is -1 if the loop executed, otherwise `i` remains unchanged and `bits` is an empty list if `n` is 0.**
