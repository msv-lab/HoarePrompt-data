According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop iterates in reverse order (from 60 to -1), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 60. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be 59.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `bits` do not affect the loop's execution, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, if the 61st bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` = [60] and `i` is 59, otherwise `bits` is an empty list and `i` is 59**
