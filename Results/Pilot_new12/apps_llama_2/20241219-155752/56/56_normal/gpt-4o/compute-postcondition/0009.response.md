To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18
- `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5
- `k` is less than or equal to `n`
- If the 61st bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` = [60] and `i` is 59
- Otherwise, `bits` is an empty list and `i` is 59

Given Code:
```python
bits.append(i)
```

This code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`.

Analysis:
- The value of `n` does not change.
- The value of `k` does not change.
- The relationship between `k` and `n` remains unchanged (`k` is less than or equal to `n`).
- The value of `i` is 59, whether the 61st bit of `n` is 1 or not. So, `i` is always 59.
- `bits` changes based on its initial state:
  - If the 61st bit of `n` is 1, initially `bits` = [60]. After executing `bits.append(i)`, `bits` becomes [60, 59].
  - If the 61st bit of `n` is not 1, initially `bits` is an empty list. After executing `bits.append(i)`, `bits` becomes [59].

Output State:
Given that `i` is always 59 and `bits` changes by appending `i` to it, regardless of the initial condition regarding the 61st bit of `n`, the updated list `bits` will either be [60, 59] if the 61st bit of `n` is 1 or [59] if it's not. The rest of the conditions regarding `n`, `k`, and their relationship remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 59, if the 61st bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` = [60, 59], otherwise `bits` = [59]**
