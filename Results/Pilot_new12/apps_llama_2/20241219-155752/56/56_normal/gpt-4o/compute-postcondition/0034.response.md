Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 10^18`, and `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 10^5`. It returns either the string 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it returns a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by a sorted list of `k` elements, which represents the indices of bits in `n` modified to have exactly `k` bits set. The function modifies the bits of `n` by duplicating the smallest bit until `k` bits are reached, and then returns the sorted list of modified bit indices. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or `k` is 1, and ensures that the returned list has exactly `k` elements.**
