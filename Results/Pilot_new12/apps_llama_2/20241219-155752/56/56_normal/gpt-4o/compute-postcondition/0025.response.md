The code appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list. The last element of `bits` before this operation was `smallest - 1`, so after this operation, the last two elements of `bits` will be the same, both being `smallest - 1`. The length of `bits` increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` length is less than or equal to `k` and increased by 1, the last two elements of `bits` are `smallest - 1`, `i` is -1, `smallest` is equal to the second last element of the original `bits` which is one of the indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, minus 1**
