The code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. The initial state of `n`, `k`, and the relationship between them are not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is 58 and it is appended to `bits`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 1 <= `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58, `bits` is a list containing the value 58**
