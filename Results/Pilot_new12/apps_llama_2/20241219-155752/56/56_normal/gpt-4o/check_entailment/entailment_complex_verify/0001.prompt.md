You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input number `n` is not an integer power of 2, but its binary representation has more than `k` bits set. 

For example, consider the input `n = 11` and `k = 3`. The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which has `3` bits set. The program will try to add more bits by splitting the smallest bit, but this will result in negative numbers, which is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the integers should be such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals `n`. 

The program will not be able to find a solution for this case because it will try to split the smallest bit, but this will not result in a valid solution.

In this case, the program should return 'No' because there is no valid solution that meets the conditions specified in the problem statement. However, the program will return an incorrect solution.

To fix this, the program should check if the number `n` can be represented as a sum of `k` integer powers of 2 before trying to split bits. 

Here is an example of an input that the program does not handle correctly:

Input:
```
11 3
```
The program will return 'Yes' followed by an incorrect solution, but the correct output should be 'No' because there is no valid solution that meets the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

This shows that the program is not correct and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer and 1 <= k <= 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns the string 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer and 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer and 1 <= k <= 10^5, and k is less than or equal to n
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, in the order they appear from most significant to least significant, `i` is -1 if the loop executed, otherwise `i` remains unchanged and `bits` is an empty list if `n` is 0.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns the string 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer and 1 <= original `n` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer and 1 <= `k` <= 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to original `n`, `bits` is a list of indices of the bits in original `n` that are 1, in the order they appear from most significant to least significant, `i` is -1 if the loop executed, otherwise `i` remains unchanged and `bits` is an empty list if `n` is 0, and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `bits` length is `k`, `i` is -1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their original values
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of all elements in the `bits` list, which is a sorted list in descending order with length `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 10^18`, and `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 10^5`. It returns either the string 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it returns a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by a sorted list of `k` elements, which represents the indices of bits in `n` modified to have exactly `k` bits set. The function modifies the bits of `n` by duplicating the smallest bit until `k` bits are reached, and then returns the sorted list of modified bit indices. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or `k` is 1, and ensures that the returned list has exactly `k` elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
