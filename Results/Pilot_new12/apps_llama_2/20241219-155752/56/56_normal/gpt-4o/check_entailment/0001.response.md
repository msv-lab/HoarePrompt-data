Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input number `n` is not an integer power of 2, but its binary representation has more than `k` bits set. 

For example, consider the input `n = 11` and `k = 3`. The binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which has `3` bits set. The program will try to add more bits by splitting the smallest bit, but this will result in negative numbers, which is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the integers should be such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals `n`. 

The program will not be able to find a solution for this case because it will try to split the smallest bit, but this will not result in a valid solution.

In this case, the program should return 'No' because there is no valid solution that meets the conditions specified in the problem statement. However, the program will return an incorrect solution.

To fix this, the program should check if the number `n` can be represented as a sum of `k` integer powers of 2 before trying to split bits. 

Here is an example of an input that the program does not handle correctly:

Input:
```
11 3
```
The program will return 'Yes' followed by an incorrect solution, but the correct output should be 'No' because there is no valid solution that meets the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

This shows that the program is not correct and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
