Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It uses a bit manipulation approach to find the powers of 2 that sum up to the given number `n`. The program first checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns 'No' because it's impossible to find `k` powers of 2 that sum up to `n`. 

Then, it iterates over the bits of `n` from most significant to least significant and checks if the bit is set. If the bit is set, it adds the corresponding power of 2 to the `bits` list. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns 'No' because it's impossible to find a sequence of `k` powers of 2 that sum up to `n`.

If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, it repeatedly pops the smallest power of 2 from `bits`, decrements it by 1, and adds two copies of the decremented power of 2 back to `bits`. This process continues until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`.

Finally, it sorts `bits` in descending order and returns the result as a string. The `bits` list represents the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, and the sorting ensures that the sequence is lexicographically largest.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where `k` is 1 or `n` is 0. The use of bit manipulation and the sorting step ensure that the program produces the correct result for all valid inputs. 

One potential issue could be the use of a fixed-size loop (60 iterations) to iterate over the bits of `n`. However, since `n` is guaranteed to be at most 10^18, which has at most 60 bits, this is not a problem in practice. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program appears to be correct, and I couldn't find any potential case where it doesn't work as expected.
