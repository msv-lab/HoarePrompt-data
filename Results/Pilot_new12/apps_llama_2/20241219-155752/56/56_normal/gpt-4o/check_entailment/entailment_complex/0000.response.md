Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Handling the case when k > n**: The program first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If this condition is true, it returns 'No', as it's impossible to find `k` integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`.

2. **Finding the bits of n**: The program then finds the bits of `n` that are set to 1 by iterating over all possible bits (from most significant to least significant) and checking if the bit is set using the expression `n >> i & 1`.

3. **Checking if the number of bits is greater than k**: If the number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`, the program returns 'No', as it's impossible to find `k` integers that satisfy the condition.

4. **Modifying the bits to have exactly k bits set**: If the number of bits set in `n` is less than `k`, the program modifies the bits by duplicating the smallest bit until `k` bits are reached.

5. **Returning the result**: Finally, the program returns a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by the sorted list of modified bit indices in descending order.

The program ensures that the returned list has exactly `k` elements and handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or `k` is 1.

The program's approach is correct because it:

* Handles all possible cases where `k` is greater than `n` or the number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`.
* Modifies the bits of `n` to have exactly `k` bits set by duplicating the smallest bit, which ensures that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`.
* Returns the sorted list of modified bit indices in descending order, which satisfies the condition of having the lexicographically largest sequence.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem described, and it handles all possible cases.
