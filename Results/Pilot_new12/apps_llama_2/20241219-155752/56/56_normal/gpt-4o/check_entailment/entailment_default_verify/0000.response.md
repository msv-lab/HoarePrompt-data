Based on the provided code and problem description, I believe the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the bit manipulation approach to find the powers of 2 that sum up to the given number `n`. It handles edge cases where `k` is greater than `n`, and where the number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`.

The output hints provide additional insight into the code's functionality and confirm that it behaves as expected. The hints indicate that the function returns either 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set in `n` is greater than `k`, or a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by a sorted list of `k` elements, which represents the indices of bits in `n` modified to have exactly `k` bits set.

I did not find any evidence in the output hints or the problem description that would suggest the original assessment is incorrect. The code's approach to modifying the bits of `n` by duplicating the smallest bit until `k` bits are reached, and then returning the sorted list of modified bit indices, aligns with the problem description's requirements.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
