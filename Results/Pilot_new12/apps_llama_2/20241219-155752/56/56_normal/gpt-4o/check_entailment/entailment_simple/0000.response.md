Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program checks if `k > n`, and if so, returns 'No'. This is correct because if `k` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to find `k` integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`.

2. The program then converts `n` to binary and stores the indices of the bits that are 1 in the `bits` list. This is a clever way to represent the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`.

3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because it means that `n` cannot be represented as the sum of `k` powers of 2.

4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the program repeatedly popes the smallest element from `bits`, decrements it by 1, and appends two copies of the decremented value back to `bits`. This process continues until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`. This is a correct way to find the lexicographically largest sequence of `k` integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`.

5. Finally, the program sorts `bits` in descending order and returns a string that starts with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of all elements in `bits`. This is correct because it produces the required output format.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `k > n` or `len(bits) > k`. It also produces the lexicographically largest sequence of `k` integers, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
