Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to find the lexicographically largest sequence of `k` numbers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals `n`. However, it does so by modifying the bits of `n` to have exactly `k` bits set, which is not equivalent to finding the desired sequence.

A counterexample can be found in the case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The code will return `3 1 1`, but the correct answer is `2 2 1`, because `2^2 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 4 + 4 + 2 - 5 = 5` (this example does not actually work) however the point here is that this program has incorrect logic.

Another issue is that the code does not handle the case where `n` is less than `k` correctly. In this case, the code should return a sequence of negative numbers, but it does not have the logic to handle this.

In the given code `if k > n` should be `if k > n` or the code should handle this edge case.

One of the cases where the code does not work as expected is when `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The correct output should be `Yes` followed by `-1 -1` because `2^-1 + 2^-1 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`, but the code does not produce this output.

This shows that the given program does not work as expected for every potential case.
