Correctness: **False**.

The code provided seems to be incorrect. According to the problem description, we need to find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. The code, however, only checks if the number of bits set in n is greater than k and if so, returns 'No'. This approach does not consider all possible combinations of integers that could sum up to n.

Moreover, when the code tries to modify the bits of n by duplicating the smallest bit until k bits are reached, it does not ensure that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to n. For example, if n = 10 and k = 3, the code will return 'Yes\n3 2 1' which corresponds to the sum 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14, not 10.

The output hints agree with the code but they also help prove that the code is incorrect. The function returns either the string 'No' if k is greater than n or if the number of bits set in n is greater than k. However, this does not cover all possible cases where the sum of two to the power of each number equals to n.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem and there are potential cases where it will not work as expected. For instance, if n = 13 and k = 3, the code will return 'No' because the number of bits set in n (3) is less than k (3), but there is a possible solution 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 which the code does not consider. 

Hence, the correctness of the code is **False**.
