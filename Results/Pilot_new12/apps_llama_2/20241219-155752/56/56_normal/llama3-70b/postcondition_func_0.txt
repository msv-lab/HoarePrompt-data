The function accepts two input integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5. It determines whether `n` can be represented as the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2. If `n` is less than `k` or if `n` cannot be represented as the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' and the `k` largest powers of 2 that sum up to `n` in descending order. The function modifies the input variables `n` and `k` are not modified outside of the function, but the variables `a` and `i` are used internally to store the powers of 2 and the iteration count, respectively. After the function concludes, `n` is either unchanged or reduced to 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a sorted list of `k` powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the console.
