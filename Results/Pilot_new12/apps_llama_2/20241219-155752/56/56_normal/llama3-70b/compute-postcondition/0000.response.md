The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` by taking an input, splitting it into two parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning the results to `n` and `k`, respectively.

The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5. However, the code updates these values based on the input provided.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `n` and `k` after the input has been processed. Since `map(int, input().split())` assigns the first integer from the input to `n` and the second integer to `k`, the updated values of `n` and `k` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
