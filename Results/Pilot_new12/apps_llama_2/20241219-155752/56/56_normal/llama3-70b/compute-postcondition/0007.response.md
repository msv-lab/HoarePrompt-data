The value of `x` is assigned as `n.bit_length() - 1`, where `n.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary. The initial state of `n` is that it is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, and `i` is 0. The states of `k`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
