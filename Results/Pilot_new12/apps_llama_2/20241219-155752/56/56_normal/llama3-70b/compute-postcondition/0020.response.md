The initial state is given as `n` is `n - 2`. However, this seems to be a contradictory or incomplete definition, as `n` cannot be equal to `n - 2` unless `n` is 0 or the statement is partially incorrect or misleading. Assuming there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication in the problem statement regarding `n`'s initial state, and taking the equation `n = n - 2` at face value, if `n` were to be a specific value initially, this equation would not hold true for any `n` other than 0 because it implies `n` must equal itself minus 2, which only works if `n` is 0 (since 0 = 0 - 2 is not true, this is a contradiction). However, to proceed with the task as instructed:

Given the operation `i += 1`, we are increasing the value of `i` by 1. 

The initial state's description of `n` appears to be nonsensical as given (`n` is `n - 2` would only be true if `n` equals 0, but even then, it doesn't make sense as an initial condition without further context). Assuming `n` has some value (but acknowledging the initial condition seems flawed), and considering `i`'s operation:

Output State: **`n`'s value is contradictory or undefined based on the given initial state, `i` is increased by 1**
