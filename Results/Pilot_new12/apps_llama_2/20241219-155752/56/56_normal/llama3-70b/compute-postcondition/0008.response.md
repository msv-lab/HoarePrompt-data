Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, initially `i` was 0, but now the current value of `i` is such that it is greater than or equal to `x`, where `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`, meaning the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`**
