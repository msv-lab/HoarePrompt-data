Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, the string 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `n` is 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a list of `x` values where `x` was the bit length of `n` minus 1 at each iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than the bit length of the original `n` minus 1, and `k` remains the input integer. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `a` is a sorted list in descending order of `k` values, 'Yes' has been printed, and the elements of `a` have been printed.**
