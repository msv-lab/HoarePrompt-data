The given Python code prints the elements of list `a` separated by spaces. The code does not modify any variables, it only prints the values in list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a sorted list in descending order of `k` values where these values were the bit length of `n` minus 1 at each iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than the bit length of the original `n` minus 1, `k` remains the input integer, 'Yes' has been printed, and the elements of `a` have been printed.**
