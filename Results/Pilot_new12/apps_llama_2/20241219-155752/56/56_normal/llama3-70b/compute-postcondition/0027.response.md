The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state of `n` is given as `n - 2`, but without a specific value for `n`, we cannot determine a numerical value for `n`. However, we can express the new state of `n` as still being `n - 2` since the code does not modify `n`. The variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 2`, `i` is increased by 1**
