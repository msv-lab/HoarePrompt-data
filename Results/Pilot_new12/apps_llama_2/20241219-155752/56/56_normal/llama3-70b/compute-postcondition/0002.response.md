The given code snippet is a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. This statement does not modify the values of `n` and `k`. 

The value of `n` is still an input integer, and the value of `k` is still an input integer. The condition that the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k` remains unchanged.

The print statement simply outputs 'No' to the console, but it does not affect the values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and the string 'No' has been printed, `n` is less than `k`.**
