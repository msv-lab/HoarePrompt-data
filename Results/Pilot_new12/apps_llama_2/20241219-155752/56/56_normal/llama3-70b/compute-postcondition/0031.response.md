Postcondition: **`n` is 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a list of `x` values where `x` was the bit length of `n` minus 1 at each iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than the bit length of the original `n` minus 1, `k` remains the input integer, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`**
