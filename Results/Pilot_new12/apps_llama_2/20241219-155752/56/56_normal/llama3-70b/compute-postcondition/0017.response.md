Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list with `n.bit_length() - 1` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`, and if `x` is less than or equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues execution as there is no else part to handle the alternative condition.***
