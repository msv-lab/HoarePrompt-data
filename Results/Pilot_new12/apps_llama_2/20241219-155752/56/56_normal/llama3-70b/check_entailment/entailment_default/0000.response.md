Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code is attempting to find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. However, the current implementation does not consider all possible combinations of powers of 2 that sum up to n. 

The code starts by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n, and then subtracts this value from n. This process is repeated until n becomes 0 or the length of the list of powers of 2 exceeds k. However, this approach does not guarantee that the largest integer in the answer will be as small as possible, because it does not explore all possible combinations of powers of 2.

For example, if we have n = 11 and k = 3, the code will output 'No' because it cannot find 3 distinct powers of 2 that sum up to 11. However, a correct solution would be (3, 0, -1) because 2^3 + 2^0 + 2^-1 = 8 + 1 + 0.5 = 9.5 which is not correct but another combination 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 is correct.

The issue is that the code only considers powers of 2 that are distinct and non-negative, whereas the problem statement allows for non-negative and negative powers of 2. To fix this, we need to modify the code to explore all possible combinations of powers of 2, including non-negative and negative powers.

Another issue with the code is that it does not consider the case when n can be represented as the sum of k identical powers of 2. For example, if we have n = 4 and k = 2, the code will output 'No' because it cannot find 2 distinct powers of 2 that sum up to 4. However, a correct solution would be (1, 1) because 2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 = 4.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the code to explore all possible combinations of powers of 2, including non-negative and negative powers, and including identical powers of 2. We can do this by using a recursive approach that tries all possible combinations of powers of 2 and checks if they sum up to n. If they do, we update our solution if the maximum power of 2 in the current combination is smaller than the maximum power of 2 in our current solution. If we find a solution with the smallest possible maximum power of 2, we then sort the solution in descending order to get the lexicographically largest solution.
