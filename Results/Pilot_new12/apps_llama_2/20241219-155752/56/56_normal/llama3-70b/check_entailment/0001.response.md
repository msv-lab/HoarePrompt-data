Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue lies in the way it constructs the sequence of integers. The current implementation tries to find the largest powers of 2 that sum up to `n` and then takes the first `k` elements from this sequence, which may not necessarily result in the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum maximum value.

Here's a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
`15 3`

The program's output:
`Yes`
`3 1 0`

However, the correct output should be:
`Yes`
`2 2 1`

In this case, the program does not find the lexicographically largest sequence because it simply takes the first `k` elements from the sequence of largest powers of 2. To fix this, we need to modify the program to try all possible combinations of powers of 2 that sum up to `n` and then select the one that is lexicographically largest with the minimum maximum value.

Another case where the program does not work correctly is when the input `n` is less than `2^63-1` (the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit integer) but `n` cannot be represented exactly as a sum of `k` powers of 2. In this case, the program should output "No" but it does not handle this scenario correctly.

To correct these issues, we need to modify the program to check all possible combinations of powers of 2 and select the one that satisfies the conditions. We also need to add a check to handle cases where `n` cannot be represented exactly as a sum of `k` powers of 2. 

The main challenge in solving this problem lies in finding the correct sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to `n` while minimizing the maximum value in the sequence. A possible solution involves using a recursive approach or dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of powers of 2 and selecting the one that meets the conditions. 

However, given the constraints of the problem and the limitations of the current program, it is clear that the given program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case.
