You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. 

One potential issue with the program is that it does not consider the case when the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. The program simply generates a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to n, but it does not guarantee that the largest integer in the sequence is the smallest possible.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case when n and k are very large. The program uses a while loop to generate the sequence of powers of 2, but this loop can take a long time to terminate if n is very large.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is 1 and 2. The program outputs "No" because it cannot generate a sequence of two numbers that sum up to 1, but the correct output should be "Yes" with the sequence "-1 -1". However, the provided program actually works correctly for this case because it checks if n < k and prints 'No' in this case, but it does not work for other cases.

For example, if the input is 7 3, the program outputs "Yes" with the sequence "2 1 1", but this is not the lexicographically largest sequence with the smallest possible largest integer. The correct output should be "Yes" with the sequence "2 2 0".

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to generate all possible sequences of powers of 2 that sum up to n and then select the sequence with the smallest possible largest integer and the lexicographically largest sequence among those with the same largest integer.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18, and k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a list of `x` values where `x` was the bit length of `n` minus 1 at each iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than the bit length of the original `n` minus 1, and `k` remains the input integer.
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a list of `x` values where `x` was the bit length of `n` minus 1 at each iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than the bit length of the original `n` minus 1, and `k` remains the input integer. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `a` is a sorted list in descending order of `k` values, 'Yes' has been printed, and the elements of `a` have been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, the string 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `n` is 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a list of `x` values where `x` was the bit length of `n` minus 1 at each iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than the bit length of the original `n` minus 1, and `k` remains the input integer. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `a` is a sorted list in descending order of `k` values, 'Yes' has been printed, and the elements of `a` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two input integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5. It determines whether `n` can be represented as the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2. If `n` is less than `k` or if `n` cannot be represented as the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' and the `k` largest powers of 2 that sum up to `n` in descending order. The function modifies the input variables `n` and `k` are not modified outside of the function, but the variables `a` and `i` are used internally to store the powers of 2 and the iteration count, respectively. After the function concludes, `n` is either unchanged or reduced to 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a sorted list of `k` powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the console.
