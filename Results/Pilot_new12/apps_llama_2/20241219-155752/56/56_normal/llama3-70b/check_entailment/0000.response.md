Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. 

One potential issue with the program is that it does not consider the case when the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. The program simply generates a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to n, but it does not guarantee that the largest integer in the sequence is the smallest possible.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle the case when n and k are very large. The program uses a while loop to generate the sequence of powers of 2, but this loop can take a long time to terminate if n is very large.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is 1 and 2. The program outputs "No" because it cannot generate a sequence of two numbers that sum up to 1, but the correct output should be "Yes" with the sequence "-1 -1". However, the provided program actually works correctly for this case because it checks if n < k and prints 'No' in this case, but it does not work for other cases.

For example, if the input is 7 3, the program outputs "Yes" with the sequence "2 1 1", but this is not the lexicographically largest sequence with the smallest possible largest integer. The correct output should be "Yes" with the sequence "2 2 0".

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to generate all possible sequences of powers of 2 that sum up to n and then select the sequence with the smallest possible largest integer and the lexicographically largest sequence among those with the same largest integer.
