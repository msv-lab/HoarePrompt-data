Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The main issue with the code is that it does not handle the case when the input `n` can be represented as a sum of powers of 2, but the largest power of 2 in this representation is greater than the maximum possible value that can be achieved by filling the rest of the sequence with the smallest possible powers of 2. 

For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the code will print 'No' because it cannot find a sequence of 3 distinct powers of 2 that sum up to 10. However, the correct solution is `4 2 -1` (since `2^4 + 2^2 + 2^-1 = 16 + 4 + 1/2 = 20.5`, which is not a correct solution, the correct solution is `2 2 -1` doesn't work either because  `2^2 + 2^2 + 2^-1 = 4 + 4 + 1/2 = 8.5`, which is not a correct solution), actually, a correct solution can be found:  `3 1 1`, since `2^3 + 2^1 + 2^1 = 8 + 2 + 2 = 12`, which is not a correct solution, the problem description requires to find `k` integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number `n`. So, a correct solution for `n = 10` and `k = 3` is actually `3 1 0` (since `2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 2 + 0 = 10`).

This issue arises because the code does not correctly implement the problem's requirement to find the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum maximum value.

Here is a counterexample:
Input:
10 3
Code output: No
Expected output: Yes
3 1 0 
The provided counterexample shows that the code does not work correctly in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
