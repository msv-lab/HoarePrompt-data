You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue lies in the way it constructs the sequence of integers. The current implementation tries to find the largest powers of 2 that sum up to `n` and then takes the first `k` elements from this sequence, which may not necessarily result in the lexicographically largest sequence with the minimum maximum value.

Here's a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
`15 3`

The program's output:
`Yes`
`3 1 0`

However, the correct output should be:
`Yes`
`2 2 1`

In this case, the program does not find the lexicographically largest sequence because it simply takes the first `k` elements from the sequence of largest powers of 2. To fix this, we need to modify the program to try all possible combinations of powers of 2 that sum up to `n` and then select the one that is lexicographically largest with the minimum maximum value.

Another case where the program does not work correctly is when the input `n` is less than `2^63-1` (the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit integer) but `n` cannot be represented exactly as a sum of `k` powers of 2. In this case, the program should output "No" but it does not handle this scenario correctly.

To correct these issues, we need to modify the program to check all possible combinations of powers of 2 and select the one that satisfies the conditions. We also need to add a check to handle cases where `n` cannot be represented exactly as a sum of `k` powers of 2. 

The main challenge in solving this problem lies in finding the correct sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to `n` while minimizing the maximum value in the sequence. A possible solution involves using a recursive approach or dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of powers of 2 and selecting the one that meets the conditions. 

However, given the constraints of the problem and the limitations of the current program, it is clear that the given program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two input integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^5. It determines whether `n` can be represented as the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2. If `n` is less than `k` or if `n` cannot be represented as the sum of `k` distinct powers of 2, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' and the `k` largest powers of 2 that sum up to `n` in descending order. The function modifies the input variables `n` and `k` are not modified outside of the function, but the variables `a` and `i` are used internally to store the powers of 2 and the iteration count, respectively. After the function concludes, `n` is either unchanged or reduced to 0 if the loop executed at least once, `a` contains a sorted list of `k` powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
