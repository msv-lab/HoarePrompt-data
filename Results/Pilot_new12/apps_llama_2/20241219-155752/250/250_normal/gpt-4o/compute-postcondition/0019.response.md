Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `mark` is the second mark in the list. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True` and if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`. If neither `mark + y` nor `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
