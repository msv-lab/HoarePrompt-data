The code sets `y_found` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are still integers, `marks` is still a list of input integers with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is still a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, and `mark` is still the second mark in the list. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is still `True`. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `mark` is the second mark in the list, `y_found` is `True`, and if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`.**
