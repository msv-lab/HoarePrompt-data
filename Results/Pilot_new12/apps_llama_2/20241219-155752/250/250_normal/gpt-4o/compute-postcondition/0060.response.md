`new_marks` is updated by adding `mark - y`. The previous conditions for `new_marks` are still valid, so `new_marks` can contain `mark + x`, `mark - x`, or be undefined. Now, `new_marks` also contains `mark - y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in the list. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark + x` and `mark - y`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set` and none of the above conditions are met, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x` and `mark - y`. If none of the above conditions are met, `new_marks` contains `mark - y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in the list. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least `mark + x` and `mark - y`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set` and none of the above conditions are met, then `new_marks` contains at least `mark - x` and `mark - y`. If none of the above conditions are met, `new_marks` contains at least `mark - y`.**
