Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `mark` is the first mark in the list. The current value of `mark` is such that either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is present in `marks_set`.**
