According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 1 mark, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` being integers, `marks_set` being a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` being boolean values, and `new_marks` being an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute, `marks` must have at least 1 mark, and `mark` should be the first mark in the list. 

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is True if any mark's `x` offset is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`, either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), `new_marks` is an empty set, `mark` is the first mark in the list**
