The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or the if statement that we are directly inside. In this case, since there are no changes made to the variables, their values remain the same. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `x_found` or `y_found`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
