The code adds `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. Since at least one of the conditions `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` is true, the value of `mark + y` is added to `new_marks`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` is a set that contains either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, and `mark + y` based on previous conditions.**
