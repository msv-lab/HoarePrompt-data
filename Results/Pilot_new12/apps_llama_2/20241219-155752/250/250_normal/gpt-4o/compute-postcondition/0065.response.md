To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state provides that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, and `mark` is the third mark in the list.

The given code is `new_marks.add(mark + x)`. This line of code adds the sum of `mark` and `x` to the set `new_marks`. 

Given that `mark` is the third mark in the list `marks`, and `x` is an integer, the value added to `new_marks` will be an integer as well.

However, there is an issue in the given code. The set `new_marks` is not defined in the initial state. It is assumed that `new_marks` is already defined as a set before this line of code is executed. If not, this line would result in an error.

Assuming `new_marks` is defined, the impact of this code on the program is the addition of a new element to `new_marks`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, and `mark`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list, and `new_marks` is a set that includes the value `mark + x`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list, and `new_marks` contains the element `mark + x`.**
