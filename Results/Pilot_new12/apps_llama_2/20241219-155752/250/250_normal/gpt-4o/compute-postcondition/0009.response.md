Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list. If either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is present in `marks_set`, then the current value of `x_found` is True and the current value of `y_found` is False. Otherwise, the current value of `x_found` is False and the current value of `y_found` is False. `marks` contains at least one mark such that either `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.**
