According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 3 marks, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 2 marks, `mark` is the second mark in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 marks and the `mark` is the third mark in the list.
State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list**
