Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean values. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both True, then the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `new_marks` is not empty, one element has been removed from `new_marks`, the value 1 and one mark offset have been printed. If `new_marks` is empty, the state of `new_marks` and other variables remains unchanged, and if `y_found` is False, the string representation of `result` has been printed as 'x y', where `result` is a list containing two integers `x` and `y`. In all cases, if `y_found` is False, then `x_found` is False, and if `x_found` is False, then `x` is not present in `marks_set`.**
