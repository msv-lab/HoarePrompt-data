A new set named `new_marks` is created. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is True if any mark's `x` offset is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`, either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), `new_marks` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is True if any mark's `x` offset is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`, either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), `new_marks` is an empty set**
