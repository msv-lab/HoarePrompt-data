The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The current state of `x_found` is True and the current state of `y_found` is True, indicating that for at least one mark in `marks`, either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is present in `marks_set`. 
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `x_found` is True, `y_found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
