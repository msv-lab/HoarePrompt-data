Given the initial state and the code snippet `new_marks.add(mark - y)`, we analyze the impact on the program.

The code adds `mark - y` to the `new_marks` set. 

Since `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` if at least one of the conditions is true, or it remains an empty set unless `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, in which case it contains `mark - x`, the addition of `mark - y` updates `new_marks` regardless of its previous state.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, and `y_found`) are not directly affected by this operation.

The value of `x_found` is not specified in the initial state description, but its value does not influence the outcome of the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains `mark - y` in addition to any elements it might have had before the operation, and the conditions regarding `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, `mark - y + x`, and `mark - y - x` being in `marks_set` or not remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the addition to `new_marks`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains at least `mark - y`, and the conditions regarding `x_found`, `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, `mark - y + x`, and `mark - y - x` being in `marks_set` or not remain as previously defined**
