The value of `result` is assigned an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks` retain their initial values and properties.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean values indicating the initial presence of `x` and `y` offsets in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, and `result` is an empty list.**
