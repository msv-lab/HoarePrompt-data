Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution as `x_found` and `y_found` are not both `True`.**
