According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 1 mark, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` as integers, and `x_found` and `y_found` as False does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `marks` must have at least 1 mark and `mark` is the first mark in the list.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `mark` is the first mark in the list**
