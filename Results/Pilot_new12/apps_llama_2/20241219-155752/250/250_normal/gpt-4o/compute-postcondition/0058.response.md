Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in the list. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark + x`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set` and none of the above conditions are met, then `new_marks` contains `mark - x`. If none of the above conditions are met, the state of `new_marks` is not defined.***
