To calculate the output state, let's consider the impact of the code on the program. The code adds `mark - x` to the `new_marks` set.

The initial state indicates that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least one mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`, and `new_marks` is an empty set. The current `mark` is the first mark in the list, and neither `mark + x + y` nor `mark + x - y` are in `marks_set`, but at least one of `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.

Given this information, when `new_marks.add(mark - x)` is executed, `new_marks` will contain the value `mark - x`. Since `mark - x` is the result of subtracting `x` from `mark`, this value is now part of `new_marks`. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, considering the provided initial conditions and the executed code, the output state is updated as follows: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` remains False, `y_found` remains True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`, and `mark` is the first mark in the list, with the conditions regarding `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, and `mark - x - y` in relation to `marks_set` still applicable.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`, `mark` is the first mark in the list, neither `mark + x + y` nor `mark + x - y` are in `marks_set`, but at least one of `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.**
