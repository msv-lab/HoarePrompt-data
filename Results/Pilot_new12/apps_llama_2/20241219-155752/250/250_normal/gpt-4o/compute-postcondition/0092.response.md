Functionality: **This function determines the minimum number of marks that need to be added to a ruler to ensure that it has marks at distances x and y from any existing mark. It accepts input parameters n (number of marks), l (ruler length), x, and y (specific marks), as well as a sequence of marks a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}. The function returns 0 if both x and y offsets are already present in the marks, 1 followed by a single mark offset if only one of x or y offsets is not present, or the count of missing offsets (x and/or y) followed by the offsets themselves if neither x nor y offsets are present. If there are multiple possible mark offsets, it selects one of them. The function handles cases where the ruler already has x and/or y offsets, as well as cases where the ruler does not have these offsets, and returns the minimum number of marks that need to be added.**
