Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean values indicating the presence of `x` and `y` offsets in `marks_set`, if `x_found` is False, then `result` is a list containing the integer `x`, otherwise, `result` and `new_marks` remain unchanged, with `x` not present in `marks_set` when `x_found` is False.**
