The value of `x_found` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `mark` is the third mark in the list, `x_found` is `True`.
