Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. If `new_marks` is not empty, then one element has been removed from `new_marks`, the value 1 and one `mark` offset have been printed. If `new_marks` is empty, then the state of `new_marks` and other variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if `y_found` is False, then `x_found` is False, and if `x_found` is False, then `x` is not present in `marks_set`. The length of `result` is 2 and the string representation of `result` has been printed as 'x y', but only when `new_marks` is empty. In all cases, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean values indicating the presence of `x` and `y` offsets in `marks_set`, and `result` is a list containing two integers `x` and `y` when `y_found` is False.**
