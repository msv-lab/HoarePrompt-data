Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list `marks`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark - x`.**
