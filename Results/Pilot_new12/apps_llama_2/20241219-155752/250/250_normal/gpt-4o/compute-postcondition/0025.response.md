Given the code `y_found = True`, we can determine the output state by analyzing the impact of this assignment on the program.

The code sets the value of `y_found` to `True`. This directly changes the state of the variable `y_found` from its previous state (which was not specified) to `True`. All other variables and conditions given in the initial state remain unaffected by this assignment.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the change made by the code:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list.
- `mark` is the third mark in the list.
- If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`.
- `y_found` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set` then `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`**
