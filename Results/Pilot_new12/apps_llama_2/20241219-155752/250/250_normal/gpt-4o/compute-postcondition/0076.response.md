Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean values indicating the initial presence of `x` and `y` offsets in `marks_set`, and `new_marks` is a set containing all unique `mark` offsets (`+x`, `-x`, `+y`, `-y`) that met the specified conditions during the loop iterations. The current value of `new_marks` is not empty, meaning it contains at least one unique mark offset.**
