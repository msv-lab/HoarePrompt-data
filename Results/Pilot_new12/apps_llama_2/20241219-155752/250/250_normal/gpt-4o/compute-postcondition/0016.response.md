The code sets `x_found` to `True`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, and `y_found` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `mark` is the second mark in the list, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` remains unchanged**
