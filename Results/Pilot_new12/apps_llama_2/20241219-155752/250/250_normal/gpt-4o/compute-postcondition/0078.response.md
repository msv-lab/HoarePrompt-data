The code `print(new_marks.pop())` removes and returns an arbitrary element from the `new_marks` set, and the value 1 has been printed, and then this element is printed. 

The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, and `y_found` are not affected. The `new_marks` set is modified by removing one element. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` and `y_found` are boolean values, `new_marks` is a set containing all unique `mark` offsets but one element has been removed, the value 1 and one `mark` offset have been printed.
