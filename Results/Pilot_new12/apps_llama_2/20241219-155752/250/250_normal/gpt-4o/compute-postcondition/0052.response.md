Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list. If `y_found` is False, then if `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, and `mark + y` based on previous conditions. If none of these conditions are met, but `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least `mark - y`. If none of the above conditions are met, `new_marks` is updated according to the previous conditions regarding `x_found` and the presence of `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y` in `marks_set`, containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x` if at least one of the conditions is true, otherwise it remains an empty set unless `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, in which case it contains `mark - x`. In all cases, if `y_found` is initially False, it remains False after execution. If `y_found` is True, the state of `new_marks` and other variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
