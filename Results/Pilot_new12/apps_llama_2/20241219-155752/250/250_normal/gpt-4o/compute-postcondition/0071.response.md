The state of `new_marks` is updated by adding the element `mark - y`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the element `mark + x`. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is not in `marks_set` but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark - x`. The `new_marks` set now also contains `mark - y`. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list, `new_marks` contains the elements it had before and also `mark - y`. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the element `mark + x`. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is not in `marks_set` but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark - x` and also `mark - y`.**
