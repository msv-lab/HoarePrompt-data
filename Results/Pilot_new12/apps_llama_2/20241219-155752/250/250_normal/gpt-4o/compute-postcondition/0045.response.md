Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list. The current value of `y_found` is False, meaning none of the marks' `y` offset is in `marks_set`. If `x_found` is False, then the current value of `new_marks` is a set that may contain either `mark + x` or `mark - x` based on previous conditions. The current state of the program variables is such that at least one of the following conditions is true: `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`.**
