Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list. If either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is present in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is True and `y_found` is True. If neither `mark + y` nor `mark - y` is present in `marks_set`, then `x_found` remains False and `y_found` remains False, since there is no else part handling any changes.***
