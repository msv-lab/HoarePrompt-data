The code `break` does not change the values of the variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `mark`, `x_found`, and `y_found` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `mark` is the second mark in the list, if `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True` and if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
