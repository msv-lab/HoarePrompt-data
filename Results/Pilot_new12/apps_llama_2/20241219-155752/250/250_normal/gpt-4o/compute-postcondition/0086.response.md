Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. If `y_found` is False, then `x_found` is False, and `result` is a list containing the integers `x` and `y`, i.e., `[x, y]`. If `y_found` is True, then the state of `result` and other variables remains unchanged from the precondition, with `x` not present in `marks_set` when `x_found` is False.***
