To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given Python code on the program. The code is `new_marks.add(mark + y)`. 

Given the initial state, we have:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 2 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `mark` is the second mark in the list.
- The conditions for `new_marks` are based on whether certain expressions involving `mark`, `x`, and `y` are in `marks_set`.

The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` adds the value `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`, regardless of the conditions specified in the initial state for populating `new_marks`. This means that `new_marks` will definitely contain `mark + y` after the execution of this line.

Other variables and conditions are not directly affected by this line of code. The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, and the conditions for `new_marks` based on the expressions involving `mark`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, except that `new_marks` now definitely includes `mark + y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in the list, `new_marks` contains at least `mark + y`.**
