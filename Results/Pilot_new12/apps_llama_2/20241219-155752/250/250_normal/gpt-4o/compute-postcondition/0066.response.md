To solve this, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `mark` is the third mark in the list `marks`.
- A new set `new_marks` is being used.

The line of code provided is:
```python
new_marks.add(mark - x)
```

This code adds a new element to the `new_marks` set, which is the difference between `mark` (the third mark in the `marks` list) and `x` (an integer).

The impact of the code on the program is:
- The set `new_marks` is updated by adding a new element `mark - x`.
- The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `marks_set`, and `mark`) remain unchanged.

Given that `mark` is the third mark in `marks` and is an integer, and `x` is also an integer, `mark - x` will be an integer.

Since `new_marks` is not defined in the initial state, we can infer it starts as an empty set before this operation. After the operation, it will contain at least one element, which is `mark - x`.

The output state, therefore, includes:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `mark` is the third mark in the list `marks`, which is an integer.
- `new_marks` is a set containing at least one integer, `mark - x`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list `marks`, and `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark - x`.**
