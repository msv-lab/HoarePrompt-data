Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, the current value of `x_found` is False, meaning no mark's `x` offset is in `marks_set`. The current value of `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`. `new_marks` is an empty set, `mark` is the first mark in the list. Neither `mark + x + y`, nor `mark + x - y` are in `marks_set`. However, at least one of the following conditions is met: either `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.**
