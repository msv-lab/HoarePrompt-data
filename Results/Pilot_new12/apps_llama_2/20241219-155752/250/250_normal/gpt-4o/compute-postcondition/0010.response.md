The given code sets `y_found` to `True`. This means that the condition for `y_found` to be `True` is met. The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list. If either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is present in `marks_set`, then the current value of `x_found` is True and the current value of `y_found` is True. Otherwise, the current value of `x_found` is False and the current value of `y_found` is True. `y_found` is True and `marks` contains at least one mark such that either `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.**
