To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides that:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `mark` is the third mark in the list.
- The conditions for `new_marks` are based on the presence of specific expressions in `marks_set`.

The code `new_marks.add(mark + y)` modifies the `new_marks` set by adding the element `mark + y` to it.

Given the initial conditions for `new_marks` and the action of adding `mark + y` to it, we need to consider how this addition affects the state of `new_marks` relative to the conditions provided.

The addition of `mark + y` to `new_marks` does not depend on the conditions that were previously set for `new_marks` (i.e., whether `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y` are in `marks_set`). This means that `new_marks` will now definitely contain the element `mark + y`, regardless of the previous conditions.

Therefore, the output state, considering all provided information and the modification made by the code, is:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `mark` is the third mark in the list.
- `new_marks` contains at least the element `mark + y`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list, and `new_marks` contains at least the element `mark + y`.**
