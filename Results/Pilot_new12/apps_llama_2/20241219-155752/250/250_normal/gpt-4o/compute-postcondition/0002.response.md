The code creates a new set called `marks_set` from the list `marks`. This set will contain unique integers from the `marks` list, as sets in Python cannot have duplicate values.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list**
