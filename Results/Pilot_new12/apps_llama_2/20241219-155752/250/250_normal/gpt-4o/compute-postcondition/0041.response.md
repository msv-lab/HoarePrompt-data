Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, if at least one of `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`, and `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`. If neither `mark - x + y` nor `mark - x - y` are in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` remains an empty set. In all cases, `mark` is the first mark in the list, and neither `mark + x + y` nor `mark + x - y` are in `marks_set`.***
