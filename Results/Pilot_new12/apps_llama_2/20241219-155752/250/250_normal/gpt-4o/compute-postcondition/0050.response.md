Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains at least `mark - y`, and the conditions regarding `x_found`, `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, `mark - y + x`, and `mark - y - x` being in `marks_set` or not remain as previously defined. If none of these conditions are met, `y_found` remains False, and `new_marks` is updated according to the previous conditions regarding `x_found` and the presence of `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, `mark - x + y`, or `mark - x - y` in `marks_set`.***
