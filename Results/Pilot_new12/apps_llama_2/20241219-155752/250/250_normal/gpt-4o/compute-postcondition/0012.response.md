Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list. For each mark in `marks`, if either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is present in `marks_set`, then the current value of `x_found` is True and the current value of `y_found` is True. The current state of `x_found` is True and the current state of `y_found` is True, indicating that for at least one mark in `marks`, either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is present in `marks_set`.**
