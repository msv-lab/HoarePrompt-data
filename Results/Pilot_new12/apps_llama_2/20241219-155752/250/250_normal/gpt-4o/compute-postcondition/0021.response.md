Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list, `mark` is the second mark in the list. If `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
