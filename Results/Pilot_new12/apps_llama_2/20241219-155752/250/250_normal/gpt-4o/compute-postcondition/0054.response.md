To determine the output state, we need to examine the given code snippet and its effect on the variables provided in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers.
- `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks.
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`.
- `mark` is the second mark in the list.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
new_marks.add(mark + x)
```

However, there's an issue here: `new_marks` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming that `new_marks` is a set that has been initialized before this line of code (as it's being used with the `add` method, which is applicable to sets), we can proceed.

The impact of this line of code is to add a new element to the `new_marks` set. This element is the sum of `mark` (the second mark in the `marks` list) and `x`.

The variables `n`, `l`, `y`, `marks`, and `marks_set` are not directly affected by this operation. The variable `mark` is used but not changed; it remains the second mark in the `marks` list.

Given that `new_marks` was not part of the initial state, we must include it in the output state, specifying that it now contains at least the element `mark + x`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the provided code and initial conditions, is:

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in the list, and `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark + x`.**
