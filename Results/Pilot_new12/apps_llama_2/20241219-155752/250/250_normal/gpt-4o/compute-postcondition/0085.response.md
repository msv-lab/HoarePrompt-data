The given code `result.append(y)` modifies the `result` list by appending the value of `y` to it. Since `x_found` is False, the initial `result` is a list containing the integer `x`, i.e., `[x]`. After appending `y`, the new `result` becomes `[x, y]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, `result` is a list containing the integers `x` and `y`, i.e., `[x, y]`.**
