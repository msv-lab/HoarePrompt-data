The given Python code is appending the value of `x` to the `result` list. 

`x` is an integer and `x` is not present in `marks_set`, and `x_found` is False indicating the initial absence of `x` offset in `marks_set`. 

The value of `result` is initially an empty list, and after appending `x` to `result`, the `result` list now contains the integer `x`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is a boolean value indicating the presence of `y` offset in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, and `result` is a list containing the integer `x`, and `x` is not present in `marks_set`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` is a boolean value indicating the presence of `y` offset in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing the integer `x`, and `x` is not present in `marks_set`.**
