Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `x_found` or `y_found`.**
