Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the `marks` list. If either `mark + x` or `mark - x` is present in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is True and `y_found` is False. Otherwise, the state of `x_found` and `y_found` remains unchanged, but since there is no else part handling any changes, `x_found` remains False and `y_found` remains False.***
