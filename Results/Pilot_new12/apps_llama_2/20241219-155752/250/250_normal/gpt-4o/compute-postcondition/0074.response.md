Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 3 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in the list. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least the element `mark + x`. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is not in `marks_set` but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element, `mark - x`. If neither of the above conditions are met, the state of `new_marks` is not modified. Additionally, when `y_found` is False, `new_marks` may also contain `mark + y` if `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y` if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set` and `mark - x` is in `new_marks`.***
