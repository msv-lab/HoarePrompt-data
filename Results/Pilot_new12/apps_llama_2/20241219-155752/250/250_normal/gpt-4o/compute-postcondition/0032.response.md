Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is True if any mark's `x` offset is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`. Either `x_found` is False or `y_found` is False (or both), meaning that not all of the following conditions are met: any mark's `x` offset is in `marks_set` and any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`.**
