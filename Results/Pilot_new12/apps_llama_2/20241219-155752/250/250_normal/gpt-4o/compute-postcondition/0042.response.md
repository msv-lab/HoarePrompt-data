Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the first mark in the list. If at least one of the following conditions is true: `mark + x + y` is in `marks_set`, `mark + x - y` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing either `mark + x` or `mark - x`. `x_found` remains False, and `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`. If none of the above conditions are met, `new_marks` remains an empty set unless `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, in which case it contains `mark - x`, and `y_found` is True if any mark's `y` offset is in `marks_set`.**
