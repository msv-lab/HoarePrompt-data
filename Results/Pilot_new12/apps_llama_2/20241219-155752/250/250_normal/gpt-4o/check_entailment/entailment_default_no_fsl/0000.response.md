Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be doing what the problem description says. It checks if the ruler already has marks at distances x and y from any existing mark, and if not, it determines the minimum number of additional marks that need to be added to the ruler.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. The code first checks if both x and y distances are already present in the marks. If they are, it prints 0, which is correct.

2. If only one of x or y distances is not present, it checks for possible combinations of existing marks that can be used to create the missing distance. If it finds such a combination, it adds the missing distance as a new mark and prints 1.

3. If neither x nor y distances are present in the marks, it adds both x and y as new marks and prints the number of new marks, which is 2 in this case.

The code seems to handle all the possible cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided also seem to be working correctly. Therefore, it appears that the program does what the problem description says for every potential case.

The output hints also seem to agree with the code and provide examples of cases where the code works correctly. Additionally, the problem description provides examples that the code handles correctly.

Overall, based on the provided information, it seems that the code is correct.
