Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The issue lies in the way it checks for the possibility of measuring distances x and y with the given marks on the ruler.

The program correctly checks if the given marks can be used to measure the distances x and y. However, when it tries to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure these distances, it uses a flawed approach.

The program tries to find a single mark that can be added to the ruler to measure both x and y. It checks for conditions such as `mark + x + y in marks_set` or `mark - x + y in marks_set`. However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee that the minimum number of additional marks is found.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of marks that can be added to the ruler to measure x and y. This could involve checking all possible pairs of marks that can be added to measure x and y, or using a more sophisticated algorithm to find the minimum number of additional marks needed.

For example, consider the case where the input is `n = 2, l = 300, x = 185, y = 230`, and the marks are `0` and `300`. The program will incorrectly output `2` and the marks `185` and `230`, when in fact it is possible to add a single mark at `115` to measure both `x` and `y` (since `300 - 115 = 185` and `115 + 115 = 230`).

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
