Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It checks if the distances x and y can be measured using the existing marks on the ruler. If both x and y can be measured, it prints 0. If not, it tries to find a single additional mark that can be added to the ruler to measure both x and y. If such a mark is found, it prints 1 and the position of the mark. If no such mark is found, it prints the number of additional marks needed (either 1 or 2) and their positions.

The program handles all possible cases:

1. Both x and y can be measured using the existing marks.
2. Only one of x or y can be measured using the existing marks, and an additional mark is needed to measure the other.
3. Neither x nor y can be measured using the existing marks, and two additional marks are needed.

The program uses a set to store the existing marks on the ruler, which allows for efficient checking of whether a mark exists or not. It also uses a set to store the new marks that need to be added, which ensures that duplicate marks are not added.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
