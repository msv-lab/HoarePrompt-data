The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 <... < a_{n} = l), representing the distances of the marks from the origin on the ruler, where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function analyzes a set of marks on a ruler and determines the minimum number of additional marks required to ensure that all possible differences between marks, specifically x and y, can be measured. It takes as input a line with four integers (n, l, x, y) representing the number of marks, the length of the ruler, and the two target differences, and a second line with n integers representing the initial marks. The function calculates the additional marks needed to satisfy the target differences and prints the count and values of these additional marks. It handles cases where the target differences are not present in the initial marks and generates new marks that are sums of existing marks and previous additional marks, up to the length of the ruler. The function does not modify the original marks but generates a new set of additional marks based on the requirement to measure the target differences.
