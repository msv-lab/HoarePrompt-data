Precondition: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains four positive integers n, l, x, and y, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 <... < a_{n} = l), representing the distances of the marks from the origin on the ruler, where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.**
