The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. Since `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not an element in `marks`, this operation is valid according to the preconditions.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element from `marks`, `additional_marks` is not empty and contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`. 

After executing `additional_marks.append(i + j)`, `additional_marks` now includes the sum `i + j` in addition to its previous elements. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element from `marks`, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes `i + j`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks` which is now the second element because `i + j` has been added and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and is not an element in `marks`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.**
