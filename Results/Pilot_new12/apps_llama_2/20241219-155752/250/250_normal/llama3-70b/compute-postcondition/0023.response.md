To determine the state at the start of the for loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5
- `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`
- `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`
- `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `n-1`
- `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[0]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` is `False`
- `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[0]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_y` is `False`

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Since we are given that `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, the condition for the loop to execute is already met.

However, considering the loop variable `j`, at the start of the loop, `j` should be equal to `i`, which is 1. The given state has `j` as `n-1`, which is the last index of the `marks` set. This needs to be adjusted to match the initial value of the loop variable.

The state of `need_x` and `need_y` depends on the existence of certain differences between elements in the `marks` set, but these do not affect the execution of the loop itself. They are conditions based on the content of `marks`, not on the loop's range or indices.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `j` should be adjusted to be equal to `i`, which is 1, at the start of the loop.
- The conditions on `x`, `y`, `l`, `n`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` are already given and do not directly impact whether the loop executes, given that `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[0]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[0]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_y` is `False**
