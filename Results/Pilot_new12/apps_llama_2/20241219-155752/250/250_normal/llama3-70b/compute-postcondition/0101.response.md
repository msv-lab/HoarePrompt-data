The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the set `additional_marks`. 

Given that `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`, we cannot directly determine the value of `i` from the given information, but we know that `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The value of `i` is not provided, so `i + j` can be any integer that is less than or equal to `l` and is not already in `marks`, and also meets the criteria of being a sum of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks`. However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it's an integer such that `i + j` satisfies these conditions.

The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y` are not affected by this operation.

The output state will be: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least four elements including the sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, `j` is an element in `additional_marks`, and `i + j` is the newest element in `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least four elements including the sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, `j` is an element in `additional_marks`, and `i + j` is the newest element in `additional_marks`.**
