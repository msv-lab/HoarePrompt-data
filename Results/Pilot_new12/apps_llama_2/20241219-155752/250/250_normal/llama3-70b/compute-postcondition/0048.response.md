Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > `i`, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is `i`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True` and `need_x` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`, otherwise `need_y` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]` and `need_x` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`.**
