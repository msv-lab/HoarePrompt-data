To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code is appending a new element to the `additional_marks` list. This new element is the sum of `i` and `j`, where `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`. 

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine its value. However, we know that `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`. 

The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` are not affected by the code. 

`additional_marks` now includes all its previous elements and at least one more element, which is `i + j`. 

The value of `j` is still the third element in `additional_marks` before the append operation. After the append operation, `j` will no longer be the third element in `additional_marks` because a new element has been added to the end of the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes at least one more element which is `i + j`, `j` was the third element in `additional_marks` before the append operation**
