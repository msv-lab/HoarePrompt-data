According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `j` is still within the loop range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > 4, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers**
