You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains four positive integers n, l, x, and y, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 <... < a_{n} = l), representing the distances of the marks from the origin on the ruler, where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, otherwise `need_x` is `False`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `y`, otherwise `need_y` is `False`.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`. If there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, then `need_x` is `True`. If `need_y` is `False`, then if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, `additional_marks` contains `y`, otherwise `additional_marks` contains `x` and `y`. If `need_y` is `True`, then the state of `need_x`, `additional_marks`, and other variables remains as per the precondition.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two lines of input - the first line containing four positive integers and the second line containing a sequence of distances of marks on a ruler, and it returns a result based on the analysis of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
