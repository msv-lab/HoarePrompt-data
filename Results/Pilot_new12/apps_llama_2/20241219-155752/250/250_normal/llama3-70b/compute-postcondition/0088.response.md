According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least 3 elements and `j` must be the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes at least one more element, `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`**
