Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`; otherwise, the state of `need_y` remains unchanged, which was `True` if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y` before the if statement execution, and the state of `need_x` remains unchanged.**
