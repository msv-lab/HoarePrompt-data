To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in additional_marks:`. This means the loop will execute for each element in `additional_marks`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element after the second element, which means it must have at least three elements.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the third element in `additional_marks`.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`) do not directly depend on the loop variable `j` and their values do not change solely based on the loop iteration. Therefore, their states remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration, with the understanding that any changes made to them within the loop body (not shown) would be reflected in their new states.

However, considering the problem statement's emphasis on understanding the state at the start of the loop iteration and given that no explicit changes to these variables are mentioned within the loop body, we focus on the loop control variable `j` and the collection it iterates over, `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least three elements including the sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`.**
