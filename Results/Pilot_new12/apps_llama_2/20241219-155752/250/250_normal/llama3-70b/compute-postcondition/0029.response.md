Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True` and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` is not necessarily `True`, and `need_y` is `True` if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, otherwise the state of `need_y` and `need_x` remains as it was before the if statement execution, since there is no else part to modify their state.**
