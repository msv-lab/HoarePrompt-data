The code `additional_marks.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the `additional_marks` list. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5
- `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`
- `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`
- `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `n-1`
- `need_x` is `False` because there does not exist a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`
- `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `y`
- `additional_marks` is an empty list

After executing the code, `additional_marks` is no longer empty, it now contains the value `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `y`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing the value `x`.**
