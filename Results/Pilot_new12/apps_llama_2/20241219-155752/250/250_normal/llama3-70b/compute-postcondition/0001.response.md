The code reads a sequence of integers from the input, converts them to a set of integers, and assigns it to the variable `marks`. 

The set `marks` is assigned the value of a set of `n` integers read from the input, where each integer is converted from a string using the `map` function and `int` function. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, and `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, and `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers read from the input**
