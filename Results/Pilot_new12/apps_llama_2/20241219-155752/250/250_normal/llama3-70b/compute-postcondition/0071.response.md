The value of `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`. The value of `i` is an element from `marks`, and the value of `j` is an element from `additional_marks`. The sum of `i` and `j` is not an element of `marks` and is less than or equal to `l`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, except for `additional_marks`, which now includes the value `i + j`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is an element from `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` is not empty, has at least one element, and includes `i + j`, and `i + j` is not an element of `marks` and is less than or equal to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is an element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty, has at least one element, includes `i + j`, and `i + j` is not an element of `marks` and is less than or equal to `l`.**
