Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, then `need_x` is `True` and `additional_marks` is an empty list, otherwise `need_x` is `False` and `additional_marks` contains the value `x`, `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `y`.**
