The value of `need_x` is updated to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `False`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `marks[j]` minus the current value of `marks[i]` equals `x`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `False`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `marks[j]` minus the current value of `marks[i]` equals `x`**
