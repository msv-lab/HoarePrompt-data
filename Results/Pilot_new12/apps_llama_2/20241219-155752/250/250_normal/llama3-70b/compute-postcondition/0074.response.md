The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
- `i` is an element from `marks`.
- `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`.
- `additional_marks` is not empty and has at least two elements.
- The value of `i + j` is calculated and appended to `additional_marks`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 
`l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, 
`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, 
`y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, 
`marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, 
`i` is an element from `marks`, 
`j` is the next element from `additional_marks`, 
`need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, 
`additional_marks` is not empty, has at least three elements, and its last element is `i + j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty, has at least three elements, and its last element is `i + j`.**
