According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[2]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[2]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_y` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`.**
