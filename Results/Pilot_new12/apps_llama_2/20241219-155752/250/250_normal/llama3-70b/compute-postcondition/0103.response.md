To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is appending new elements to `additional_marks` if the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. The output states after the loop executes a few times indicate that `additional_marks` is being populated with all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.

Given the initial state and the loop code, we can infer the following:

- `n` and `l` are unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `x` and `y` are also unchanged as their values do not depend on the loop iterations.
- `marks` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it; it only checks for membership.
- `additional_marks` is populated with all possible sums that meet the conditions (`i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`).
- `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, implying their values do not change based on the loop's execution.
- The variable `j` represents the current element being processed from `additional_marks`, and its value changes with each iteration.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `additional_marks` will contain all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. This is because the loop continues to append new sums to `additional_marks` as long as the conditions are met, effectively generating all possible combinations that fit the criteria until no more new combinations can be added.

Therefore, considering the initial conditions and the loop's behavior, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.**
