Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > `i`, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is `i`, the current value of `j` is such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers. The current value of `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `x`, and the current value of `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[2]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_x` and `need_y` remain as initially set based on `marks[1]`.**
