The given code line `n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads the input values from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. Since the input consists of four positive integers, we know that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` will be assigned integer values.

Given the constraints:
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`
- `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`

The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are now integers within these specified ranges. The sequence of `n` integers representing the distances of the marks from the origin on the ruler has not been read yet, so we cannot determine its values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, and the sequence of `n` integers has not been read yet.**
