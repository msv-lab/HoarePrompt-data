Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is an element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty and has at least one element, and `additional_marks` is as per its preconditioned value based on `need_y`, `x`, `y`, and `marks`. The current value of `i` plus the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `l`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is not an element of `marks`.**
