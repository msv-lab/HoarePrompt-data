Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, and also contains `i + j`, otherwise `additional_marks` remains unchanged, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`***
