Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`. If there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, then `need_x` is `True`. If `need_y` is `False`, then if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, `additional_marks` contains `y`, otherwise `additional_marks` contains `x` and `y`. If `need_y` is `True`, then the state of `need_x`, `additional_marks`, and other variables remains as per the precondition.***
