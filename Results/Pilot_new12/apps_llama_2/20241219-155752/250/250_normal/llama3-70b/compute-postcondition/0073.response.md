According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If the set has at least one more element, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` is not empty and has at least one element, `j` is an element from `additional_marks`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least two elements and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is the next element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty and has at least two elements**
