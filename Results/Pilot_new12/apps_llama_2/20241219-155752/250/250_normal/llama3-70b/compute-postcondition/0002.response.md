The code snippet initializes two new variables, `need_x` and `need_y`, to `False`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, or `marks`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `need_x` is False, and `need_y` is False**
