Since `need_y` is set to `True`, this means that there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[0]` equals `y`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, and the current value of `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, it is still the case that there exists at least one pair of elements in `marks` where the difference is `y`. Also, `need_x` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` is not necessarily `True`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `need_y` is `True`, and if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True` and the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, otherwise `need_x` is not necessarily `True`**
