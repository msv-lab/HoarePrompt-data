Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`, then `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes `i + j`, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`. Otherwise, the state remains the same with `marks` and `additional_marks` unchanged, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.***
