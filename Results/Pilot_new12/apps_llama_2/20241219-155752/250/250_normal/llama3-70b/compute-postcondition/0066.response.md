The code appends `y` to `additional_marks`. Initially, `additional_marks` contains the value `x` if there is no pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, otherwise it is empty. After executing the code, `additional_marks` will contain the value `x` (if `need_x` is `False`) and `y`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, `need_y`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, if there exists a pair of elements in `marks` whose difference is `x`, then `need_x` is `True` and `additional_marks` is a list containing `y`, otherwise `need_x` is `False` and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`, `need_y` is `False`**
