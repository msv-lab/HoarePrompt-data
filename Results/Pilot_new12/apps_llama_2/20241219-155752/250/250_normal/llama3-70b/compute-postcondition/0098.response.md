To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we first need to understand what the code does and how it affects the existing variables.

The given code snippet is:
```python
additional_marks.append(i + j)
```
This line of code adds a new element to the `additional_marks` set, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5,
- `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9,
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`,
- `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`,
- `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers,
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`,
- `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`,
- `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`.

However, there seems to be a missing piece of information: the value or definition of `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, we will assume that `i` is an integer that has been defined elsewhere in the code with a value that is relevant to the context of the `additional_marks` set.

The execution of the code adds `i + j` to `additional_marks`. The set `additional_marks` now contains all its previous elements plus the new sum `i + j`, if this sum is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. 

Given that the initial state of `additional_marks` includes all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, adding `i + j` to `additional_marks` means that this new sum also meets these criteria, implicitly assuming `i + j` is within the specified bounds and not in `marks`.

The output state, considering the update to `additional_marks`, is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5,
- `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9,
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`,
- `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`,
- `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers,
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, now including `i + j`, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`,
- `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`,
- `j` remains the second element in the original `additional_marks`, but note that the structure of `additional_marks` has changed with the addition of `i + j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least two elements including `i + j`, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `j` is the second element in the original `additional_marks`.**
