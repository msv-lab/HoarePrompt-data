Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes at least one more element which is `i + j`, and `j` was the third element in `additional_marks` before the append operation; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged***
