The code `need_y = True` directly assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. This means that regardless of the previous conditions or values, `need_y` is now set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `need_x` remains unchanged, `need_y` is `True`, and `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
