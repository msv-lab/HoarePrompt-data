The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` set. 

Given that `i` + `j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i` + `j` is not an element in `marks`, the size of `additional_marks` increases by 1. 

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 
`l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, 
`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, 
`y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, 
`marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, 
`additional_marks` is not empty, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, and also contains `i` + `j`, 
`need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, 
and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, and also contains `i` + `j`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`.**
