According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged, if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`, otherwise `need_y` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
