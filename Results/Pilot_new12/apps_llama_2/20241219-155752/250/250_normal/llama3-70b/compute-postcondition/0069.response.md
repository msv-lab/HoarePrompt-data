According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the given state does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect that `additional_marks` must have at least one element and `j` will be an element from `additional_marks` during the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` will be an element from `marks` during the loop, `j` is an element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty and has at least one element, and `additional_marks` is as per its preconditioned value based on `need_y`, `x`, `y`, and `marks`**
