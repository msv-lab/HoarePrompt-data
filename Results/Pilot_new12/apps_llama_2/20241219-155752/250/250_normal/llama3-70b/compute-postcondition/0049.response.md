According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is `i` (so `j` is 2), `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > 3, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True` and `need_x` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`, otherwise `need_y` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]` and `need_x` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`.**
