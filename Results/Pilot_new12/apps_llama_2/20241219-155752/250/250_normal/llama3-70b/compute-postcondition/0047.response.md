The value of `need_y` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > `i`, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is `i`, the current value of `j` is such that `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `need_x` remains as initially set based on `marks[1]`, and `need_y` is `True`.
