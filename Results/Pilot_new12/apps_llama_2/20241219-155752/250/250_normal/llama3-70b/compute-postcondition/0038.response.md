The value of `need_y` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > 3, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `need_y` is `True**
