Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > 3, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers. If `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`. Otherwise, `need_x` and `need_y` remain as initially set based on `marks[1]`.***
