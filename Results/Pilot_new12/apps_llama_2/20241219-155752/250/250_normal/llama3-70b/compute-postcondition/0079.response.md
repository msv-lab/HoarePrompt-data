Based on the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can analyze the final output state of the loop.

The loop iterates over the `additional_marks` list and checks if the sum of the current element `i` from `marks` and the current element `j` from `additional_marks` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. If the condition is met, the sum `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe that:

* `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
* `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
* `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
* `marks` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
* `i` is an element from `marks`, and its value may change during the loop execution.
* `j` is an element from `additional_marks`, and its value may change during the loop execution.
* `need_x` and `need_y` are based on the original values of `marks` and `x`, and their values do not change during the loop execution.
* `additional_marks` is modified within the loop by appending new elements if the condition is met.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state can be determined as follows:

* `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.
* `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9.
* `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`.
* `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`.
* `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers.
* `i` is an element from `marks`.
* `j` is the last element from `additional_marks`.
* `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.
* `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is the last element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.**
