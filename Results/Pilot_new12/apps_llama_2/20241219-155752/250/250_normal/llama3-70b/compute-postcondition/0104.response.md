To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is designed to generate all possible sums of elements from `marks` and `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. The loop iterates over each element `i` in `marks` and each element `j` in `additional_marks`, checking if their sum is within the limit `l` and not a duplicate in `marks`. If these conditions are met, the sum `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer the following:

- `n` and `l` are constrained by their initial definitions but do not change during the loop execution.
- `x` and `y` are integers with specific constraints and are related to the initial condition of `marks` and the state of `need_x` and `need_y`. Their values do not change during the loop.
- `marks` initially contains `n` unique integers, and its size may conceptually decrease as elements are processed, but in reality, it remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `marks`.
- `additional_marks` starts with either `x` and `y` or just `y`, based on the initial state of `need_x` and `need_y`. During the loop, it accumulates all possible sums of elements from `marks` and itself that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.
- `i` and `j` are iteration variables, with `i` taking on values from `marks` and `j` taking on values from `additional_marks`. After the loop, `i` would be the last element from `marks`, and `j` would be the last element processed from `additional_marks`.
- `need_x` and `need_y` are boolean indicators based on the presence of differences `x` and `y` in the original `marks`. Their states are determined before the loop and do not change during the loop.

Considering the loop's operation, after all iterations have finished:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values since they are not modified by the loop.
- `marks` remains a set of `n` unique integers, as the loop does not alter it.
- `additional_marks` will contain all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, accumulated from the initial `x` and/or `y` based on `need_x` and `need_y`.
- `i` will be the last element from `marks` after the loop iterates over all elements.
- `j` will be the last element appended to `additional_marks` during the loop.
- `need_x` and `need_y` retain their initial boolean values, determined by the original state of `marks` and the differences `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.**
