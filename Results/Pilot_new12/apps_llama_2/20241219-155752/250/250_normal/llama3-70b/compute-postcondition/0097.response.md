According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If the set is not empty after the last iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is not empty and contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least two elements, and `j` must be the second element in `additional_marks`. Since `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, its size may increase or remain unchanged after the last iteration.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of at least one less than the previous size of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`**
