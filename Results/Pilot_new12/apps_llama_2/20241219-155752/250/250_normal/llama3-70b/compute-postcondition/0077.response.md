The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds a new element to the `additional_marks` list, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is the second last element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty, has at least three elements, and the last element is `i + j`**
