According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least three elements and its last element is `i + j`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least two elements (because one element has been processed in the last iteration) and its last element must be the second last element of the previous `additional_marks`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `i` is an element from `marks`, `j` is the second last element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on `marks` and `x`, `additional_marks` is not empty and has at least two elements**
