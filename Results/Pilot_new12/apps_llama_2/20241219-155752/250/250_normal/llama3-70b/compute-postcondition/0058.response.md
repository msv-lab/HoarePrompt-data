Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > 4, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is True. Otherwise, the state of `need_y` is unchanged.***
