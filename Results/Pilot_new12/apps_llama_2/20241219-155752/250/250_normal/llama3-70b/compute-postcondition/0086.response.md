The given code appends `i + j` to `additional_marks`. This means that `additional_marks` now includes all its previous elements and the new element `i + j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^5. 
`l` is still an integer between 2 and 10^9. 
`x` is still an integer between 1 and `y` and less than or equal to `l`. 
`y` is still an integer greater than `x` and less than or equal to `l`. 
`i` is still the next element from `marks`.
`marks` is still a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
`additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes `i + j`.
`j` is still the second element in `additional_marks`.
`need_x` and `need_y` are still as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `i` is the next element from `marks`, if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`, then `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `additional_marks` is not empty, contains all previous elements, and now includes `i + j`, `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`, otherwise, the state remains the same with `marks` and `additional_marks` unchanged, and `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x**.
