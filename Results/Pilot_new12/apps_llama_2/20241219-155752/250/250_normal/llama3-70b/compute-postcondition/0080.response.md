To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the loop iterates over the elements of `marks`. Since `i` is an element from `marks` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `marks` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet.

Given that `i` is an element from `marks`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `marks` that hasn't been processed yet. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `need_x`, `need_y`, `marks`, `j`, and `additional_marks`) do not change based on the loop iteration itself; their changes depend on the operations within the loop body, which are not specified here.

However, since we're considering the loop's ability to execute again based solely on the loop statement, we only need to focus on the condition that allows the loop to continue, which is that there are more elements in `marks` to iterate over.

Therefore, the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` must be updated to the next unprocessed element in `marks`.
- The fact that `marks` has at least one more element to process implies that the loop can continue.

Other variables' states do not directly influence the loop's continuation based on the loop statement provided, so we don't need to adjust their states for the purpose of this analysis.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element from `marks`, `j` is the last element from `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`.**
