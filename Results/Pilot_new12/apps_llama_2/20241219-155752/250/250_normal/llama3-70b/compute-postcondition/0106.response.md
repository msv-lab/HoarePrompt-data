The provided Python code snippet is a print statement that prints the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces. This operation does not modify any variables but outputs the contents of `additional_marks` to the console. The state of all variables remains unchanged, but the value of `additional_marks` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, the value of `additional_marks` has been printed, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`, and the length of `additional_marks` has been returned.**
