Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a non-empty set of `n` unique integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element from `marks`, `additional_marks` is not empty and contains all possible sums of elements from `marks` and previous elements in `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `need_x` and `need_y` are as per their preconditioned values based on the original `marks` and `x`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not an element in `marks`.**
