The code sets `need_y` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not changed. 
The value of `n` is still an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 
the value of `l` is still an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, 
the value of `x` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, 
the value of `y` is still an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, 
the value of `marks` is still a set of `n` unique integers, 
`i` is still 1, 
`j` is still 2. 
The state of `need_x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `need_y` is `True**
