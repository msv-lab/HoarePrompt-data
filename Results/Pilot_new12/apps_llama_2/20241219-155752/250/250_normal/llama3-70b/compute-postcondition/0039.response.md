Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5 and `n` > 3, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` and `x` ≤ `l`, `y` is an integer such that `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `marks` is a set of `n` unique integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`; otherwise, the state of `need_y` remains unchanged, and if `marks[j]` - `marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True` or remains unchanged if this condition is not met.***
