Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle all possible cases. For example, it does not consider the case where the distance between two existing marks is equal to the difference between `y` and `x`. In such cases, adding only one mark at position `x` or `y` would allow both distances to be measured.

Moreover, the program's approach to add marks at positions where the sum of an existing mark and a new mark is within the length of the ruler and not already marked is inefficient and may lead to incorrect results. 

A correct solution would involve checking all possible pairs of existing marks to see if their differences cover both `x` and `y`, and if not, determining the minimum number of additional marks needed to cover both distances.

One possible counterexample to the given program is the input:
```
4 100 30 70
0 30 60 100
```
The program may incorrectly add a mark at position 70, even though adding a mark at position 40 would allow both distances to be measured (40-10 = 30, 100-30 = 70).
