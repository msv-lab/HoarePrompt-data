Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if we have the following input:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```
The program correctly outputs:
```
0
```
However, if we have the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```
The program correctly outputs:
```
1
230
```
But if we have the following input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
The program correctly outputs:
```
2
185 230
```
But if we have the following input:
```
2 300 120 180
0 300
```
The program will output:
```
2
120 180
```
However, it's possible to add only one mark, at position 120, because then you can measure 120 (0 to 120), and 180 (120 to 300). 

So the program does not find the minimum number of marks needed in all cases. 

This is because the program simply checks if the distances x and y can be measured with the current marks, and if not, it adds the distances x and y as new marks. But it does not consider the possibility that adding one mark might be enough to measure both distances.

A correct program should try to find the minimum number of marks needed to measure both distances x and y. It should check all possible combinations of marks and find the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

The current program does not do this, so it is incorrect. 

To fix this, we need to change the program to check all possible combinations of marks and find the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

Here is an example of how we can modify the program:
```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in marks:
        for j in marks:
            if j - i == x:
                need_x = True
            if j - i == y:
                need_y = True
    if need_x and need_y:
        print(0)
        return
    elif need_x:
        print(1)
        print(y)
        return
    elif need_y:
        print(1)
        print(x)
        return
    possible_marks = []
    for i in range(l + 1):
        marks_copy = marks.copy()
        marks_copy.add(i)
        can_measure_x, can_measure_y = False, False
        for j in marks_copy:
            for k in marks_copy:
                if k - j == x:
                    can_measure_x = True
                if k - j == y:
                    can_measure_y = True
        if can_measure_x and can_measure_y:
            possible_marks.append(i)
    if possible_marks:
        print(1)
        print(min(possible_marks))
        return
    print(2)
    print(x, y)

func()
```
This modified program checks all possible combinations of marks and finds the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

So, after modifying the program, the correctness is: Correctness: **True** 

However, since the question asked about the original program, the answer remains: 

Correctness: **False**
