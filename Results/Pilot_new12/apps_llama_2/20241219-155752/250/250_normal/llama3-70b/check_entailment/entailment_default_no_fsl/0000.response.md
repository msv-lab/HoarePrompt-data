Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to determine the minimum number of additional marks needed on the ruler to measure the distances x and y. However, the function does not always find the minimum number of additional marks.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
The function will output:
```
2
185 230
```
However, it would be more efficient to add a single mark at 115 (since 300 - 115 = 185 and 115 + 115 = 230), instead of adding two marks at 185 and 230. 

The function does not consider all possible combinations of marks and their differences, and it does not always find the minimum number of additional marks required. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
