Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given code does not work correctly for all potential cases. It incorrectly handles cases where the target differences are not present in the initial marks and it generates new marks that are sums of existing marks and previous additional marks. However, this approach is not optimal and does not guarantee the minimum number of additional marks required.

For example, if the input is `3 100 20 30` and the marks are `0 50 100`, the function will incorrectly determine that two additional marks are needed, `20` and `30`, whereas only one mark, `20`, is sufficient to measure both `20` and `30` by using the existing mark `50`.

Additionally, the code does not check if the target differences can be measured by using the existing marks in a different way, such as using the difference between two marks to measure the target difference. This oversight can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should use a more sophisticated approach, such as checking all possible combinations of existing marks to see if the target differences can be measured, and then adding the minimum number of additional marks required to measure the target differences.
