You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if we have the following input:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```
The program correctly outputs:
```
0
```
However, if we have the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```
The program correctly outputs:
```
1
230
```
But if we have the following input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```
The program correctly outputs:
```
2
185 230
```
But if we have the following input:
```
2 300 120 180
0 300
```
The program will output:
```
2
120 180
```
However, it's possible to add only one mark, at position 120, because then you can measure 120 (0 to 120), and 180 (120 to 300). 

So the program does not find the minimum number of marks needed in all cases. 

This is because the program simply checks if the distances x and y can be measured with the current marks, and if not, it adds the distances x and y as new marks. But it does not consider the possibility that adding one mark might be enough to measure both distances.

A correct program should try to find the minimum number of marks needed to measure both distances x and y. It should check all possible combinations of marks and find the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

The current program does not do this, so it is incorrect. 

To fix this, we need to change the program to check all possible combinations of marks and find the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

Here is an example of how we can modify the program:
```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in marks:
        for j in marks:
            if j - i == x:
                need_x = True
            if j - i == y:
                need_y = True
    if need_x and need_y:
        print(0)
        return
    elif need_x:
        print(1)
        print(y)
        return
    elif need_y:
        print(1)
        print(x)
        return
    possible_marks = []
    for i in range(l + 1):
        marks_copy = marks.copy()
        marks_copy.add(i)
        can_measure_x, can_measure_y = False, False
        for j in marks_copy:
            for k in marks_copy:
                if k - j == x:
                    can_measure_x = True
                if k - j == y:
                    can_measure_y = True
        if can_measure_x and can_measure_y:
            possible_marks.append(i)
    if possible_marks:
        print(1)
        print(min(possible_marks))
        return
    print(2)
    print(x, y)

func()
```
This modified program checks all possible combinations of marks and finds the combination that requires the minimum number of additional marks. 

So, after modifying the program, the correctness is: Correctness: **True** 

However, since the question asked about the original program, the answer remains: 

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 <... < a_{n} = l), representing the distances of the marks from the origin on the ruler, where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
