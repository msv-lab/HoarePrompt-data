Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases. 

The main issue with the program is that it tries to add all possible sums of existing marks and additional marks, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The problem description only requires us to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y.

The program should simply add x to the additional marks if it cannot be measured with the existing marks, and then check if y can be measured with the existing marks and the additional mark x. If not, it should add y to the additional marks.

Here is a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input:
```
4 10 3 5
0 1 2 10
```
In this case, the program should add 3 to the additional marks because it cannot be measured with the existing marks. However, after adding 3, the program will also add 1 + 3 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5, and other unnecessary marks, which is not what the problem description asks for.

To fix the program, we need to modify it to only add the minimum number of additional marks necessary to measure the distances x and y. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in marks:
        for j in marks:
            if j - i == x:
                need_x = True
            if j - i == y:
                need_y = True

    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        if x in additional_marks and y - x in marks:
            pass
        else:
            additional_marks.append(y)

    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
```
This corrected version of the program only adds the minimum number of additional marks necessary to measure the distances x and y, as required by the problem description.
