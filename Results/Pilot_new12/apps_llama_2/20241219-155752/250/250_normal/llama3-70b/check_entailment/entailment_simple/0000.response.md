Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The issue with the program lies in the logic of adding additional marks. According to the problem description, the task is to determine the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y. 

However, the given program does not always provide the minimum number of additional marks. 

For example, if x and y can be obtained by adding a single mark to the ruler (i.e., there exists an integer z such that z and z + x are both in the ruler or z and z + y are both in the ruler), the program will still add two marks (x and y) even though one mark is sufficient.

Another issue is that after adding the initial additional marks (x and/or y), the program attempts to add more marks by summing the existing marks with the additional marks. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results, as it can add more marks than necessary.

To fix this, the program should be modified to find the minimum number of additional marks required to measure x and y. It can do this by checking if there exists a mark z such that z and z + x are both in the ruler or z and z + y are both in the ruler. If such a mark exists, it should add only one mark (the minimum required to measure both x and y). If no such mark exists, it should add two marks (x and y). 

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
        
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x and not need_y:
        # check if we can add a single mark to measure both x and y
        for z in marks:
            if z + x <= l and z + x not in marks and (z + x) - z == x and (z + x) - z < y <= l:
                # check if we can measure y with z + x
                for m in marks:
                    if (z + x) - m == y:
                        additional_marks.append(z + x)
                        break
        if not additional_marks:
            additional_marks.append(x)
            additional_marks.append(y)
    elif not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    elif not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
        
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
```
