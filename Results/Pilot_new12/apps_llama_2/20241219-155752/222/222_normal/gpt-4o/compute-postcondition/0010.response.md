The code `i += 2 * k + 1` increments the value of `i` by `2 * k + 1`. The initial value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`, so the new value of `i` is `(4 * k + 3) + (2 * k + 1)`, which simplifies to `6 * k + 4`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `4 * k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, and `i` is `6 * k + 4`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `4 * k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, and `i` is `6 * k + 4`**
