To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the pattern in the given output states after each iteration.

1. Initially, `positions` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.
2. After the first iteration, `positions` contains the element 1 (which is the initial value of `i`), and `i` becomes `2 * k + 2`.
3. After the second iteration, `positions` contains two elements: 1 and `2 * k + 2` (which were the values of `i` at the start of each iteration), and `i` becomes `4 * k + 3`.
4. After the third iteration, `positions` contains three elements: 1, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, and `i` becomes `6 * k + 4`.

From this pattern, we can infer that `positions` accumulates values of `i` at the start of each iteration, and `i` increments by `2 * k + 1` after each iteration.

The loop condition is `i <= n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000. 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `i` after each iteration can be represented as `i = 1 + (2 * k + 1) * (iteration - 1)`, where `iteration` is the current iteration number starting from 1.

Let's find the maximum number of iterations `max_iterations` such that `i` does not exceed `n`. The condition for the loop to execute the `max_iterations`-th time is `1 + (2 * k + 1) * (max_iterations - 1) <= n`.

Given the nature of the problem, the total number of iterations can be calculated by finding the largest `max_iterations` such that the inequality holds true.

Since `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1` in each iteration, we can see that the sequence of numbers added to `positions` will be an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`. The sequence starts with 1.

The final value of `i` will be `1 + (2 * k + 1) * max_iterations`, which must be greater than `n` to stop the loop.

Thus, to find the output state, we consider:

- The list `positions` will contain an arithmetic sequence starting with 1, and with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`. The number of terms in the sequence will depend on how many times the loop executes, which in turn depends on the values of `n` and `k`.
- The loop control variable `i` will be one step beyond the last term added to `positions`, meaning it will be the next number in the sequence after the last term that was less than or equal to `n`.

To calculate the exact output state, including the final value of `i` and the contents of `positions`, we need to determine how many iterations the loop performs based on `n` and `k`. However, without specific values for `n` and `k`, we describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`positions` is a list containing an arithmetic sequence starting with 1 and a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, with the number of terms determined by the largest integer `max_iterations` such that `1 + (2 * k + 1) * (max_iterations - 1) <= n`. The final value of `i` is `1 + (2 * k + 1) * max_iterations`, which is greater than `n`.**
