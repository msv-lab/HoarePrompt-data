The code appends the value of `i` to the `positions` list. Given that `i` is `2 * k + 2` and `positions` initially contains a single element which is 1, after the execution of the code, `positions` will contain two elements: 1 and `2 * k + 2`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `k`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` >= `2k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing two elements: 1 and `2 * k + 2`, and `i` is `2 * k + 2`**
