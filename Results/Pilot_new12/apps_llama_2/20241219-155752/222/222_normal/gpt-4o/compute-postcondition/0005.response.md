To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i <= n`.

Given that `i` is `2 * k + 2`, we can substitute this expression into the loop condition to get `2 * k + 2 <= n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 1000`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `i` is `2 * k + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n` must still be true. Since `i` is `2 * k + 2`, we need to ensure that `2 * k + 2` is less than or equal to `n`. 

Given that `i` has already been calculated as `2 * k + 2` and we are considering the next iteration, `k` must increase by 1 (because the loop body, which is omitted, would presumably increment or modify `k` or `i` in some way that would increase `i` for the next iteration), thus potentially increasing `i` for the next iteration. 

However, since we're only modifying the state and not executing the loop body, we need to consider what condition must hold for `n` and `k` so that the next iteration can occur.

Since `i` is `2 * k + 2`, for the next iteration, `i` would be `2 * (k+1) + 2 = 2k + 4`. For the loop to execute again, `2k + 4` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

Thus, the condition on `n` and `k` for the next iteration to occur is that `n` must be greater than or equal to `2k + 4`. Given that `i` is `2 * k + 2` and we're looking at the condition for the next iteration, `n` must be at least `2k + 4` to satisfy the loop condition.

The state of `positions` as a list containing a single element which is 1 does not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` >= `2k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `i` is `2 * k + 2`**
