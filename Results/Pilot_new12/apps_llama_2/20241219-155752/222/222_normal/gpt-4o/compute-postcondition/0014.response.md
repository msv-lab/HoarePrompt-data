The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, with the constraints that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000. 

However, since the specific return values or conditions for `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact return behavior based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. 

Given the format and the information provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation for the return without specific conditions or values.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, with the constraints that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
