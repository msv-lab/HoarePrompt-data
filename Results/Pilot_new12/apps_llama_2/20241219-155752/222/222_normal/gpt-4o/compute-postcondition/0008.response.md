To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's examine the condition of the `while` loop and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is `i <= n`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration. 

Given states:
- `n` is a positive integer and `n >= 2k + 4`
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `positions` is a list containing two elements: 1 and `2 * k + 2`
- `i` is `4 * k + 3`

Since the loop condition depends only on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n` for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `4 * k + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented in such a way that it is still less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n >= 2k + 4`, we need to adjust our understanding of `n`'s relationship to `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

If `i` is `4 * k + 3` and needs to be incremented (let's assume by 1 for the simplest case, as the increment amount is not specified), then for the next iteration, `i` would be `4 * k + 4`. 

For the loop to execute with `i = 4 * k + 4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `4 * k + 4` to satisfy the condition `i <= n`. 

Thus, the adjustment needed for `n` is that it must be at least `4 * k + 4` or more for the loop to execute one more time, given that `i` has been incremented.

The state of `positions` and the exact value of `k` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need adjustment based on the information provided.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `4 * k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing two elements: 1 and `2 * k + 2`, and `i` is `4 * k + 3`**
