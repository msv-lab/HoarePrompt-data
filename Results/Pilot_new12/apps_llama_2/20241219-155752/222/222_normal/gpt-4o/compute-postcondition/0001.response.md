The variable `i` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, and `i` is 1**
