The code `i += 2 * k + 1` increments the value of `i` by `2 * k + 1`. The initial value of `i` is `2 * k + 2`. 

So, `i` becomes `2 * k + 2 + 2 * k + 1`, which simplifies to `4 * k + 3`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and `n` >= `2k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing two elements: 1 and `2 * k + 2`, and `i` is `4 * k + 3`.
