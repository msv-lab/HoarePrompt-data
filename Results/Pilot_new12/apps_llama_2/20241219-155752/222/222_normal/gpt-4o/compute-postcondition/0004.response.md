The code increments the value of `i` by `2 * k + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 1, and `k` is a non-negative integer. 

So, `i` becomes `1 + 2 * k + 1` which is `2 * k + 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `i` is `2 * k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `i` is `2 * k + 2`**
