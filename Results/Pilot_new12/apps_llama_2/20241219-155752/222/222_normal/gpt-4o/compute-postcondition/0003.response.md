The code `positions.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the `positions` list. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.

After executing the code, the value of `i` is added to the `positions` list. So, `positions` is now a list containing the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `k` is a non-negative integer and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `i` is 1**
