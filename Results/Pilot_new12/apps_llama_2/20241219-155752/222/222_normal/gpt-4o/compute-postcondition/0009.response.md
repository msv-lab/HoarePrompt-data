The code `positions.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `positions`. The value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`. 

The states of the variables `n` and `k` are not affected. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to `4 * k + 4`, and `k` is still a non-negative integer. 

The list `positions` initially contains two elements: `1` and `2 * k + 2`. After appending `i`, it now contains three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`.

The value of `i` is still `4 * k + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `4 * k + 4`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3`, and `i` is `4 * k + 3`.**
