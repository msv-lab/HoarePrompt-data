The function `func_1` generates an arithmetic sequence starting with 1 and a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, where `k` is a non-negative integer, and appends terms to the sequence as long as the current term is less than or equal to a given positive integer `n`. It then prints the number of terms in the sequence and the sequence itself, separated by spaces. The sequence's length is determined by the largest integer `max_iterations` such that `1 + (2 * k + 1) * (max_iterations - 1) <= n`. The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, within the constraints 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, and does not return a value, instead printing the results directly. The final state of the program includes the printed sequence and its length, with the sequence itself being a list of integers stored in the `positions` variable.
