Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's why:

1. The problem asks to minimize the number of actions (turning skewers) needed to turn over all n skewers, where each action turns k closest skewers from each side of the turned skewer.

2. The program achieves this by generating a list of positions to turn, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2*k + 1. This is because turning a skewer will turn all the skewers that are k positions to the left and right, effectively covering a range of 2*k + 1 skewers.

3. The program continues to generate positions until it exceeds the total number of skewers (n).

4. The number of positions generated is the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers, since each action covers the maximum possible range of skewers.

5. The program then prints the number of actions required and the list of positions to turn, which is the solution to the problem.

This solution works because it ensures that every skewer is turned at least once, and it minimizes the number of actions required by covering the maximum possible range of skewers with each action. 

For example, given n = 7 and k = 2, the program will output:

2
1 6

This is because turning skewer 1 will turn skewers 1, 2, and 3, and turning skewer 6 will turn skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7, which covers all skewers.

Similarly, given n = 5 and k = 1, the program will output:

2
1 4

This is because turning skewer 1 will turn skewers 1 and 2, and turning skewer 4 will turn skewers 3, 4, and 5, which covers all skewers.

In general, the program will always generate the correct solution for any valid input (n and k), which is why it is correct.
