Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. The program generates a sequence of positions to turn over the skewers, with each position being `2 * k + 1` units apart. This approach ensures that all skewers are turned over with the minimum possible number of actions.

The code correctly handles the cases where `n` and `k` are within the specified constraints (1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000). The examples provided in the problem description (e.g., `n = 7` and `k = 2`, `n = 5` and `k = 1`) are also handled correctly by the program.

The program assumes that the input will be valid and does not include error handling for invalid inputs. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will always be valid.

The logic behind the program is clear and agrees with the problem description. The program uses a simple arithmetic sequence to generate the positions, and the sequence's length is determined by the largest integer `max_iterations` such that `1 + (2 * k + 1) * (max_iterations - 1) <= n`.

Overall, based on the provided examples and the problem description, the program appears to be correct and should handle all valid inputs correctly.
