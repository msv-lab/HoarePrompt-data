Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to correctly solve the problem of turning over all skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. 

Here is the explanation of why the program works as expected:
1. The program takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of skewers and `k` represents the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.
2. It uses a while loop to calculate the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over. The loop starts at skewer 1 and increments by `2 * k + 1` each time, which means that each turn operation will flip `2 * k + 1` skewers.
3. The positions of the skewers that need to be turned over are stored in the `positions` list.
4. The program prints the length of the `positions` list, which represents the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers.
5. Finally, it prints the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over, separated by spaces.

After analyzing the program, it seems that it handles all possible cases correctly. For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is the correct solution. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program outputs `2` and `1 4`, which is also correct.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. It takes into account the fact that each turn operation flips `2 * k + 1` skewers, and it uses this information to determine the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over.

Overall, based on the provided program and the problem description, it seems that the program is correct and handles all possible cases correctly.
