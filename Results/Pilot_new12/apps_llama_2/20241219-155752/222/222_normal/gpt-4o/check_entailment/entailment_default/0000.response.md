Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided generates an arithmetic sequence of skewer positions to turn over, with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, where `k` is the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step. This approach ensures that all skewers are turned over in the minimum number of actions possible.

The sequence starts at skewer 1 and increments by `2 * k + 1` until it reaches or exceeds the total number of skewers `n`. The length of the sequence represents the minimum number of actions needed.

The provided output hints agree with the code and demonstrate a correct understanding of the algorithm. The examples in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For instance, the first example with `n = 7` and `k = 2` requires two actions to turn over all skewers, and the code correctly outputs `1 6` as the positions to turn over.

Similarly, the second example with `n = 5` and `k = 1` requires two actions, and the code outputs `1 4` as the positions to turn over.

The code handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints (`1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`) and does not require error checking for invalid inputs, as per the problem statement. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the specified constraints.
