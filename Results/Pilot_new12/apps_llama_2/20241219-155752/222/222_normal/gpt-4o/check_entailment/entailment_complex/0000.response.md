Correctness: **True**

The program always does what the problem description says. It correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers and prints the corresponding skewer numbers.

Here's why:

1. The program starts by reading the input values `n` and `k`, which represent the number of skewers and the number of skewers turned in each step, respectively.

2. The `func_1` function generates an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of `2 * k + 1` starting from 1. This sequence represents the skewer numbers that need to be turned over to ensure all skewers are turned over in the minimum number of steps.

3. The `while` loop inside `func_1` appends terms to the sequence as long as the current term is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that the sequence covers all skewers.

4. After the loop, the program prints the length of the sequence (representing the minimum number of actions) and the sequence itself (representing the skewer numbers to be turned over).

For every potential case, the program follows the problem description. It correctly handles the constraints `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`, and it does not return an error for any valid input.

For example, given `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program correctly outputs:

```
2
1 6
```

This is because turning over skewers 1 and 6 will result in all skewers being turned over (skewers 1, 2, and 3 are turned over when skewer 1 is turned, and skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7 are turned over when skewer 6 is turned).

Similarly, given `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program correctly outputs:

```
2
1 4
```

This is because turning over skewers 1 and 4 will result in all skewers being turned over (skewers 1, 2, and 3 are turned over when skewer 1 is turned, and skewers 3, 4, and 5 are turned over when skewer 4 is turned).

In summary, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases within the given constraints.
