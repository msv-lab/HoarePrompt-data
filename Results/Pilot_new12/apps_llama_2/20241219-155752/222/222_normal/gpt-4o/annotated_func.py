#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `positions` is a list containing an arithmetic sequence starting with 1 and a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, with the number of terms determined by the largest integer `max_iterations` such that `1 + (2 * k + 1) * (max_iterations - 1) <= n`. The final value of `i` is `1 + (2 * k + 1) * max_iterations`, which is greater than `n`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` generates an arithmetic sequence starting with 1 and a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, where `k` is a non-negative integer, and appends terms to the sequence as long as the current term is less than or equal to a given positive integer `n`. It then prints the number of terms in the sequence and the sequence itself, separated by spaces. The sequence's length is determined by the largest integer `max_iterations` such that `1 + (2 * k + 1) * (max_iterations - 1) <= n`. The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, within the constraints 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000, and does not return a value, instead printing the results directly. The final state of the program includes the printed sequence and its length, with the sequence itself being a list of integers stored in the `positions` variable.
