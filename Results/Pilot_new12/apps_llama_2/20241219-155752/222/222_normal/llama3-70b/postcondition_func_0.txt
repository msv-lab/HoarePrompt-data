The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It calculates the value of `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and generates a list `res` containing `l` elements of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`. If `l` is 0, an empty list is generated. The function then prints the value of `l` and the elements of the list `res`. The function does not return any values, instead, it prints the results directly to the console. The final state of the program includes the printed values of `l` and `res`, while the original input values `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The function handles potential edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` and `k` result in a value of `l` equal to 0, in which case an empty list is printed.
