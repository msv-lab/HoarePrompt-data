Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements defined in the problem description. The problem asks to find the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers, and the program correctly calculates this value as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The problem states that when a skewer is turned, the `k` closest skewers on each side are also turned. This means that each action turns `2 * k + 1` skewers.
2. To find the minimum number of actions, we need to divide the total number of skewers `n` by the number of skewers turned in each action `2 * k + 1`. This is exactly what the program does by calculating `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
3. The program then generates a list `res` of skewers that need to be turned, where each skewer is `2 * k + 1` positions apart from the previous one. This ensures that all skewers are turned with the minimum number of actions.
4. Finally, the program prints the minimum number of actions `l` and the list of skewers that need to be turned `res`.

The program handles potential edge cases, such as when `k` is 0 or `n` and `k` result in a value of `l` equal to 0. In these cases, an empty list is printed, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and provides the expected output for every potential case.
