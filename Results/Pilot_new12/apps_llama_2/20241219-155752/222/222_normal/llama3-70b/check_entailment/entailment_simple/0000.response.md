Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers and prints the corresponding skewer numbers.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The formula `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` calculates the minimum number of actions needed. This is because each action turns `k * 2 + 1` skewers, so we need to divide `n` by `k * 2 + 1` and round up to the nearest integer.

2. The loop `for i in range(l):` generates the skewer numbers that need to be turned over in each action. Each skewer number is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which is the first skewer of the next group of `k * 2 + 1` skewers.

3. The `print` statements correctly output the minimum number of actions and the corresponding skewer numbers.

The program meets the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly calculates the minimum number of actions and the corresponding skewer numbers, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program correctly outputs:

```
2
1 6
```

This corresponds to turning over skewers 1, 2, and 3 in the first action, and skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the second action, which meets the problem description.

Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program correctly outputs:

```
2
1 4
```

This corresponds to turning over skewers 1 and 2 in the first action, and skewers 3, 4, and 5 in the second action, which meets the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
