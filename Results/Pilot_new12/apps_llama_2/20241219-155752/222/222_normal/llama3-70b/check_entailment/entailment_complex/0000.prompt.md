You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `k` is the original input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` is a list containing `l` elements of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`, or an empty list if `l` is 0
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It calculates the value of `l` as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and generates a list `res` containing `l` elements of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`. If `l` is 0, an empty list is generated. The function then prints the value of `l` and the elements of the list `res`. The function does not return any values, instead, it prints the results directly to the console. The final state of the program includes the printed values of `l` and `res`, while the original input values `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The function handles potential edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` and `k` result in a value of `l` equal to 0, in which case an empty list is printed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
