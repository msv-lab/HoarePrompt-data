Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The code generates a list of skewer indices to turn over based on the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, which calculates the minimum number of turns required to cover all skewers. However, the program does not take into account the actual effect of each turn on the state of the skewers.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 1`. The program will output `2` and the skewer indices `1` and `4`. However, turning skewer `1` will turn over skewers `1` and `2`, and turning skewer `4` will turn over skewers `4` and `5`. This will leave skewer `3` in its initial state, which is not the desired outcome.

A correct solution would need to take into account the actual effect of each turn on the state of the skewers and ensure that all skewers are turned over. The given program does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect.

One possible correct approach would be to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively turns over the skewer that will turn over the most skewers that are still in their initial state. This would ensure that all skewers are turned over in the minimum number of turns.

In the given code, the line `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` simply calculates the index of the skewer to turn over based on the formula, without considering the actual effect of the turn on the state of the skewers. This is a simplification that does not work for all cases, and therefore, the program is incorrect.
