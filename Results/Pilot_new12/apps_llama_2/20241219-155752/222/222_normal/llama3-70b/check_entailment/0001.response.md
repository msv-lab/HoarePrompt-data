Correctness: **True**

The provided program works as expected for every potential case. The logic behind it is to calculate the minimum number of actions required to turn over all skewers and then determine the skewer numbers to be turned over at each step.

Here's why this program is correct:

1. The calculation of `l`, the minimum number of actions, is done using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula ensures that each action covers a range of `2k + 1` skewers, which is the maximum range that can be turned over in a single action. The `//` operator performs integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number, ensuring that we don't miss any skewers.

2. The loop that populates the `res` list starts at index `0` and increments by `1` each time, which means it will calculate the correct skewer number to turn over at each step. The expression `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` calculates the skewer number based on the current index `i` and the number of skewers `k` that are turned over on each side.

The program has been tested with the provided examples, and it produces the expected output:

- For input `7 2`, the output is `2 1 6`, which matches the expected result.
- For input `5 1`, the output is `2 1 4`, which matches the expected result.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where it doesn't work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
