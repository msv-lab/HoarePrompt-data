Correctness: **True**.

The provided code implements a solution to the problem of turning over all skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. The code calculates the minimum number of actions required (`l`) and generates a list of skewer numbers to be turned over at each step (`res`).

The code correctly handles the calculation of `l` by using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, which ensures that the minimum number of actions is always calculated correctly.

The generation of the `res` list is also correct, as it uses a loop to append the skewer numbers to be turned over at each step. The formula `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` ensures that the correct skewer numbers are always appended to the list.

The code also handles potential edge cases, such as when `k` is 0 or when `n` and `k` result in a value of `l` equal to 0.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, I was unable to find any cases where the code does not work as expected. The provided examples in the problem description also match the output of the code, which further supports the correctness of the code.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
