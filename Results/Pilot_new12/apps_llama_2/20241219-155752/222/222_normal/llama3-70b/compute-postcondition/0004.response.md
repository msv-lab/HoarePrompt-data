To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 0
- `res` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `(n + k - 1)` must be greater than 0

Given Code:
```python
res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
```

The code appends a new value to the `res` list. This value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the list `res` which was initially empty, now contains a single element which is `1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) do not change because of this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing a single element which is `1`, `i` is 0, and `(n + k - 1)` is greater than 0**
