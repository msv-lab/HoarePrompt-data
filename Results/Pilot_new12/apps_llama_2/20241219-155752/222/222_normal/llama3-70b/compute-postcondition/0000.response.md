The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. `n` is assigned the first integer value from the input and `k` is assigned the second integer value from the input. The previous precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer may not hold after the execution of the code, as the new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
