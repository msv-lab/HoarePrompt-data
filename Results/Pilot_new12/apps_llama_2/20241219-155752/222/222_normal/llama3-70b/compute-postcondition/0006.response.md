To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 1, `res` is a list containing a single element which is `1`, `i` is 1, and `(n + k - 1)` is greater than 0.

The given code is: `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`

After executing this code, the list `res` will have an additional element which is the result of `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. 

Substituting `i = 1` into the expression, we get: `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = k * 2 + 1 + 1 = k * 2 + 2`.

Therefore, the new element appended to `res` is `k * 2 + 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

So, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 1, `res` is a list containing two elements which are `1` and `k * 2 + 2`, `i` is 1, and `(n + k - 1)` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 1, `res` is a list containing two elements which are `1` and `k * 2 + 2`, `i` is 1, and `(n + k - 1)` is greater than 0**
