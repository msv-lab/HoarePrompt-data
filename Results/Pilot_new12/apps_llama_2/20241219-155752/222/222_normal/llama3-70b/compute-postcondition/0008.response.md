To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer,
- `k` is an input integer,
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 2,
- `res` is a list containing two elements which are `1` and `k * 2 + 2`,
- `i` is 2,
- `(n + k - 1)` is greater than `2 * (k * 2 + 1)`.

The code snippet is `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)`.

This line of code appends a new element to the `res` list. The new element is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation becomes `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `k * 2 + 1` is a common factor in the calculation, which we can denote as `factor = k * 2 + 1`.
- Then, `2 * factor + 1 = 2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 4k + 2 + 1 = 4k + 3`.

So, the new element appended to `res` is `4k + 3`.

The states of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Only the `res` list is modified by adding a new element.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer,
- `k` is an input integer,
- `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 2,
- `res` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `k * 2 + 2`, and `4k + 3`,
- `i` is 2,
- `(n + k - 1)` is greater than `2 * (k * 2 + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 2, `res` is a list containing three elements: `1`, `k * 2 + 2`, and `4k + 3`, `i` is 2, and `(n + k - 1)` is greater than `2 * (k * 2 + 1)`**
