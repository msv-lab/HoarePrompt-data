The provided code snippet is a print statement, which does not modify any variables but outputs the value of `l` to the console. 

The value of `l` is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, which remains unchanged after the print statement. The `res` list, containing `l` elements of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`, or an empty list if `l` is 0, also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the original input integer, `k` is the original input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` is a list containing `l` elements of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`, or an empty list if `l` is 0, and the value of `l` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `k` is the original input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` is a list containing `l` elements of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`, or an empty list if `l` is 0, and the value of `l` has been printed.**
