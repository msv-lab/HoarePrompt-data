It appears that there is a discrepancy in the provided information. The function definition is given as `def func():`, which indicates that the function does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints specify that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer.

Assuming that the function actually accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, the corrected function definition would be `def func(n, k):`. 

With this assumption, the function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. 

Since the output cases are not provided, the functionality of the function `func` can only be described based on the given input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer, but the return values are not specified.**
