According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is 2 and `l` must be greater than 2. Since `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, for `l` to be greater than 2, `(n + k - 1)` must be greater than `2 * (k * 2 + 1)` and since `(n + k - 1)` is already greater than 0, it will still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and is greater than 2, `res` is a list containing two elements which are `1` and `k * 2 + 2`, `i` is 2, and `(n + k - 1)` is greater than `2 * (k * 2 + 1)`**
