Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

The problem description asks to determine if a given sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. However, the program only checks if the total sum of the digits can be divided into two equal parts, and if these parts can be formed by non-intersecting segments. 

The issue with the program is that it assumes that the segments must have a sum equal to half of the total sum. However, the problem description does not make this assumption. The segments can have any sum, as long as they are equal and the entire sequence can be divided into two or more of these segments.

For example, consider the sequence "1221". This sequence can be divided into two segments "12" and "21" with equal sums (1+2 = 2+1 = 3), but the program will not recognize this because the sum of "12" is not half of the total sum of the sequence.

To fix this issue, the program would need to check all possible segment lengths and sums, not just the sum equal to half of the total sum. This would require a more complex algorithm that checks all possible divisions of the sequence into segments, and verifies if any of these divisions result in segments with equal sums. 

Here is an example of how the corrected function could look:

```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        segments = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
        if segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function checks all possible target sums from 1 to the total sum of the sequence, and for each target sum, it checks if the sequence can be divided into two or more segments with this sum. If it finds such a division, it returns True. If it checks all possible target sums and does not find a valid division, it returns False.
