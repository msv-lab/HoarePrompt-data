Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to determine if the given sequence of digits can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The program attempts to divide the string into segments with equal sums, but it only checks if the sum of each segment is equal to half of the total sum of digits in the ticket string.

However, the problem description does not require the sum of each segment to be half of the total sum. It only requires the sums of the segments to be equal to each other. 

For example, the ticket "73452" can be divided into segments "7", "34", and "52" with sums 7, 7, and 7, respectively. However, the program will not consider this as a valid division because the sum of each segment (7) is not half of the total sum (24).

To fix this, the program should be modified to check all possible segment sums, not just half of the total sum. It should also check all possible segment divisions, not just the ones that start from the beginning of the string.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly solve the problem:

```python
def func_1(ticket):
    def can_divide(ticket, segment_sum):
        curr_sum = 0
        segments = 0
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == segment_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
        return segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0

    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for segment_sum in range(1, total_sum // 2 + 1):
        if total_sum % segment_sum == 0 and can_divide(ticket, segment_sum):
            return True
    return False
```

This version of the function checks all possible segment sums and returns True as soon as it finds one that works. If it checks all possible segment sums and does not find one that works, it returns False.
