Correctness: **False**

The code does not work for every potential case. It only checks if the string can be divided into segments where the sum of digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum of digits in the string. However, this is not the only condition for a string to be considered "lucky" according to the problem description. A string is considered "lucky" if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, not necessarily half of the total sum.

For example, the input string "123456" should return "YES" because it can be divided into segments "12", "12", "12", "12" with equal sums. However, the code will return "NO" because it only checks for segments with sums equal to half of the total sum.

The function `func_1` is also missing the possibility of dividing the string into more than two segments, not necessarily with sums equal to half of the total sum. It should check for all possible segment lengths, not just segments with sums equal to half of the total sum.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
