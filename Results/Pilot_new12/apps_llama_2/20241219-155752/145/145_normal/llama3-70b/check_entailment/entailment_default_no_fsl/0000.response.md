Correctness: **False**

The given code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the code only checks if the ticket can be divided into segments with sums equal to half of the total sum of digits. However, the problem description states that the ticket should be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, without specifying that the sum of each segment must be half of the total sum.

For example, consider the ticket "350178" which can be divided into three segments "350", "17", and "8" with equal sums (3+5+0 = 1+7 = 8). The given code would not correctly identify this ticket as lucky because the sum of each segment is not half of the total sum.

To correctly solve this problem, the code should check all possible segmentations of the ticket and verify if any of them have equal sums. The current implementation is too restrictive and does not cover all the cases mentioned in the problem description.
