You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if the total sum of the ticket can be divided into two equal segments. However, according to the problem description, a ticket is considered lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The current implementation does not consider cases where the ticket can be divided into more than two segments.

For example, the program would return False for the input "350178" (3+5+0=1+7=8), because it cannot be divided into two segments with equal sums, but it can be divided into three segments with equal sums.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check for all possible segment divisions, not just two equal segments. The current implementation only checks for a specific case and does not handle the general case described in the problem description. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to handle the general case:
```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        curr_sum = 0
        segments = 0
        valid = True
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
            elif curr_sum > target_sum:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This modified version checks for all possible target sums and returns True as soon as it finds a valid division into two or more segments. If no valid division is found, it returns False.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `ticket` and returns `True` if the string can be divided into two or more segments where the sum of digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string has a length of less than 2 or the sum of its digits is odd. In such cases, it immediately returns `False`. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where the input string cannot be divided into two or more segments with equal sums. The function performs the following actions: it calculates the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string, checks if the sum is even, attempts to divide the string into segments with equal sums, and returns a boolean value based on the number of complete segments found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
