You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is even
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the remaining digits in `ticket` that do not form a complete segment, and `segments` is the number of complete segments found in `ticket`. If the loop does not execute, `ticket` is an empty string or has one digit, `total_sum` and `target_sum` are 0 or the single digit divided by 2, `curr_sum` is 0, and `segments` is 0.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if the number of complete segments in 'ticket' is 2 or more; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `ticket` and returns `True` if the string can be divided into two or more segments where the sum of digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string has a length of less than 2 or the sum of its digits is odd. In such cases, it immediately returns `False`. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where the input string cannot be divided into two or more segments with equal sums. The function performs the following actions: it calculates the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string, checks if the sum is even, attempts to divide the string into segments with equal sums, and returns a boolean value based on the number of complete segments found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
