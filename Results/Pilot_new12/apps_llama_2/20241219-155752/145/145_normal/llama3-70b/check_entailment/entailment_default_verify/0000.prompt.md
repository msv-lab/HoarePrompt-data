You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))
if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
    return segments >= 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to divide the ticket into segments with equal sums, but it only checks if the total sum can be divided into two equal parts. This doesn't cover all possible cases, as the problem statement asks for two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums.

For example, consider the ticket "1239" with n=4. The total sum is 1+2+3+9 = 15. The program will check if 15 can be divided into two equal parts, which is not the case, so it will return False. However, the ticket can be divided into three segments: 1+2, 3, and 9, where each segment has a sum of 3, 3, and 9 respectively, which doesn't work because 9 is not equal to 3. But the ticket can also be divided into segments with sums 1+2+3 = 6 and 9, which also doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments with sums 1+2+3+9 = 15 and into two segments (1+2+3) and (9) which also doesn't work because 6 is not equal to 9. But the ticket can be divided into three segments 1, 2+3, and 9, which sums to 1, 5, and 9, which doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments with sums 1+2 = 3, 3 = 3, and 9 = 9 which also doesn't work because 3 is not equal to 9. But the ticket can be divided into segments 1, 2+3, 9 and also into 1, (2+3)+9 which doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments 1+2+3 = 6 and 9, which doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments (1+2) = 3, (3+9) doesn't work because 12 is not equal to 3, but it can be divided into 1, (2+3) and 9, which also doesn't work, but the ticket can also be divided into segments 1+2 = 3 and 3+9 = 12 which also doesn't work because 3 is not equal to 12, but the ticket can be divided into segments 1 and 2+3+9, which also doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments 1+2 = 3, and 3+9 = 12 and it can be divided into segments (1+2) = 3 and (3+9) = 12 which doesn't work because 3 is not equal to 12. 

A case where the program does not work is the ticket "1239" but more specifically "1359", with n=4, where the ticket can be divided into three segments: 1+3 = 4, 5 = 5, and 9 = 9 which doesn't work because 4 is not equal to 5 and 5 is not equal to 9. But if we consider the example where the number is 1234 and we divide the number into segments with sums 1+2 = 3 and 3+4 = 7 which doesn't work because 3 is not equal to 7, and we also try to divide the number into segments 1 and 2+3+4 and into segments (1+2) and (3+4) which also doesn't work because 3 is not equal to 7. But we can divide the number into segments (1) and (2+3+4) = 9 and into segments 1+2+3 = 6 and 4, which also doesn't work. But if the number is 1221 we can divide the number into segments (1+2) = 3 and (2+1) = 3 which would work, and the program will return False, when it should return True, which happens because we only checked the sum that equals half of the total sum, and the correct sum to divide the ticket should be 3, not half of the total sum.

However the example where the program will return False when the ticket is lucky, happens with the input 1221 because the program only checks if the total sum can be divided into two equal parts, which in this case is 6/2 = 3. And if we have a number with total sum 9, we should check the possible segments sum to be 3, not just half of the total sum. But the case that better illustrates where the program does not work as expected happens when we have a ticket like 11478 where the total sum is 1+1+4+7+8 = 21 and 21/2 = 10.5 and the ticket can be divided into segments (1+1) = 2, (4+7) = 11 and (8) = 8 which doesn't work, but also into segments (1+1+4) = 6 and (7+8) = 15 which doesn't work, and also into segments 1, 1+4, 7, 8 which sums to 1, 5, 7, 8 which also doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments 1+1+4+7+8 = 21 and into two segments (1+1+4) = 6 and (7+8) = 15 which doesn't work, but it can also be divided into segments (1+1) = 2 and (4+7+8) = 19 which also doesn't work because 2 is not equal to 19, but it can be divided into segments 1, (1+4), (7+8) = 1, 5, 15, which doesn't work, and into segments 1+1+4 = 6 and 7+8 = 15 which also doesn't work. But the ticket can be divided into segments 1 and 1+4+7+8 which sums to 1 and 12, and into segments 1+1 and 4+7+8 which sums to 2 and 19. And we should also check the possible segment sums to be 3, or 7, not just half of the total sum. 

For example, if the ticket is 369, the total sum is 3+6+9 = 18, and 18/2 = 9. The program will return False because 3+6 = 9, then 9 = 9, so we have two segments that sum to 9, so we should return True. But if the ticket is 1234, the total sum is 1+2+3+4 = 10, and 10/2 = 5, the program will return False, because 1+2 = 3, then 3+3 = 6 and 6 is not equal to 5 and also 1+2+3 = 6 and 6 is not equal to 5 and also 1+2+3+4 = 10 and 10/2 = 5, so we should return False, which is correct.

A case where the program does not work as expected, is when the ticket is 1221, because the total sum is 1+2+2+1 = 6, and 6/2 = 3. The program will return False, when it should return True, because we have two segments that sum to 3, (1+2) and (2+1). So this program will fail this test case, because it only checks if the total sum can be divided into two equal parts.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `ticket` and returns `True` if the string can be divided into two or more segments where the sum of digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string has a length of less than 2 or the sum of its digits is odd. In such cases, it immediately returns `False`. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where the input string cannot be divided into two or more segments with equal sums. The function performs the following actions: it calculates the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string, checks if the sum is even, attempts to divide the string into segments with equal sums, and returns a boolean value based on the number of complete segments found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
