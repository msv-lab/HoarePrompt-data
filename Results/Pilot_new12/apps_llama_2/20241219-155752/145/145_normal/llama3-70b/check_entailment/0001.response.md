Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if the total sum of the ticket can be divided into two equal segments. However, according to the problem description, a ticket is considered lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. The current implementation does not consider cases where the ticket can be divided into more than two segments.

For example, the program would return False for the input "350178" (3+5+0=1+7=8), because it cannot be divided into two segments with equal sums, but it can be divided into three segments with equal sums.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check for all possible segment divisions, not just two equal segments. The current implementation only checks for a specific case and does not handle the general case described in the problem description. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to handle the general case:
```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        curr_sum = 0
        segments = 0
        valid = True
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
            elif curr_sum > target_sum:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This modified version checks for all possible target sums and returns True as soon as it finds a valid division into two or more segments. If no valid division is found, it returns False.
