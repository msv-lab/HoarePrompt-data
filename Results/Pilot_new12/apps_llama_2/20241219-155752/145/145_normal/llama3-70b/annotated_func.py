#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is even
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the remaining digits in `ticket` that do not form a complete segment, and `segments` is the number of complete segments found in `ticket`. If the loop does not execute, `ticket` is an empty string or has one digit, `total_sum` and `target_sum` are 0 or the single digit divided by 2, `curr_sum` is 0, and `segments` is 0.
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns True if the number of complete segments in 'ticket' is 2 or more; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `ticket` and returns `True` if the string can be divided into two or more segments where the sum of digits in each segment is equal to half of the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases where the input string has a length of less than 2 or the sum of its digits is odd. In such cases, it immediately returns `False`. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where the input string cannot be divided into two or more segments with equal sums. The function performs the following actions: it calculates the total sum of digits in the `ticket` string, checks if the sum is even, attempts to divide the string into segments with equal sums, and returns a boolean value based on the number of complete segments found.
