The code introduces a new variable `curr_sum` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`ticket` is still a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9. 
`total_sum` is still the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even.
`target_sum` is still `total_sum // 2`.
`curr_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0**
