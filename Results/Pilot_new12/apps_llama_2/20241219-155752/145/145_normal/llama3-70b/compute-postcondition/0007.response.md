To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the initial program state.

The loop statement is: `for digit in ticket:`

From this statement, we can infer that the loop will execute for each character (digit) in the string `ticket`. 

Given the initial states:
- `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- `curr_sum` is 0.
- `segments` is 0.

For the loop to execute, it does not directly depend on `total_sum`, `target_sum`, `curr_sum`, or `segments`. However, these variables are part of the initial state and should be considered as they are when the loop starts. The critical aspect for the loop to execute is that `ticket` must have at least one digit. Since `ticket` is already defined as having a length greater than or equal to 2, this condition is inherently met.

Given that we are at the start of the loop, `digit` would be the first character in `ticket`. Since we are not provided with the specifics of the loop body, we cannot determine how `curr_sum` or `segments` would be modified during the loop, but initially, `digit` is the first digit in `ticket`.

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 0, `digit` is the first digit in `ticket`**
