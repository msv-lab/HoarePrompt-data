Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0 and `segments` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify the variables.***
