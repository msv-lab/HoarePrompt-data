According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ticket` string. If `ticket` has at least 3 digits, the loop can execute again for the third digit. At the end of the last iteration, `ticket` has a length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ticket` must have at least 3 digits, `digit` must be the third digit in `ticket`. The values of `total_sum` and `target_sum` remain the same as they are not dependent on the current digit being processed. 
State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`**
