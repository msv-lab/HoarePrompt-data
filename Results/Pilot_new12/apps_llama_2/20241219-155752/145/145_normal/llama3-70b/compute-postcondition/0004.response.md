The value of `target_sum` is assigned to be half of `total_sum`, using integer division (`//`). Since `total_sum` is even, the result of this division will be an integer. 

Therefore, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, which is an integer since `total_sum` is even.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`**
