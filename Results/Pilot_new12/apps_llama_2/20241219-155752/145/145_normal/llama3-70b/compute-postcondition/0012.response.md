Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is equal to the first digit in `ticket`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.***
