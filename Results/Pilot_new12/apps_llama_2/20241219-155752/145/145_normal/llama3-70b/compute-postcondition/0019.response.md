The code increments the value of `curr_sum` by the value of `digit`. The initial state provides that `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`. 

The value of `curr_sum` is increased by the third digit in `ticket`, so `curr_sum` becomes `curr_sum + digit`. The other variables (`ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, `digit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is `curr_sum + digit`**
