The provided code snippet resets the value of `curr_sum` to 0. 

Given the initial state: 
- `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2
- `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`
- `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`
- Initially, `curr_sum` was incremented by the second digit in `ticket` but now it's reset to 0
- `segments` is incremented by 1

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is incremented by 1**
