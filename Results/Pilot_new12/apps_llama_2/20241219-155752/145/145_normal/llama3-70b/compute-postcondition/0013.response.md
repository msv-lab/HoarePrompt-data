To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is equal to the first digit in `ticket`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

The loop statement is `for digit in ticket:`. This means that the loop iterates over each character (digit) in the `ticket` string.

At the end of the previous iteration, `digit` was the first digit in `ticket`. For the loop to execute again, it needs to move on to the next digit in `ticket`. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `ticket` remains the same as it's the string being iterated over.
- `total_sum` doesn't change because it's the sum of all digits in `ticket`, which hasn't changed.
- `target_sum` also doesn't change because it's calculated from `total_sum`.
- `digit` needs to be the next digit in `ticket` after the one processed in the previous iteration.

The states of `curr_sum` and `segments` are conditional and depend on whether `curr_sum` equals `target_sum` at the end of the previous iteration. However, since we're only adjusting states for the loop to execute one more time based on the loop statement itself, we focus on `ticket` and `digit`. Other variables' states are adjusted based on the loop body, which isn't provided.

Therefore, considering the loop statement and the need for it to execute again:
State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the second digit in `ticket`**
