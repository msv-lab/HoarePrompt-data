The code resets `curr_sum` to 0. The previous value of `curr_sum` was `curr_sum + digit`, but this is no longer valid since `curr_sum` has been reset. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is increased by 1**
