The code increments `segments` by 1. The previous value of `segments` is unknown, so the output state is: 

`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, 
`total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, 
`target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, 
`digit` is the third digit in `ticket`, 
`curr_sum` is `curr_sum + digit`, 
`segments` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 3, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the third digit in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is `curr_sum + digit`, `segments` is increased by 1**
