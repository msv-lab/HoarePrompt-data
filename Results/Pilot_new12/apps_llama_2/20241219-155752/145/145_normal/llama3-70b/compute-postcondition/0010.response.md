The code increments the value of `segments` by 1. The previous value of `segments` is 0, so the new value of `segments` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, `segments` is 1, and `digit` is equal to the first digit in `ticket`, which is also equal to `curr_sum`**
