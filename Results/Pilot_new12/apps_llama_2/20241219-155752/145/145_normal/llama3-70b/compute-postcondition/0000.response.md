The given code calculates the sum of all the digits in the `ticket` string and assigns it to `total_sum`. 

Since `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, the sum of its digits will be an integer greater than or equal to 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length greater than or equal to 2, where each digit is between 0 and 9, `total_sum` is the sum of all the digits in `ticket`**
