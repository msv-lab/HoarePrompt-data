Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly determine whether a given string of digits can be divided into segments of the same sum. 

The issue lies in the fact that the code only checks for segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the ticket. This means that it does not correctly handle cases where the segment length is equal to `n`. 

Another issue is that the `segment_sum` function is called with the `ticket` variable which is not in its scope. The `ticket` variable is passed as an argument to the `func_1` function, but it is not passed to the `segment_sum` function. 

However, the main issue is that the code only checks for segments of the same length, but the problem description does not specify that the segments must be of the same length. It only specifies that the segments must have the same sum. 

For example, if the input is `2112`, the code will not correctly identify that the ticket can be divided into segments `2`, `11`, and `2` with the same sum. 

To fix this, the code needs to be modified to check for all possible segment lengths and combinations, not just segments of the same length. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to correctly solve the problem:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    def segment_sum(start, end):
        return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))

    for target_sum in range(1, sum(int(digit) for digit in ticket) + 1):
        segments = []
        current_sum = 0
        current_segment = []
        for digit in ticket:
            current_sum += int(digit)
            current_segment.append(digit)
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                segments.append(current_segment)
                current_sum = 0
                current_segment = []
        if current_sum == 0 and len(segments) > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This modified function checks for all possible target sums, and for each target sum, it checks if the ticket can be divided into segments with the same sum. If it can, and the number of segments is more than 1, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
