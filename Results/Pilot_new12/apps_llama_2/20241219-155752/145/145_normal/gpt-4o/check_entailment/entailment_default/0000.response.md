Correctness: **False**.

The function initially seems to follow the problem description. However, upon closer inspection, the code has a flaw. The `segment_sum` function is not defined inside the `func_1` function and relies on a global variable `ticket`. This is not a problem given the input and the structure of the task but it does make the code harder to understand. More importantly, the code does not account for the case when the sum of the digits in the first segment is not equal to the sum of the digits in the rest of the ticket, but the rest of the ticket can still be divided into segments with the same sum. This happens when `current_sum == target_sum` is checked before all segments have been considered.

However, the provided code seems to cover most of the potential cases where the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums, including the case when the first segment is of length 1 and the rest of the ticket is divided into segments of the same length. 

But let's consider a different case. If we have a ticket like "121212", the code will not work correctly if we consider the first segment to be of length 3. In this case, `target_sum` will be 4 (1+2+1), and then it will try to divide the rest of the ticket into segments with the same sum. 

Another issue is the scope of `ticket` in `segment_sum` function. It is using it as a global variable. This could potentially lead to problems if the function is used in a different context.

A correct implementation should consider all possible segment lengths, not just from 1 to `n-1`, and also consider the case where the first segment is not the shortest segment.

For example, if the input is "123123", the function should return "YES", because the ticket can be divided into two segments of the same sum, 6. However, the given code does not consider this case correctly.

In conclusion, while the code seems to cover some cases, it does not account for all possible cases, and therefore, it is not correct.
