You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and ticket is a string of digits of length n.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, and for all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, either the sum of the digits cannot be evenly divided into segments of the same sum or there is only one such segment.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns string 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given string of digits (`ticket`) of length `n` can be divided into segments of the same sum for any segment length from 1 to `n-1`. It returns 'YES' if such a division is possible with more than one segment, and 'NO' otherwise. The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `ticket`, where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1 and `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`. After execution, the function will be in one of two states: it will have returned 'YES' if a valid division into segments of the same sum is found, or 'NO' if no such division is possible for all segment lengths or if the division results in only one segment. The function covers all potential segment lengths and considers the sum of digits for each segment, handling cases where the sum of digits cannot be evenly divided into segments of the same sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len(ticket), where ticket is a string of digits representing the golden ticket.
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the 'ticket' string from index 'start' to 'end' (inclusive), where 'start' and 'end' are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len('ticket'), and 'ticket' is a string of digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the digits in a predefined string `ticket` from a specified start index to an end index (inclusive), where both indices are non-negative and the start index is less than or equal to the end index, which in turn is less than the length of the `ticket` string. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns an integer sum. The function assumes that `ticket` is accessible and is a string of digits. The function does not perform any error checking on the input indices or the contents of `ticket`, so it will throw exceptions if `start` or `end` is out of range, or if `ticket` contains non-digit characters. After execution, the function's state is solely the returned sum of the specified segment of `ticket`, with no side effects on the input parameters or the `ticket` string.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
