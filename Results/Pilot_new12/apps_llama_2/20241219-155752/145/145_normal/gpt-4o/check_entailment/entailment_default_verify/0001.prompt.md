You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the fact that the `segment_sum` function is using a variable `ticket` which is not in its scope. The `ticket` variable is passed as an argument to the `func_1` function but not to the `segment_sum` function. 

Another issue is that the `segment_sum` function is not correctly calculating the sum of the first segment. The `segment_sum` function is calling itself recursively, but there is no recursive call in the given code, instead, it's trying to use a variable `ticket` which is not defined.

Also, the program does not handle the case when the ticket can be divided into two or more segments with equal sums, but the segments are not consecutive. The program only checks for consecutive segments.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
6
111111

The program should return 'YES' because the ticket can be divided into six segments, each with a sum of 1. However, the program will return 'NO' because it does not correctly calculate the sum of the first segment.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to modify the program to correctly calculate the sum of the first segment and to handle the case when the ticket can be divided into two or more non-consecutive segments with equal sums.

Here is a modified version of the program that correctly solves the problem:
```python
def is_lucky(n, ticket):
    for segment_sum_value in range(1, sum(map(int, ticket)) + 1):
        segments = []
        current_sum = 0
        current_segment = []
        for digit in ticket:
            current_sum += int(digit)
            current_segment.append(digit)
            if current_sum == segment_sum_value:
                segments.append(current_segment)
                current_sum = 0
                current_segment = []
        if current_sum == 0 and len(segments) > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(is_lucky(n, ticket))
```
This program correctly solves the problem by trying all possible sums of the segments and checking if the ticket can be divided into two or more segments with the given sum. If the ticket can be divided into two or more segments with the given sum, the program returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the digits in a predefined string `ticket` from a specified start index to an end index (inclusive), where both indices are non-negative and the start index is less than or equal to the end index, which in turn is less than the length of the `ticket` string. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns an integer sum. The function assumes that `ticket` is accessible and is a string of digits. The function does not perform any error checking on the input indices or the contents of `ticket`, so it will throw exceptions if `start` or `end` is out of range, or if `ticket` contains non-digit characters. After execution, the function's state is solely the returned sum of the specified segment of `ticket`, with no side effects on the input parameters or the `ticket` string.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
