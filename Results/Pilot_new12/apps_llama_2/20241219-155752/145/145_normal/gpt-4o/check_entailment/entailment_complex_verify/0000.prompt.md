You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not fully implement the required functionality. It seems like the code is incomplete, and there are several issues with it. 

1. The function `segment_sum` is trying to access the variable `ticket` which is not defined within this function. The `ticket` variable should be passed as an argument to this function.

2. The function `func_1` is also trying to access the variable `ticket` without it being passed as an argument. This variable should be passed as an argument to this function as well.

3. The main issue with this code is that it does not check all possible combinations of segment lengths. It only checks for segments of length 1 to `n-1` where `n` is the total length of the ticket. It does not consider the case where the first segment has a different length than the rest of the segments.

Here is an example where this program does not work as expected:
Input:
6
123123

In this case, the program should return "YES" because the ticket can be divided into segments 123 and 123 with equal sums. However, the given program may not return the correct result due to its incomplete implementation. 

A correct implementation should consider all possible combinations of segment lengths, not just the ones of length 1 to `n-1`. 

Here is a basic idea of how a correct implementation could look:

```python
def is_lucky(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(segment_length))
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 1
        for i in range(segment_length, n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(is_lucky(n, ticket))
```

But this solution still has issues as it only checks for the case where the first segment has the same length as the rest of the segments. It does not consider the case where the first segment has a different length than the rest of the segments. 

To solve this problem correctly, we would need a more complex algorithm that considers all possible combinations of segment lengths. 

For example:

```python
def is_lucky(n, ticket):
    def can_divide(start, target_sum):
        if start == n:
            return True
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(start, n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                if can_divide(i + 1, target_sum):
                    return True
        return False

    for i in range(1, n):
        target_sum = sum(int(ticket[j]) for j in range(i))
        if can_divide(i, target_sum):
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(is_lucky(n, ticket))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and ticket is a string of digits of length n.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, and for all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, either the sum of the digits cannot be evenly divided into segments of the same sum or there is only one such segment.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns string 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given string of digits (`ticket`) of length `n` can be divided into segments of the same sum for any segment length from 1 to `n-1`. It returns 'YES' if such a division is possible with more than one segment, and 'NO' otherwise. The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `ticket`, where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1 and `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`. After execution, the function will be in one of two states: it will have returned 'YES' if a valid division into segments of the same sum is found, or 'NO' if no such division is possible for all segment lengths or if the division results in only one segment. The function covers all potential segment lengths and considers the sum of digits for each segment, handling cases where the sum of digits cannot be evenly divided into segments of the same sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len(ticket), where ticket is a string of digits representing the golden ticket.
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the 'ticket' string from index 'start' to 'end' (inclusive), where 'start' and 'end' are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len('ticket'), and 'ticket' is a string of digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the digits in a predefined string `ticket` from a specified start index to an end index (inclusive), where both indices are non-negative and the start index is less than or equal to the end index, which in turn is less than the length of the `ticket` string. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns an integer sum. The function assumes that `ticket` is accessible and is a string of digits. The function does not perform any error checking on the input indices or the contents of `ticket`, so it will throw exceptions if `start` or `end` is out of range, or if `ticket` contains non-digit characters. After execution, the function's state is solely the returned sum of the specified segment of `ticket`, with no side effects on the input parameters or the `ticket` string.
