To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
2. `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`.
3. `segment_length` is 2.
4. `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`.
5. `i` is 1.
6. `current_sum` is not directly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems to be a variable that accumulates the sum of certain digits from the `ticket`. Since it's being incremented, we can infer it was initialized before this step, possibly to the sum of the first digit (index 0) of the `ticket`, but the exact initial value is not provided. However, given the structure of the problem and the fact that `i` starts at 1 and `target_sum` is the sum of digits at indices 0 and 1, we can infer `current_sum` might initially hold the value of the digit at index 0 or is being used in a context where it accumulates sums starting from the second digit (index 1) onwards.

The code provided is:
```python
current_sum += int(ticket[i])
```
Given `i` is 1, this line of code adds the digit at index 1 of the `ticket` to `current_sum`.

- `n` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `ticket` remains a string of digits of length `n`.
- `segment_length` remains 2.
- `target_sum` remains the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`.
- `i` is still 1 (its value hasn't been modified by the given code).
- `current_sum` is now incremented by the value of the digit at index 1 of the `ticket`.

Since `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1, and assuming `current_sum` initially held the value of the digit at index 0 (or was 0 and is accumulating from index 1), after this operation, `current_sum` would be equal to `target_sum` if it started with the value of the digit at index 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`, `i` is 1, and `current_sum` is equal to `target_sum` assuming it was initialized with the digit at index 0 or is otherwise the sum of the digits up to index `i` (1) of the `ticket`.**
