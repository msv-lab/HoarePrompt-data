The code statement `current_sum += int(ticket[i])` updates the value of `current_sum` by adding the integer value of the digit at index `i` in the `ticket` string.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2
- `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`
- `segment_length` is 1
- `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`
- `i` is 2

And considering that `current_sum` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we must infer its initial value based on the context or assume it's defined elsewhere. However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's consider that `current_sum` could be initialized with a value, possibly related to `target_sum` given the context, but since it's not explicitly stated, we will treat it as it is directly affected by the operation.

Given `i` is 2, `current_sum` will be increased by the value of the digit at index 2 in `ticket`. 

The states of `n`, `ticket`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 2, and `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of `ticket[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 2, and `current_sum` is `current_sum` + `int(ticket[2])`**
