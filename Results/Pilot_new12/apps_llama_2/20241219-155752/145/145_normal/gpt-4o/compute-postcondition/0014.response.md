Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 1, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is increased by 1; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.***
