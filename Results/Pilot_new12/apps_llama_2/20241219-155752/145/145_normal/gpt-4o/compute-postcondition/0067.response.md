Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `i` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the second, third, and fourth digits of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `current_sum` being either the third digit of `ticket` or the sum of the second, third, and fourth digits of `ticket` plus twice the third digit of `ticket`.***
