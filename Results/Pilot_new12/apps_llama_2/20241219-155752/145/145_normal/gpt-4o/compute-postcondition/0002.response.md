Functionality: **The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the digits in a predefined string `ticket` from a specified start index to an end index (inclusive), where both indices are non-negative and the start index is less than or equal to the end index, which in turn is less than the length of the `ticket` string. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, and returns an integer sum. The function assumes that `ticket` is accessible and is a string of digits. The function does not perform any error checking on the input indices or the contents of `ticket`, so it will throw exceptions if `start` or `end` is out of range, or if `ticket` contains non-digit characters. After execution, the function's state is solely the returned sum of the specified segment of `ticket`, with no side effects on the input parameters or the `ticket` string.**
