Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`, `i` is `n-1`, `current_sum` is the remainder of the sum of the digits of `ticket` divided by `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of segments in `ticket` where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. Either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
