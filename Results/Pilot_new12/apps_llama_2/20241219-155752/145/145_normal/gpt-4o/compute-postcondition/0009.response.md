Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state remains as it was before the if condition, since there's no specified action for the else part.***
