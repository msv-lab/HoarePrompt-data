Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `i` is `n-1`, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of the original `ticket`, `current_sum` is either 0 or the sum of the last segment of digits in `ticket` that didn't match `target_sum`, and `segment_count` is the total number of segments in `ticket` where the sum of the digits equals `target_sum`. Either `current_sum` is not 0, or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
