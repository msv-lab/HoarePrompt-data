The code resets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial value of `current_sum` was `current_sum` + `int(ticket[2])`, but this is overwritten by the new value 0.
The values of `n`, `ticket`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 2, and `current_sum` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 2, and `current_sum` is 0**
