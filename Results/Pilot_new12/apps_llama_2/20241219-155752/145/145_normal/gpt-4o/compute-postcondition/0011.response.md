The variable `current_sum` is not defined in the initial state, but `target_sum` is defined as the digit at index 0 of `ticket`. However, based on the given code, it seems that `current_sum` should be equal to `target_sum` initially. 

The value of `current_sum` becomes `current_sum` plus the digit at index `i` of `ticket`. Since `current_sum` is initially equal to the digit at index 0 of `ticket` and `i` is 1, `current_sum` becomes the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of `ticket`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 1, `current_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of `ticket`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `i` is 1, `current_sum` is `target_sum` + `int(ticket[1])`**
