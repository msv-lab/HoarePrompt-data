The value of `current_sum` is reset to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of complete segments that sum to the original `target_sum`, and `i` is `n-1`, with either `segment_count` less than or equal to 1.
