Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`, `i` is 1, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is 1, otherwise the state of the variables remains as in the precondition except for the fact that `current_sum` equals `target_sum` is not true**
