`current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of the digit at index `i` in `ticket`. The value of `i` is 1, so the digit at index `i` is the second digit of `ticket`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `i` is 1, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket` plus the second digit of `ticket`, which can also be expressed as `current_sum` is `target_sum` plus the second digit of `ticket` minus the first digit of `ticket` because the first digit was already included in `target_sum`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `i` is 1, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket` plus the second digit of `ticket`.**
