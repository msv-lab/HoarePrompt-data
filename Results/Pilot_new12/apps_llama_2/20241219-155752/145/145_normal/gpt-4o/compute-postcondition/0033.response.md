Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `current_sum` not equal to `target_sum`.***
