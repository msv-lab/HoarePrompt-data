Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the digit at index 0 of the original `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the remaining digits after the last complete segment that sums to `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of complete segments that sum to `target_sum`, and `i` is `n-1`. The current value of `current_sum` is 0 and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1.**
