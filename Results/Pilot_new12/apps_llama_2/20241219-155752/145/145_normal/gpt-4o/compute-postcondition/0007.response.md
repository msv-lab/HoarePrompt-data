The variable `current_sum` is reset to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is an integer equal to the digit at index 0 of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 0.
