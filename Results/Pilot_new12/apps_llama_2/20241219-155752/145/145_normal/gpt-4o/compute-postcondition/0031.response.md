The code sets `current_sum` to 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, which is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the digits at indices 0 and 1 of the `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0, and `i` is 0**
