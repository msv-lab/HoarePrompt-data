Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `i` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `current_sum` being the integer value of the first digit of `ticket` and `segment_count` being 0.**
