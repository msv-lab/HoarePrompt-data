Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears from the input.
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the minimum number of lemons that can be used to make the compote. This is done by taking the minimum of the number of lemons, the number of apples divided by 2 (since the ratio of apples to lemons is 2:1), and the number of pears divided by 4 (since the ratio of pears to lemons is 4:1).
3. The program then prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is the number of lemons (`min_lemon`) plus twice the number of lemons (`min_lemon * 2`) for the apples, plus four times the number of lemons (`min_lemon * 4`) for the pears.

The key insight here is that the number of lemons is the limiting factor, and `min_lemon` is the maximum number of lemons that can be used given the available apples and pears. By using `min_lemon` to calculate the number of apples and pears, the program ensures that the ratio of lemons, apples, and pears is always 1:2:4, as required by the problem statement.

For example, if the input is `2`, `5`, and `7`, the program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(2, 5//2, 7//4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`. It then prints `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is the correct answer.

Similarly, if the input is `4`, `7`, and `13`, the program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(4, 7//2, 13//4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`. It then prints `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, which is the correct answer.

If the input is `2`, `3`, and `2`, the program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(2, 3//2, 2//4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`, because there are not enough pears to make the compote. In this case, the program prints `0`, which is the correct answer.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
