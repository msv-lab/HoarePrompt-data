Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote according to the given ratio. 

Here's an explanation of why the code works:

- The function `func` takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input and stores them in the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.

- The line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote, considering the given ratio. It finds the smallest value among the number of lemons available (`a`), half of the number of apples available (`b // 2`), and a quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`). This ensures that the number of apples and pears is sufficient to maintain the 1:2:4 ratio.

- The line `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)` calculates the total number of fruits that can be used and prints the result. This is done by adding the number of lemons (`min_lemon`), twice the number of lemons (to account for the apples), and four times the number of lemons (to account for the pears).

- The code handles all possible cases correctly. If there are not enough apples or pears to maintain the ratio, the `min` function ensures that the number of lemons is limited accordingly. If there are no lemons, the function correctly prints 0, as the compote cannot be made without lemons.

- The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the function. For instance, in the first example, the function correctly calculates that 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears can be used, resulting in a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 fruits. Similarly, the function handles the other examples correctly.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
