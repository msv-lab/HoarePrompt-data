Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and prints the total number of fruits that can be used to make a compote. The formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used, given the constraints that for each lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are needed. The function then prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is the sum of the lemons, apples, and pears.

The code assumes that the input values are valid, i.e., they are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. The provided examples demonstrate that the code works correctly for different input cases.

For example, when the input is 2, 5, and 7, the code correctly outputs 7, which corresponds to using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. Similarly, when the input is 4, 7, and 13, the code outputs 21, which corresponds to using 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.

In the case where the input is 2, 3, and 2, the code correctly outputs 0, indicating that there are not enough pears to make a compote.

Since the code correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the problem description, the Correctness is **True**.
