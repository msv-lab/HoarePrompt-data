Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook a compote according to the given ratio. 

Here is the explanation of why the code is correct:

- The program correctly reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input from the user.
- The `min_lemon` variable is calculated as the minimum of the number of lemons available, the number of apples divided by 2 (since the ratio of apples to lemons is 2:1), and the number of pears divided by 4 (since the ratio of pears to lemons is 4:1). This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of lemons, and that there are enough apples and pears to maintain the required ratio.
- The program then prints the total number of fruits used, which is the sum of the number of lemons, twice the number of lemons (for apples), and four times the number of lemons (for pears).

The program correctly handles all potential cases:

- If there are enough apples and pears to use all available lemons, the program will use all the lemons.
- If there are not enough apples or pears to use all available lemons, the program will use the maximum number of lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio.
- If there are not enough apples or pears to use any lemons, the program will print 0, which is the correct result.

The program also correctly handles the examples provided:

- For the input 2, 5, 7, the program prints 7, which is the correct result (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears).
- For the input 4, 7, 13, the program prints 21, which is the correct result (3 lemons + 6 apples + 12 pears).
- For the input 2, 3, 2, the program prints 0, which is the correct result (there are not enough pears to use any lemons).

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and examples, it is correct.
