Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make a compote. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits, taking into account the required ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The program then prints the total number of fruits that can be used to make a compote, which is the minimum number of lemons plus the corresponding number of apples and pears.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the input values are within the specified range of 1 to 1000 and are positive integers. The code does not require any error handling for invalid inputs, as it is assumed that the user will always provide valid input.

The code also produces the correct output for the provided examples. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly calculates that 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears can be used to make a compote, resulting in a total of 7 fruits. Similarly, in the second example, the program correctly calculates that 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears can be used to make a compote, resulting in a total of 21 fruits. In the third example, the program correctly determines that not enough fruits are available to make a compote, resulting in an output of 0.

Overall, the code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make a compote, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
