Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.
2. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits using the formula `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that there are enough apples and pears to match the lemons in the ratio 1:2:4.
3. It then prints the total number of fruits that can be used to make a compote, assuming 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears are needed for each juice, using the formula `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are enough apples and pears to match the lemons, it calculates the maximum number of compotes that can be made.
* If there are not enough apples or pears to match the lemons, it reduces the number of lemons used to the minimum possible, ensuring that the remaining apples and pears are sufficient.
* If there are not enough fruits of any type to make a compote, it prints 0.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.
