To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code is printing the value of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. 

Given that `min_lemon` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` which is `min_lemon * 7`.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and `min_lemon` is determined based on these inputs. The code does not modify `a`, `b`, `c`, or `min_lemon`; it only prints a value calculated from `min_lemon`.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the printed value is `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the program prints `min_lemon * 7`.**
