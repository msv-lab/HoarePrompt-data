To determine the output state, we first need to understand the effect of the given code on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The code introduces a new variable `min_lemon` and assigns it the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer

The operation `b // 2` performs integer division of `b` by 2, effectively halving `b` and rounding down to the nearest whole number because `//` is used for floor division in Python. Similarly, `c // 4` quarters `c` and rounds down.

The `min()` function then selects the smallest among `a`, the result of `b // 2`, and the result of `c // 4`, and assigns this minimum value to `min_lemon`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `min_lemon` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
