Correctness: **True**

The code correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It first calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, taking into account the required ratio of 1 lemon to 2 apples to 4 pears, and then calculates the total number of fruits used in this combination.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the input values are not sufficient to make the combination. For example, in the case where there are 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the code correctly outputs 0 because there are not enough pears to make the combination.

The code also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description. In the first example, where there are 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the code correctly outputs 7. In the second example, where there are 4 lemons, 7 apples, and 13 pears, the code correctly outputs 21. In the third example, where there are 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the code correctly outputs 0.

The code assumes that the input values are valid, which is stated in the problem description. Therefore, the code does not need to handle cases where the input values are not positive integers or where the number of apples or pears is negative or zero.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
