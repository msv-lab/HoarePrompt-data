You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct according to the problem description. It determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. The program uses the formula `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to calculate the maximum number of lemons that can be used, ensuring that there are enough apples and pears to meet the 1:2:4 ratio.

Here's why the program is correct:

1.  **Calculating max_lemons**: The `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` expression calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of the available lemons (`a`), the available apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), and the available pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`). This ensures that there are enough apples and pears to meet the required ratio.
2.  **Calculating total_fruits**: The `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` expression calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote. This expression correctly represents the total number of lemons, apples, and pears used based on the calculated `max_lemons`.
3.  **Handling edge cases**: The program handles edge cases where there are not enough fruits to cook the compote. In such cases, `max_lemons` will be 0, resulting in a `total_fruits` value of 0, which is the correct output.

Since the program correctly implements the required logic and handles edge cases, it is correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three positive integers as input from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, and calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a combination of fruits where each lemon requires half an apple and a quarter of a pear. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in this combination and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input values are not positive integers or where the number of apples or pears is insufficient to make the combination, it simply assumes that the inputs will be valid. After execution, the program will have printed the total number of fruits used in the combination to the console, and the input variables will have been used and discarded.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
