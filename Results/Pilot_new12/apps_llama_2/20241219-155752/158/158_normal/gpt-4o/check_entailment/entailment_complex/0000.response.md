Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes three positive integers as input, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`), which matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Lemons**: The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote by finding the minimum of `a` (the number of lemons available), `b // 2` (the number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples), and `c // 4` (the number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears). This calculation ensures that the ratio of 1 lemon to 2 apples to 4 pears is maintained.

3. **Calculation of Total Fruits**: Once the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) is determined, the program calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1 (for lemons), `max_lemons` by 2 (for apples), and `max_lemons` by 4 (for pears), and then summing these quantities. This step correctly applies the ratio specified in the problem description to calculate the total number of fruits.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits used in the compote, which is the desired output according to the problem description.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the available fruits while maintaining the required ratio, and outputs the total number of fruits used, it accurately implements the solution to the problem described. Therefore, it is correct for all potential valid input cases.
