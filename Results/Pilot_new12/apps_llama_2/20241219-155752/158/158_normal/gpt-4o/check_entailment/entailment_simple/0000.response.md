Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

* The program reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.
* It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This is because for each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.
* It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1 (for the lemons themselves), 2 (for the apples), and 4 (for the pears), and summing these values.
* Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are not enough apples or pears to match the number of lemons, the `min` function ensures that the maximum number of lemons is limited by the available apples or pears.
* If there are not enough fruits to make any compote, the program prints 0, which is the correct answer in this case.

For example, if the input is `2`, `5`, and `7`, the program calculates `max_lemons` as `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`, and then calculates `total_fruits` as `1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 7`, which is the correct answer.

Similarly, if the input is `4`, `7`, and `13`, the program calculates `max_lemons` as `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`, and then calculates `total_fruits` as `3 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 21`, which is the correct answer.

Finally, if the input is `2`, `3`, and `2`, the program calculates `max_lemons` as `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`, and then calculates `total_fruits` as `0 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 = 0`, which is the correct answer in this case.
