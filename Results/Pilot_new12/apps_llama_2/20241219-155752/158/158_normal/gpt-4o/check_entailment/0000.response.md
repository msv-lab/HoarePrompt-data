Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It determines the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote in the ratio 1:2:4.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It first reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) as input.
2. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the available number of lemons, and that the corresponding number of apples and pears is also available.
3. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits that can be used (`total_fruits`) by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1 (lemon), 2 (apples), and 4 (pears), and prints the result.

The code handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are not enough apples or pears to match the number of lemons, `max_lemons` will be limited by `b // 2` or `c // 4`, ensuring that the ratio is maintained.
* If there are not enough lemons, `max_lemons` will be limited by `a`, and the corresponding number of apples and pears will be calculated based on the available lemons.
* If none of the fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), the program will print 0, as expected.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
