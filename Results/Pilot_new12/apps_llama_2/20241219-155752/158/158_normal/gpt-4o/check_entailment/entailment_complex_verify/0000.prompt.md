You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It determines the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote in the ratio 1:2:4.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It first reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) as input.
2. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the available number of lemons, and that the corresponding number of apples and pears is also available.
3. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits that can be used (`total_fruits`) by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1 (lemon), 2 (apples), and 4 (pears), and prints the result.

The code handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are not enough apples or pears to match the number of lemons, `max_lemons` will be limited by `b // 2` or `c // 4`, ensuring that the ratio is maintained.
* If there are not enough lemons, `max_lemons` will be limited by `a`, and the corresponding number of apples and pears will be calculated based on the available lemons.
* If none of the fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), the program will print 0, as expected.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that it will receive and operate on three positive integers: a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three positive integers as input from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, and calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a combination of fruits where each lemon requires half an apple and a quarter of a pear. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in this combination and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input values are not positive integers or where the number of apples or pears is insufficient to make the combination, it simply assumes that the inputs will be valid. After execution, the program will have printed the total number of fruits used in the combination to the console, and the input variables will have been used and discarded.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
