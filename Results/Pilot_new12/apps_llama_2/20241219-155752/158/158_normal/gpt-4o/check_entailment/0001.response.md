Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct according to the problem description. It determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. The program uses the formula `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to calculate the maximum number of lemons that can be used, ensuring that there are enough apples and pears to meet the 1:2:4 ratio.

Here's why the program is correct:

1.  **Calculating max_lemons**: The `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` expression calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of the available lemons (`a`), the available apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), and the available pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`). This ensures that there are enough apples and pears to meet the required ratio.
2.  **Calculating total_fruits**: The `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` expression calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote. This expression correctly represents the total number of lemons, apples, and pears used based on the calculated `max_lemons`.
3.  **Handling edge cases**: The program handles edge cases where there are not enough fruits to cook the compote. In such cases, `max_lemons` will be 0, resulting in a `total_fruits` value of 0, which is the correct output.

Since the program correctly implements the required logic and handles edge cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
