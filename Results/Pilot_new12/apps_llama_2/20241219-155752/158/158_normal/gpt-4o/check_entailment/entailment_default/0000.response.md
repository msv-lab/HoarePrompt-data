Correctness: **True**.

The provided code follows the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. The key to this problem is finding the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is then used to determine the number of apples and pears. The code calculates this maximum number of lemons by taking the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears.

The formula `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of lemons, apples, or pears. Then, `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` correctly calculates the total number of fruits used based on the ratio of 1:2:4.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that it takes the input values, calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make the combination, and prints the total number of fruits used in this combination.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code:

- In the first example, the input is `a = 2`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`. The maximum number of lemons that can be used is 1, which corresponds to 2 apples and 4 pears. The total number of fruits is `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, as expected.
- In the second example, the input is `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 13`. The maximum number of lemons that can be used is 3, which corresponds to 6 apples and 12 pears. The total number of fruits is `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, as expected.
- In the third example, the input is `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`. The maximum number of lemons that can be used is 0 because there are not enough pears. The total number of fruits is `0`, as expected.

Given that the code handles the examples correctly and follows the problem description for every potential case, the code is correct.
