The code `c = int(input())` assigns the value of an input integer to `c`. The value of `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code. 

The initial state of `a` is that it is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and the initial state of `b` is that it is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). 

The value of `c` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and `c` is an input integer**
