To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `a` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and `c` is an input integer.

The code is: `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

This line of code calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b` (integer division, so any fractional part is discarded), and one-fourth of `c` (again, integer division), and assigns this minimum value to `max_lemons`.

Therefore, the value of `max_lemons` will be the smallest of the three calculated values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

Given that `a` is between 1 and 1000, `b` is between 1 and 1000 (making `b // 2` between 0 and 500), and `c` can be any input integer (making `c // 4` potentially any integer value), the range of `max_lemons` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since `a` and `b // 2` have defined maximums (1000 and 500, respectively), and considering the division by 4 for `c`, `max_lemons` will be at most the minimum of these calculated values.

The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this code. Only a new variable, `max_lemons`, is introduced, which holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `c` is an input integer, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
