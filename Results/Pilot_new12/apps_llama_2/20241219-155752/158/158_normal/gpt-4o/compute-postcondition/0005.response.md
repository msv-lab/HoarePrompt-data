The print statement is executed, which prints the value of `total_fruits` to the console. The value of `total_fruits` is 7 times the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since the minimum of these values is stored in `max_lemons`, `total_fruits` can be expressed as 7 times `max_lemons`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and no new variables are introduced. The value of `total_fruits` has been printed but not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is 7 times the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the value of `total_fruits` has been returned and printed at the output.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is 7 times the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the value of `total_fruits` has been returned and printed at the output.**
