According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 31. Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, for the loop to execute, `n-1` must be less than 31, which means `n` must be less than or equal to 30. Given that `n` is already between 1 and 30 (inclusive), the condition is already satisfied. However, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 as per the loop definition, not from `n-1`. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to start from 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` and the rest are 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 1**
