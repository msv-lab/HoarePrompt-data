The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the costs of bottles of different types. After executing the function body, the function returns the minimum achievable cost considering the accumulated minimum cost based on `L` and the dynamic programming (dp) list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the number of bottles `n`, the limit `L`, and the costs of bottles, and return the minimum achievable cost.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of bottles `n`, the limit `L`, and the costs of bottles, and returns the minimum achievable cost.**
