To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the for loop statement and the conditions that need to be met for the loop to continue.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, 31):`, which means `i` will take on values from 1 to 30.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Since the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 31, the other variables do not affect the loop's continuation directly. However, we should note that `n` is between 1 and 30 (inclusive), which could be relevant in how `costs`, `dp`, and `c` are used within the loop body (though the loop body is not provided).

Given this, the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time are primarily related to `i`, which must increase by 1. The conditions on `n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, `dp`, and `c` are not directly impacted by the loop statement itself but are part of the overall program state.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` except `dp[1]` which is `costs[0]`, and the rest are 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 2**
