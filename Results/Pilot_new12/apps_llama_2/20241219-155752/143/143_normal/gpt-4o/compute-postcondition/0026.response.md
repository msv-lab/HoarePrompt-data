The value of `current_cost` is increased by `dp[i]`, where `i` is 29. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the new value of `current_cost` is its previous value plus `dp[29]`. 

If `L` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 30, then the previous value of `current_cost` is `dp[29]`, so the new value of `current_cost` is `dp[29] + dp[29] = 2 * dp[29]`. 
Otherwise, the previous value of `current_cost` is 0, so the new value of `current_cost` is `0 + dp[29] = dp[29]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 29, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, if `L` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 30, then `current_cost` is `2 * dp[29]`, otherwise `current_cost` is `dp[29]`, and `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + dp[29]`.**
