The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Since `i` is 2, `dp[2]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[1] * 2`. 

`dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The first `n` elements of `c` are the corresponding elements from `costs`, and the remaining are `max_cost`. The first `n` elements of `dp` are the corresponding elements from `costs` except `dp[1]` which is `costs[0]`, and the rest are `max_cost`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), 
`L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
`costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
`max_cost` is 10^18, 
`c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, 
`dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, and the rest of the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` (for indices greater than 2) and the remaining are `max_cost`, 
`i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, and the rest of the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` (for indices greater than 2) and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 2**
