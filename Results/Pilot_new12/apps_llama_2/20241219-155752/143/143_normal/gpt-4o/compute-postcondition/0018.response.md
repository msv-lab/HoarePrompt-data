The code snippet is `current_cost = 0`. This line assigns the value `0` to the variable `current_cost`. 

Since `current_cost` was not mentioned in the initial state, we only need to add this new information to the initial state.

The initial state was: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `max_cost` is 10^18
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`
- `i` is 30
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element
- `answer` is 10^18

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 30, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, `answer` is 10^18, `current_cost` is 0**
