The code `current_cost += dp[i]` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 28, so `dp[i]` is `dp[28]`. 

The initial value of `current_cost` is `dp[28]`. After the update, `current_cost` becomes `dp[28] + dp[28]`, which is equivalent to `2 * dp[28]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) or 0 if `L` was initially greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 29 and then reduced, `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 28, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, `current_cost` is `2 * dp[28]`, `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[28] + dp[28]` if `L` is greater than 0, or the minimum of its previous value and `dp[28]` if `L` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) or 0 if `L` was initially greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 29 and then reduced, `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 28, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, `current_cost` is `2 * dp[28]`, `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[28] + dp[28]` if `L` is greater than 0, or the minimum of its previous value and `dp[28]` if `L` is 0**
