To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive),
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `max_cost` is 10^18,
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`,
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, and the rest of the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` (for indices greater than 2) and the remaining are `max_cost`,
- `i` is 3,

The code updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `dp[3]` will be updated to the minimum of its current value (`costs[2]`) and `dp[2] * 2`. 

Since `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, let's denote `dp[2]` as `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2)`. 

Thus, `dp[3]` becomes `min(costs[2], min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2) * 2)`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, `c`, and `i`) are not affected by this update.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive),
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive),
- `max_cost` is 10^18,
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`,
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, `dp[3]` is the minimum of `costs[2]` and `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2) * 2`, and the rest of the elements are as initially defined,
- `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, `dp[3]` is the minimum of `costs[2]` and `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2) * 2`, and the rest of the elements are as initially defined, `i` is 3**
