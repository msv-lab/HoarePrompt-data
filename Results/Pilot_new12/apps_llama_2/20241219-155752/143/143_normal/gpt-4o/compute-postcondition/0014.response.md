According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 31, which is the upper limit of the loop.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] * 2`, and the rest of the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` (for indices greater than 2) and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 3**
