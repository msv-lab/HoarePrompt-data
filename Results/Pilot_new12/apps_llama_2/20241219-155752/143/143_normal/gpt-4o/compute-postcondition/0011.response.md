The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` updates the value of `dp[i]` by taking the minimum between its current value and twice the value of `dp[i - 1]`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), 
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
- `max_cost` is 10^18, 
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` and the rest are 10^18, 
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, 
- `i` is 1,

The new value of `dp[1]` will be the minimum between `dp[1]` (which is `costs[0]`) and `dp[0] * 2` (which is `costs[0] * 2`).

Since `dp[0]` is `costs[0]`, the minimum will be `costs[0]` because `costs[0]` is less than or equal to `costs[0] * 2` for any positive value of `costs[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), 
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
- `max_cost` is 10^18, 
- `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` except `dp[1]` which is `costs[0]`, and the rest are 10^18, 
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, 
- `i` is 1, 
- `dp[1]` is equal to `costs[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the corresponding elements from `costs` except `dp[1]` which is `costs[0]`, and the rest are 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 1**
