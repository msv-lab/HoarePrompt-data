The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum between its current value and `c[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the update specifically affects `dp[1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp[1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[1]`, `c` is a list of 31 integers, `i` is 1**
