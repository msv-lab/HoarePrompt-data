The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. The value of `i` is 30, so `dp[i]` is `dp[30]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), 
`L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and the current value of `L` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 30, 
`costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), 
`max_cost` is 10^18, 
`c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, 
`i` is 30, 
`dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, 
`answer` is 10^18, 
`current_cost` is `dp[30]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and the current value of `L` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 30, `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 30, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, `answer` is 10^18, `current_cost` is `dp[30]`.**
