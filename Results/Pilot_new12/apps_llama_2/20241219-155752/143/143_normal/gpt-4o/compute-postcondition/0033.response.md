Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) or 0 if `L` was initially greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 29 and then reduced, `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 28, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, if `L` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `i`, then `L` is `L - 2^28`, `current_cost` is `2 * dp[28]`, otherwise `current_cost` remains `dp[28]`, and `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[28] + dp[28]` if `L` is greater than 0, or the minimum of its previous value and `dp[28]` if `L` is 0***
