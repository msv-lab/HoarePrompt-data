According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, `c` is a list of 31 integers, `i` is 1**
