According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we also need to adjust the state to include the value of `i`, which is the loop counter. At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers, where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` integers are equal to `max_cost`, `i` is 0**
