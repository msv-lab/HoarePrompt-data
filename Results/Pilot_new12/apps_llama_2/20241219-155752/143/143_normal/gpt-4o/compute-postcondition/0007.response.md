According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp[1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `c[1]`, `c` is a list of 31 integers, `i` is 2**
