`answer` is assigned the value `max_cost`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 30, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, `answer` is 10^18.
