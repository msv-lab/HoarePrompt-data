The code creates a new list `dp` of size 31, filled with the value `max_cost`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `max_cost` is 10^18. 

The initial state of `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). 

The size of `dp` is 31, which is greater than `n`, and `dp` is filled with `max_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, and `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to 10^18**
