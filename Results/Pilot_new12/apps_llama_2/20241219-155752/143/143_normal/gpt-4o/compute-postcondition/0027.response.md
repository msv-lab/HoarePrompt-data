The value of `L` is decreased by 2 raised to the power of `i`, which is 2^29. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) minus 2^29, `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 29, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, if `L` - 2^29 is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of 30, then `current_cost` is `2 * dp[29]`, otherwise `current_cost` is `dp[29]`, and `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + dp[29]`. However, `L` - 2^29 is always less than 2^30 because `L` is initially between 1 and 10^9 and 2^30 is greater than 10^9. Therefore, `current_cost` will always be `dp[29]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is `L` - 2^29, `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining are `max_cost`, `i` is 29, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element, `current_cost` is `dp[29]`, and `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[29] + dp[29]`.**
