The code snippet `c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))` creates a new list `c` by concatenating the list `costs` with a list of `max_cost` repeated `31 - len(costs)` times. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive) and `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `len(costs)` is equal to `n`. 

Therefore, the list `c` will have `n` integers from `costs` and `31 - n` values of `max_cost`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all equal to 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers, where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` integers are equal to `max_cost`.**
