The value of `dp[i]` becomes the minimum of its current value (`10^18`) and `c[i]`. Since `c[0]` is the first element of `costs`, which is between 1 and `10^9`, the value of `dp[0]` becomes `c[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[0]` is equal to `c[0]` (which is `costs[0]`) and the rest are equal to 10^18, `c` is a list of 31 integers, where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` integers are equal to `max_cost`, `i` is 0**
