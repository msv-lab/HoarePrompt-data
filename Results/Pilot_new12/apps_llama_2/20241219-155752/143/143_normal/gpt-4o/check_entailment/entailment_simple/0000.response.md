Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. 

The problem asks for the smallest number of roubles that need to be paid in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade. The program is using a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost, but it has a flaw in its logic.

The issue is in the line where it updates the `answer` variable. The program is adding the cost of the current bottle to `current_cost` even if `L` is greater than or equal to the volume of the current bottle. This can lead to an incorrect result because the program is not considering all possible combinations of bottles that could be purchased to reach the required volume.

For example, if `L` is 12 and the costs of the bottles are [20, 30, 70, 90], the program should return 150 because it's possible to buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. However, the program might not consider this combination and could return a different answer.

Another issue is that the program is not correctly calculating the minimum cost. It's using the formula `min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])` to update the `answer` variable, but this formula is not correct. The `(L > 0) * dp[i]` part is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the program, it needs to be rewritten to correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying at least L liters of lemonade. This can be done using a dynamic programming approach that considers all possible combinations of bottles and finds the one that results in the minimum cost.

Here is an example of how the program could be rewritten:
```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            volume = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1
            if i >= volume:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - volume] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]
```
This rewritten program uses a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost of buying at least L liters of lemonade. It creates a list `dp` of size L + 1, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost of buying i liters of lemonade. It then iterates over each possible volume of lemonade and updates the `dp` list accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum cost of buying at least L liters of lemonade, which is stored in `dp[L]`.
