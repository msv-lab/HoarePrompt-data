Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code appears to be almost correct, but there is an issue in the way it calculates the minimum cost. The code initializes `dp` with `max_cost` and then updates it with the minimum cost of purchasing a bottle of a specific type or two bottles of the next lower type. However, this approach does not consider the possibility of purchasing multiple bottles of the same type.

The issue arises when the code tries to calculate the minimum cost for purchasing a certain quantity of lemonade. It starts from the largest bottle size and tries to fill the remaining quantity with smaller bottles. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost, as it does not consider the possibility of purchasing multiple bottles of the same type.

For example, if the costs are `[10, 20, 30, 40]` and the quantity is `12`, the code will calculate the minimum cost as `30 + 20 + 10 = 60`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost would be `10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 120`, but a better solution would be to buy `4` bottles of `3` liters for `4 * 10 = 40` or `8` bottles of `1` liters for `8 * 10 = 80`. The optimal solution in this case would be `1 * 8 liters + 4 * 1 liters = 90 + 4 * 10 = 130` is not optimal, but `4 * 3 liters = 4 * 10 = 40`.

A correct approach would be to use a greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest bottle size that does not exceed the remaining quantity, and repeats this process until the quantity is filled. However, this approach needs to consider the cost of each bottle size and choose the one that minimizes the total cost. 

The current implementation of the code does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect. 

In order to fix this, we need to reconsider the approach used in the code and make sure it handles all possible cases correctly. 

Here is a correct python solution:
```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        total_cost = 0
        total_volume = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i)) > 0:
                total_cost += costs[i]
                total_volume += (1 << (i + 1)) - 1
        if total_volume >= L:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)
    return min_cost
```
