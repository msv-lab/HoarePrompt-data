Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to buy the lemonade. The program tries to buy the largest possible volume of lemonade first and then fills the remaining volume with smaller bottles. However, this approach may not always lead to the minimum cost.

A counterexample is when the input is `n = 2, L = 3` and the costs are `c_1 = 10, c_2 = 100`. The program will buy one 3-liter bottle for 100 roubles, which exceeds the required volume of 3 liters. However, the optimal solution is to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, which totals 30 roubles.

The correct approach would be to use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to `L`. The minimum cost for a volume `v` can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of bottles that sum up to `v` and choosing the one with the minimum cost.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        volume = (1 << i) - 1
        cost = costs[i - 1]
        for j in range(volume, L + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - volume] + cost)
    return dp[L]
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming to build up the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to `L`. For each bottle size `i`, it updates the minimum cost for each volume `j` that is greater than or equal to the volume of the bottle. The minimum cost for `j` is either the current minimum cost or the minimum cost for `j - volume` plus the cost of the bottle.
