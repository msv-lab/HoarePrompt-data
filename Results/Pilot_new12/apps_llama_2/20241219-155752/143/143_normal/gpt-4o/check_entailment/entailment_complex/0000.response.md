Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description states that the goal is to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade with the least cost, given the costs of bottles of different volumes. The volumes of the bottles are `2^i - 1` liters, where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.

However, in the provided program, the code seems to be using powers of 2 (`1 << i`) to calculate the volume of the bottles, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should be using `2^i - 1` to calculate the volume of the bottles.

Here's an example of how the program can be corrected:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [[max_cost for _ in range(L + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(L + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            volume = (1 << i) - 1
            if j >= volume:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - volume] + costs[i - 1])
    
    answer = max_cost
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(L, L + 1):
            if dp[i][j] < answer:
                answer = dp[i][j]
    
    return answer
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade with the given costs of bottles of different volumes. It correctly calculates the volumes of the bottles as `2^i - 1` and uses these volumes to calculate the minimum cost.
