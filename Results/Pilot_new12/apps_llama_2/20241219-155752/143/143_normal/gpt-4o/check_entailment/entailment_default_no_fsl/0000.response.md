Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade. 

The problem in the code lies in the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)`. This line is trying to consider the option of buying two bottles of the next lower type, but it's not considering the actual cost of the current type, and it's also not considering the volumes of the bottles.

A correct approach to this problem would be to try all possible combinations of bottles that sum up to at least L liters, and then choose the combination with the minimum cost.

For example, the input `4 12`, `20 30 70 90` should return `150` which is correct, but for the input `4 3`, `10 100 1000 10000`, the program returns `10` which is also correct, however, the problem is not handled correctly for all cases, especially for cases where the cost of a larger bottle is smaller than the cost of two smaller bottles.

To correctly solve this problem, we should use a more dynamic approach, where we try all possible combinations of bottles that sum up to at least L liters.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def minCost(n, L, costs):
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        total_liters = 0
        total_cost = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask & (1 << i)):
                total_liters += 2 ** (i + 1) - 1
                total_cost += costs[i]
        if total_liters >= L:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)
    return min_cost

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(minCost(n, L, costs))
```
This program will try all possible combinations of bottles and choose the combination with the minimum cost that sums up to at least L liters. 

However, the above solution will not be efficient for large inputs because it has a time complexity of O(2^n). A more efficient solution would be to use dynamic programming to solve this problem, but the given code is not doing that correctly. 

In the dynamic programming approach, we can use a dp array where dp[i] will store the minimum cost to buy i liters of lemonade. We can fill up this dp array by trying all possible combinations of bottles.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def minCost(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            liters = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1
            if i >= liters:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - liters] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(minCost(n, L, costs))
```
This program will use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy L liters of lemonade. It will try all possible combinations of bottles and choose the combination with the minimum cost.

I apologize for the long explanation, but the given code was not correct and I had to explain the correct approach to solve this problem.
