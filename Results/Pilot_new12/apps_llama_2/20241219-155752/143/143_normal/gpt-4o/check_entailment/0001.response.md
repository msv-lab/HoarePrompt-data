Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect approach to minimize the cost. The program tries to minimize the cost by first filling the largest bottles and then the smallest ones, but this approach is not optimal in all cases.

For example, consider the case where n = 2, L = 3, and costs = [10, 20]. The program will choose to buy one 3-liter bottle for 20 roubles, but it would be cheaper to buy three 1-liter bottles for 30 roubles is not cheaper, however if we have costs = [10, 8] the algorithm will still choose to buy one 3-liter bottle, for 10 roubles, however the optimal solution is to buy 3 1-liter bottles, for 8 roubles,  but actually it is cheaper to use one 3-liter bottle and pay 10 roubles, so this example does not work, but if we have costs = [10, 3] the algorithm will choose one 3-liter bottle, but the optimal solution is to buy 3 bottles of 1 liter each, which would cost 9 roubles, so this case shows that the algorithm does not work correctly for all inputs.

A correct approach would be to use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to L, and then choose the minimum cost for volume L.

Here is a simple example, in python:
```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            volume = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1
            if i >= volume:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - volume] + costs[j])
    return dp[L]
```
This program uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to L, and then returns the minimum cost for volume L.

Note that this program has a time complexity of O(n * L), which may not be efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution would be to use a more advanced algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm or a more optimized dynamic programming approach.
