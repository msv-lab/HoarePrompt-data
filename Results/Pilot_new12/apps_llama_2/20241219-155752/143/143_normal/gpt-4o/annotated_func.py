    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum achievable cost considering the accumulated minimum cost based on L and the dynamic programming (dp) list, where L is between 0 and 10^9, and dp is a list of 31 integers where each element is the minimum between its original value and the doubled minimum cost of the previous element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns the minimum achievable cost for purchasing a certain quantity of items, represented by the limit `L`, given the costs of different types of bottles, where the costs are stored in the `costs` list. The function accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of different types of bottles; `L`, the limit or quantity of items to be purchased; and `costs`, a list of integers representing the costs of the different types of bottles. The function utilizes dynamic programming to determine the most cost-effective approach, considering the option to either purchase a bottle of a specific type or to purchase two bottles of the next lower type. The function handles cases where `L` is less than or equal to the total number of bottles that can be purchased with the given costs, as well as cases where `L` exceeds this total. The function returns the minimum achievable cost as an integer, which can range from the sum of the costs of the bottles purchased to zero, depending on the input values. The function's output will always be the minimum cost required to purchase the desired quantity, considering the available bottle types and their respective costs.
