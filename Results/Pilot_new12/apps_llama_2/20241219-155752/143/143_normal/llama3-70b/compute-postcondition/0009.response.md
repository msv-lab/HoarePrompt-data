Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, and the rest are infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0; otherwise, the state remains as described in the precondition since there's no else part provided to alter it**
