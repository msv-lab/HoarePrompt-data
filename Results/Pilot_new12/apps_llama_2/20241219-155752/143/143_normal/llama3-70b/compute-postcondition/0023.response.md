The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. The current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, which is 2. The value of `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, and `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, and `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
