To calculate the output state, let's first understand what the given code snippet does. The code snippet is `vol = 2 ** j - 1`. 

Given that `j` is 1, we can calculate `vol` as follows:
`vol = 2 ** 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, `dp`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
