According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the loop counter `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables `L`, `costs`, `dp`, `i`, and `vol` are not affected by the loop counter `j`, so their states remain the same. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, and the rest are infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 0**
