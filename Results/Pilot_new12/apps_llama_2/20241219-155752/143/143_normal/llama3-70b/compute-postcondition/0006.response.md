To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the code snippet. The initial state gives us the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- `costs` is a list of input integers.
- `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are infinity.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
vol = 2 ** j - 1
```

Given that `j` is 0, we can calculate `vol` as follows:
- `2 ** j` equals `2 ** 0`, which is 1.
- Therefore, `vol = 1 - 1 = 0`.

Thus, the variable `vol` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**
