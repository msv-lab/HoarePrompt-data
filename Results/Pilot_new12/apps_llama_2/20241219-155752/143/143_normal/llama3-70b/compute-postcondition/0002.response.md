The code initializes a list `dp` with `L + 1` elements, all set to infinity. The variable `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements all set to infinity**
