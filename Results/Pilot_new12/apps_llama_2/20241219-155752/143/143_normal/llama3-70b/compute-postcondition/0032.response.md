Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[2]` equals `min(previous dp[2], dp[-1] + costs[2])`, otherwise the state of `dp` remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify it.**
