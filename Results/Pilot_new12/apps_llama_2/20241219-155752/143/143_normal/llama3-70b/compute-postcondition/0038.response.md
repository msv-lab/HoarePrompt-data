To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

The initial state gives us the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
- `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- `costs` is a list of input integers.
- `dp` is a list where:
  - `dp[0]` is 0.
  - `dp[1]` is the minimum cost for `i=1`.
  - `dp[2]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 2.
  - `dp[3]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, which is 3.

Given the code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
```

Since `i` is 3 and the value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, we have a few possible values for `vol`: 1, 2, or 3.

1. If `vol` is 1, then `dp[3]` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `dp[3-1] + costs[0]`, which simplifies to `min(dp[3], dp[2] + costs[0])`.
2. If `vol` is 2, then `dp[3]` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `dp[3-2] + costs[0]`, which simplifies to `min(dp[3], dp[1] + costs[0])`.
3. If `vol` is 3, then `dp[3]` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `dp[3-3] + costs[0]`, which simplifies to `min(dp[3], dp[0] + costs[0])`.

Given `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost for `i=1`, `dp[2]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 2, and `dp[3]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 3, after the update, `dp[3]` will hold the minimum cost considering the additional option of using a volume up to `vol` (1, 2, or 3) and the associated cost from `costs[0]`.

The values of `n`, `L`, `i`, and `j` do not change. The list `costs` also remains unchanged. The only update is to `dp[3]`, which now reflects the minimum cost considering an additional option based on `vol` and `costs[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost for `i=1`, `dp[2]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 2, and `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[3-vol] + costs[0]` for `vol` less than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 0**
