Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost for `i=1`, `dp[2]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 2, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[3-vol] + costs[0]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `vol` is updated according to the condition.***
