Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum of `costs[0]` and `costs[1]`, and the rest are infinity**
