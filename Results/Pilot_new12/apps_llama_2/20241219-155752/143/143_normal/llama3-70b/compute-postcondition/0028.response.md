Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2 - vol] + costs[j]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp[2]` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `dp[1] + costs[1]` if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.**
