The code creates a new list `costs` and assigns it the value of a list of integers, which are obtained by splitting the input string into substrings separated by spaces and converting each substring to an integer using the `map` function.

The initial state of `n` and `L` is not affected by this code. The value of `costs` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers**
