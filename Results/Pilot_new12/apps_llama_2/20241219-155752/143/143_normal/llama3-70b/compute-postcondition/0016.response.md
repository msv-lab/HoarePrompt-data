To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `vol` is 3

And the code:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
```

Here's the step-by-step impact:
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the sum of `dp[i - vol]` and `costs[j]`.
- Given that `i` is 1 and `vol` is 3, `i - vol` would be -2. However, the behavior of `dp[-2]` is undefined without knowing the specifics of how `dp` is initialized or defined beyond its normal indexing.
- Assuming `dp` is a list or array where negative indices are handled in a Pythonic manner (counting from the end), or if `dp` is designed to handle such indexing in a specific context, we proceed with the calculation.
- However, considering standard list behavior in Python, attempting to access an index that does not exist (like a negative index beyond the list's length or a positive index out of range) would raise an error. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `dp` is somehow defined to handle this operation, possibly through a custom class or a specific initialization that accommodates negative indices or out-of-range access in a defined manner.
- The value of `dp[i]` is now dependent on the minimum between its old value (if it existed) and the new calculated value `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`.
- Since `j` is 2, this implies accessing the third element of `costs` (assuming 0-based indexing).
- The values of `n`, `L`, `costs` (as a whole), `i`, `j`, and `vol` are not changed by this operation.

Given these considerations, and assuming `dp` can handle the indexing operation without error (either through standard Python negative indexing, custom handling, or predefined values for all possible indices), the output state is:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `vol` is 3
- `dp[1]` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value (if any) and `dp[-2] + costs[2]`, with the understanding that `dp[-2]` and `costs[2]` must be defined and accessible.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and `dp[1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[-2] + costs[2]`.**
