According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost for `i=1`, `dp[2]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 2, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[3-vol] + costs[0]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `vol` is updated according to the condition**
