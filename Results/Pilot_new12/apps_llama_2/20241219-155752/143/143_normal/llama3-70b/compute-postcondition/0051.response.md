The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it has access to input values where `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and there are `n` integers `c_1, c_2,..., c_{n}` (each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive) representing the costs of bottles of different types.

However, the problem description does not specify the return value of the function. To provide a complete description, I will assume the return value is based on the input values.

Since the return value is not specified, I will describe a general functionality. If the function is designed to calculate the minimum cost to buy bottles, it could return the minimum cost. If it's designed to determine the number of bottles that can be bought, it could return the count. If it's designed to find the combination of bottles, it could return a list or combination.

Without the specific return value or output, I can only provide a general description:

Functionality: **The function has access to input values n, L, and c_1 to c_n, and returns a result based on these input values, which could be a minimum cost, a count of bottles, or a combination of bottles.**
