The given code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` updates the value of `vol`. Given that `j` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `vol` as follows: `vol = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost for `i=1`, `dp[2]` is the minimum cost considering volumes up to 2, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[3-vol] + costs[0]`, otherwise `dp[3]` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `dp[2] + costs[1]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3.
