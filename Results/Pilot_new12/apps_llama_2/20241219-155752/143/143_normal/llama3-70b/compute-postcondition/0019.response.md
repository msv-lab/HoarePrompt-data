According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `L`. If `i` is less than `L + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). So, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, `i` is 2**
