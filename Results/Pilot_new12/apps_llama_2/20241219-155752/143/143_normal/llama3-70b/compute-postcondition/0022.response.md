Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, and `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, and all previously stated conditions for `n`, `L`, `costs`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` still hold**
