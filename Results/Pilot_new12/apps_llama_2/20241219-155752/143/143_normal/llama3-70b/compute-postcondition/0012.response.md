The given Python code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of its current value and the sum of `dp[i - vol]` and `costs[j]`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, and the rest are infinity
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `vol` is 1

Since `i` is 1 and `vol` is 1, `i - vol` equals 0. Therefore, `dp[i - vol]` is `dp[0]`, which is 0. 

So, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`dp[1]` which is `costs[0]`) and the sum of `dp[0]` (which is 0) and `costs[j]` (which is `costs[1]` because list indices in Python start at 0, but `j` is 1, so we access the second element of `costs`).

The values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, `i`, `j`, and `vol` do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum of `costs[0]` and `costs[1]`, and the rest are infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
