The code sets the value of `dp[0]` to 0. The previous value of `dp[0]` was infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is still an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is still a list of input integers. The list `dp` still has `L + 1` elements, but the first element `dp[0]` is now 0, and the rest of the elements are still set to infinity.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are infinity**
