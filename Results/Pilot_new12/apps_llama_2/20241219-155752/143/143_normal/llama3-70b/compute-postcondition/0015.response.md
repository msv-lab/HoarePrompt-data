The value of `vol` is updated to `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, `vol` becomes `2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3. Since `vol` (3) is greater than `i` (1), the condition for `dp` is no longer valid, so the value of `dp` is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**
