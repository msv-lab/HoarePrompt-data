The code defines two variables `n` and `L` and assigns them integer values from the input. `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `L` is assigned the second integer from the input. 

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), and the value of `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)**
