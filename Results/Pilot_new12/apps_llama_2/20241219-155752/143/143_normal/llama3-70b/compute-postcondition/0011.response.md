The given code assigns a new value to `vol`. The value of `j` is 1, and the expression `2 ** j - 1` is evaluated. 
`2 ** j - 1` equals `2 ** 1 - 1` equals `2 - 1` equals `1`. Therefore, `vol` is assigned the value `1`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[0]`, and the rest are infinity, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
