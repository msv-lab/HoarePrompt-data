The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. Given that `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the update affects `dp[2]`. 

Since `i` equals 2 and `vol` equals 1, `dp[2]` becomes the minimum of its current value and `dp[2 - 1] + costs[1]`, which simplifies to the minimum of `dp[2]` and `dp[1] + costs[1]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[1] + costs[1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum cost that can be achieved using the elements of `costs` and the volumes calculated from `n`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[1] + costs[1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
