The function calculates the minimum cost to fill a capacity `L` using bottles of different types with costs `c_1` to `c_n`, where each bottle type has a volume equal to `2^i - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The function takes no parameters but reads `n` and `L` from input, followed by `n` costs. It returns the minimum cost if it's possible to fill the capacity, otherwise, it returns `-1`. The input values `n` and `L` are integers between 1 and 30 (inclusive) and 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), respectively. The costs `c_1` to `c_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function handles edge cases where `L` is 0, in which case it doesn't change the `dp` array, and where it's impossible to fill the capacity, in which case it returns `-1`. The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost efficiently.
