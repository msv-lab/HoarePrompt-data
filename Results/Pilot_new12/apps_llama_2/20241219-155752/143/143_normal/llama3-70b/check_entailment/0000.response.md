Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle cases where the required volume `L` exceeds the sum of volumes of all bottles. In such cases, the program should still try to buy the maximum volume of lemonade possible, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

A specific case where the program fails is when `n = 1`, `L = 10`, and `costs = [10]`. The program will output `inf`, indicating that it is not possible to buy at least 10 liters of lemonade, but in reality, you can buy 10 bottles of 1-liter lemonade for a total cost of 100 roubles.

The program also does not handle cases where the costs of bottles are 0. In such cases, the program should output 0, because you can buy any amount of lemonade for free.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to handle cases where `L` exceeds the sum of volumes of all bottles, and to handle cases where the costs of bottles are 0.

Here is a modified version of the program that correctly handles these cases:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_vol = sum(2 ** i - 1 for i in range(n))
    if L > max_vol:
        print("Not enough volume")
        return
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L]!= float('inf') else -1)

```

However, this is still not correct because it can exceed the maximum recursion depth if `L` is large, and it does not handle cases where the costs of bottles are 0 correctly.

A correct version of the program would use a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm that can handle large values of `L`. Here is an example of a correct version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                if dp[i - vol]!= float('inf'):
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    buy = []
    i = L
    while i > 0:
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i and dp[i] == dp[i - vol] + costs[j]:
                buy.append((vol, costs[j]))
                i -= vol
                break
    print(sum([x[1] for x in buy]))

```
