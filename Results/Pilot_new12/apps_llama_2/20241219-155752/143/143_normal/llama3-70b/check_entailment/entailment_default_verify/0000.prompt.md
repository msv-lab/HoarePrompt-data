You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle cases where the required volume `L` exceeds the sum of volumes of all bottles. In such cases, the program should still try to buy the maximum volume of lemonade possible, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

A specific case where the program fails is when `n = 1`, `L = 10`, and `costs = [10]`. The program will output `inf`, indicating that it is not possible to buy at least 10 liters of lemonade, but in reality, you can buy 10 bottles of 1-liter lemonade for a total cost of 100 roubles.

The program also does not handle cases where the costs of bottles are 0. In such cases, the program should output 0, because you can buy any amount of lemonade for free.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to handle cases where `L` exceeds the sum of volumes of all bottles, and to handle cases where the costs of bottles are 0.

Here is a modified version of the program that correctly handles these cases:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_vol = sum(2 ** i - 1 for i in range(n))
    if L > max_vol:
        print("Not enough volume")
        return
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L]!= float('inf') else -1)

```

However, this is still not correct because it can exceed the maximum recursion depth if `L` is large, and it does not handle cases where the costs of bottles are 0 correctly.

A correct version of the program would use a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm that can handle large values of `L`. Here is an example of a correct version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                if dp[i - vol]!= float('inf'):
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    buy = []
    i = L
    while i > 0:
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i and dp[i] == dp[i - vol] + costs[j]:
                buy.append((vol, costs[j]))
                i -= vol
                break
    print(sum([x[1] for x in buy]))

```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates the minimum cost to fill a capacity `L` using bottles of different types with costs `c_1` to `c_n`, where each bottle type has a volume equal to `2^i - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The function takes no parameters but reads `n` and `L` from input, followed by `n` costs. It returns the minimum cost if it's possible to fill the capacity, otherwise, it returns `-1`. The input values `n` and `L` are integers between 1 and 30 (inclusive) and 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), respectively. The costs `c_1` to `c_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function handles edge cases where `L` is 0, in which case it doesn't change the `dp` array, and where it's impossible to fill the capacity, in which case it returns `-1`. The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost efficiently.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
