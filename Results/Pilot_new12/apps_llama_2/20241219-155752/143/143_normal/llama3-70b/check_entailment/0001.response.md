Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but it has a flaw. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the volume of each bottle. The problem statement specifies that a single bottle of type `i` has a volume of `2^i - 1` liters. However, the program uses `vol = 2 ** j - 1` to calculate the volume, where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. This means that the program does not correctly calculate the volumes for bottles of type `n-1` or higher.

To fix this, the program should calculate the volume as `2 ** (j + 1) - 1` instead, since `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` and the problem statement uses `i` which ranges from `1` to `n`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1  # Corrected calculation
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L]!= float('inf') else -1)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all inputs. However, the original program does not work correctly for all cases, such as when `n` is large and the volumes of the bottles are large as well. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is **False**.
