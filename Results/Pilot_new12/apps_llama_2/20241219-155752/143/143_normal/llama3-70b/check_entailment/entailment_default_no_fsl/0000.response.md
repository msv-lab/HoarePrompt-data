Correctness: **True**

The code provided uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost to fill a capacity `L` using bottles of different types with costs `c_1` to `c_n`. The code handles edge cases where `L` is 0 or where it's impossible to fill the capacity.

The problem description requires finding the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade. The code correctly implements this by initializing a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `L + 1` with all elements set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. Then, it iterates over each volume from 1 to `L` and for each volume, it iterates over each bottle type. If the current bottle type can be used to fill the current volume, it updates the minimum cost in the `dp` array.

The code also correctly handles the case where it's impossible to fill the capacity by returning `-1` if the minimum cost at the `L`-th index in the `dp` array is still infinity.

The provided examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, the output is `150`, which corresponds to buying one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each, resulting in a total cost of 150 roubles.

In summary, the code provided correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles all edge cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
