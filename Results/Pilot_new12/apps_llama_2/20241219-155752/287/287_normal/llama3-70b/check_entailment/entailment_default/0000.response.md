Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not follow the problem description and does not calculate the number of different weights of splits for a given number `n`. Instead, it calculates the total number of divisors of `n`. 

For example, given the input `7`, the correct output should be `4`, as there are four different weights of splits of `7`: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`. However, the code calculates the total number of divisors of `7`, which is `2` (`1` and `7`), not the number of different weights of splits.

The code provided is a solution to a different problem, which is to count the number of divisors of a given integer, not to count the number of different weights of splits. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

This can be seen from the output hints, which explicitly state that the function calculates and prints the total number of divisors of a given integer input `n`, which is different from the problem description. 

So the program does not work as expected for every potential case and therefore Correctness: **False**.
