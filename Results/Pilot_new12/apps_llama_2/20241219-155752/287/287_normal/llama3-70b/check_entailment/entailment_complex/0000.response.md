Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. It calculates the total number of divisors of the input integer `n`, rather than the number of different weights of its splits.

The problem description asks to find the number of different weights of splits of `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sums up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The provided program, however, calculates the number of divisors of `n` by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` and checking for divisibility.

For example, given the input `7`, the program will output `4` because `7` has 4 divisors: 1, 7. However, according to the problem description, the correct output for input `7` should be `4` because there are 4 different weights of splits of `7`: [7], [3, 3, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But this coincidence does not imply that the program is correct, because it does not actually calculate the weights of splits.

A correct program would need to generate all possible splits of `n`, calculate the weight of each split, and then count the number of unique weights. The provided program does not perform these steps and therefore does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
