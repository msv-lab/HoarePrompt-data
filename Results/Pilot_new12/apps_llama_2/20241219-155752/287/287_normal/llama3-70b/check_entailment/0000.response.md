Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly count the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. 

The program appears to be counting the number of factors of `n`, which is not the same as the number of different weights of splits. The weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element, which is not directly related to the factors of `n`.

For example, if `n` is 7, the program will only count the factors of 7 (1 and 7), whereas the problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of 7, which includes weights 1, 2, 3, and 7, corresponding to the splits [7], [3, 3, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to generate all possible splits of `n` and count the number of different weights among these splits. 

This can be achieved by generating all possible combinations of numbers that sum up to `n` and then counting the weight of each combination. The weight of a combination is the number of elements that are equal to the first element. 

Here's an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def count_weights(n):
    weights = set()
    def backtrack(start, path, n):
        if n == 0:
            weights.add(path.count(path[0]))
        for i in range(start, n + 1):
            if i <= n:
                backtrack(i, path + [i], n - i)
    backtrack(1, [], n)
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(count_weights(n))
```
This code correctly generates all possible splits of `n` and counts the number of different weights among them. It uses a recursive function to generate all possible combinations of numbers that sum up to `n`, and it uses a set to store the unique weights. Finally, it returns the number of unique weights, which is the correct answer to the problem.
