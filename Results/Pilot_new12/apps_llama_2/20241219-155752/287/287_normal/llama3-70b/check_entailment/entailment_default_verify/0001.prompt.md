You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.

Input
9

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the number of different weights of the splits of a given number `n`. However, the provided program does not calculate the weights of the splits correctly.

The program is counting the divisors of `n` instead of counting the different weights of the splits of `n`. A weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The program does not take into account the concept of splits and their weights.

For example, when the input is 7, the program outputs 4, which is correct. However, this is just a coincidence. The program is not correctly calculating the weights of the splits.

A correct approach to this problem would be to generate all possible splits of `n` and then calculate the weight of each split. The program would then need to count the number of unique weights.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: 12

The program will output 6, which is the number of divisors of 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). However, the correct output should be the number of different weights of the splits of 12.

For example, some possible splits of 12 are:
- [12] with weight 1
- [6, 6] with weight 2
- [4, 4, 4] with weight 3
- [3, 3, 3, 3] with weight 4
- [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] with weight 6
- [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with weight 12

The correct output for the input 12 should be the number of unique weights, which is not 6.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints the total number of divisors of a given integer input `n`, with a correction to account for perfect squares by subtracting 1 from the count. It accepts an integer `n` through user input, such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, and does not return any value. After execution, the program has printed the total number of divisors of `n` to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
