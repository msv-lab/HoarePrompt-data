Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the number of different weights of the splits of a given number `n`. However, the provided program does not calculate the weights of the splits correctly.

The program is counting the divisors of `n` instead of counting the different weights of the splits of `n`. A weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The program does not take into account the concept of splits and their weights.

For example, when the input is 7, the program outputs 4, which is correct. However, this is just a coincidence. The program is not correctly calculating the weights of the splits.

A correct approach to this problem would be to generate all possible splits of `n` and then calculate the weight of each split. The program would then need to count the number of unique weights.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: 12

The program will output 6, which is the number of divisors of 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). However, the correct output should be the number of different weights of the splits of 12.

For example, some possible splits of 12 are:
- [12] with weight 1
- [6, 6] with weight 2
- [4, 4, 4] with weight 3
- [3, 3, 3, 3] with weight 4
- [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] with weight 6
- [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with weight 12

The correct output for the input 12 should be the number of unique weights, which is not 6.
