Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9, `i` is 3. If `i` squared equals `n`, then `res` is 0 or 2 if `n` equals 9, or is 1 or 3 for odd `n` greater than 9. If `i` squared does not equal `n`, then if `n` is divisible by `i`, `res` is 1 or 3 if `n` equals 9, or is 2 or 4 for odd `n` greater than 9, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, which could be -1 or 1 if `n` equals 9, or remains 0 or 2 for odd `n` greater than 9.***
