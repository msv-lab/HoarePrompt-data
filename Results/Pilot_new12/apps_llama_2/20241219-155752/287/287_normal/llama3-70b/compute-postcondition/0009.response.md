To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given code and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), with `i` being the loop variable. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, the square root of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `res` depends on whether `n` is a perfect square or a multiple of `i`, but its current value does not affect the loop's continuation. However, we should note its possible values based on the conditions given:

- If `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `i` * `i` equals `n`), then `res` is 1. Given that `i` will be 2 in the next iteration, `n` would need to be 4 for this condition to be true.
- If `n` is a multiple of `i`, then `res` is 2. With `i` being 2 in the next iteration, `n` needs to be an even number greater than 1 for this condition to potentially be true.
- Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged as 0.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time:

- `n` must be such that its square root is greater than or equal to 2 (meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 4) because `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
- `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
- The value of `res` will depend on the relationship between `n` and `i`, but for the loop to continue, we don't need to specify `res`'s value precisely, just that it can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4, `i` is 2, `res` is either 0, 1 (if `n` equals 4), or 2 (if `n` is an even number greater than 2)**
