Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4, `i` is 2. If `n` is even, `res` is 3 (if `n` equals 4), or 4 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4). If `n` is odd, `res` remains either 0, 1 (if `n` equals an odd number that was initially 4, but this is not possible since n % i!= 0 for odd n and i = 2), or 2 (if `n` is an odd number and `n` >= 4), effectively `res` remains 0 or 2 for odd `n`.**
