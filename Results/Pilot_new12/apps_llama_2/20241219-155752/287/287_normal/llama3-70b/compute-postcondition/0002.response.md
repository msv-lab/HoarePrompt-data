According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to the square root of `n`, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. However, given that `n` is already an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `n` is guaranteed to be greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `res` is 0. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 1 as it is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
