To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

1. The loop iterates over `range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means `i` will take values from 1 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, it will be incremented to 3 at the start of the next iteration.
4. The condition for `n` remains that it must be an integer such that `n` >= 4, but since `i` is now 3, the square of `i` (which is 9) should be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue. This implies that `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to execute again with `i` = 3.

Given the rules for updating `res` based on whether `i` squared equals `n` and the parity of `n`, and considering that `i` will be 3 in the next iteration:
- If `n` = 9 (which is odd and equals `i` squared), `res` could be -1 or 1.
- If `n` is not 9 but `n` >= 9, then `i` squared does not equal `n`. For `n` being odd and greater than 9, `res` remains 0 or 2.

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, considering `i` will be incremented to 3 and `n` must support this increment:
State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9, `i` is 3, `res` could be -1 or 1 if `n` equals 9, or remains 0 or 2 for odd `n` greater than 9, or follows the rules for even `n` if applicable**
