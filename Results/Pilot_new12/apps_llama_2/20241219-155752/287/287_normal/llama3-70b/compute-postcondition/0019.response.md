To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        res += 2
    if i * i == n:
        res -= 1
```
From the loop code, we can see that the loop iterates over all numbers `i` from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it increments `res` by 2. Additionally, if `i` squared equals `n`, it decrements `res` by 1.

Let's consider the possible cases:

1. `n` is a perfect square: In this case, `i` squared equals `n` for some `i`. The loop will increment `res` by 2 for each divisor `i` of `n`, and then decrement `res` by 1 when `i` squared equals `n`. Since `n` has an odd number of divisors (including 1 and itself), the final value of `res` will be odd.
2. `n` is not a perfect square: In this case, `i` squared never equals `n`. The loop will increment `res` by 2 for each divisor `i` of `n`. Since `n` has an even number of divisors (excluding the case where `n` is a perfect square), the final value of `res` will be even.

Now, let's consider the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished. We can see that:

* `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.
* `i` will be equal to the square root of `n` (if `n` is a perfect square) or the largest number less than or equal to the square root of `n` (if `n` is not a perfect square).
* `res` will be equal to the number of divisors of `n`, minus 1 if `n` is a perfect square.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `res` is the number of divisors of `n`, minus 1 if `n` is a perfect square.**
