The code increments the value of `res` by 2. The initial value of `res` depends on the value of `n`: it is 0, 1 (if `n` equals 4), or 2 (if `n` is an even number greater than 2). 

- If `n` equals 4, `res` was 1, so `res` becomes 1 + 2 = 3.
- If `n` is an even number greater than 4, `res` was 2, so `res` becomes 2 + 2 = 4.
- If `n` is not an even number (i.e., `n` is odd and `n` >= 4 is not an even number greater than 2, but an odd number, since even numbers greater than 2 are already considered), and not equal to 4, `res` was 0, so `res` becomes 0 + 2 = 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4, `i` is 2, `res` is 3 (if `n` equals 4), 4 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4), or 2 (if `n` is an odd number and `n` >= 4, since we only had 0, 1 or 2 initially).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4, `i` is 2, `res` is 3 (if `n` equals 4), 4 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4), or 2 (if `n` is an odd number and `n` >= 4)**
