The code increments the value of `res` by 2. The initial value of `res` is 0, so the new value of `res` is 0 + 2 = 2. The states of the other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `n` is a multiple of `i`.**
