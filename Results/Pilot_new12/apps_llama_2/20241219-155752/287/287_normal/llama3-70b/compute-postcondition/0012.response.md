The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. 

If `n` is even, `res` was 3 (if `n` equals 4), or 4 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4). So, after decreasing by 1, `res` will be 2 (if `n` equals 4), or 3 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4).

If `n` is odd, `res` was either 0 or 2. So, after decreasing by 1, `res` will be -1 or 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4, `i` is 2. If `n` is even, `res` is 2 (if `n` equals 4), or 3 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4). If `n` is odd, `res` is -1 or 1.**
