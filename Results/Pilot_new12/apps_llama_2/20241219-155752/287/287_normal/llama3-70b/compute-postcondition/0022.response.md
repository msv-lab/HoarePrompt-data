Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the total number of divisors of a given integer input `n`, with a correction to account for perfect squares by subtracting 1 from the count. It accepts an integer `n` through user input, such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, and does not return any value. After execution, the program has printed the total number of divisors of `n` to the console.**
