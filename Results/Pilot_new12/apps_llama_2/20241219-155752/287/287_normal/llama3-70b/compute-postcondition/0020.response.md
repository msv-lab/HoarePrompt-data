The code provided is a print statement that outputs the value of `res`. This operation does not modify any variables, it simply outputs the current value of `res` to the console. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the largest number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `res` is the number of divisors of `n`, minus 1 if `n` is a perfect square, and the value of `res` has been printed**
