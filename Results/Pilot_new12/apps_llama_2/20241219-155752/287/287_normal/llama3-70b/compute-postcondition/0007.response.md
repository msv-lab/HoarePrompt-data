The value of `res` is decreased by 1. Given that `i` squared equals `n`, `i` is the square root of `n`. Since `n` is an integer, `i` must also be an integer. The initial value of `res` is determined by whether `n` is a multiple of `i`. Since `i` is the square root of `n`, `n` is always a multiple of `i` when `i` is an integer. Therefore, the initial value of `res` is 2. After decreasing `res` by 1, the new value of `res` becomes 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `i` remains the square root of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is the square root of `n`, `res` is 1**
