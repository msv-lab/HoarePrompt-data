Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 4, `i` is 2. If `i` squared equals `n`, then if `n` is even, `res` is 2 (if `n` equals 4), or 3 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4). If `n` is odd, `res` is -1 or 1. If `i` squared does not equal `n`, then `res` remains 3 (if `n` equals 4), or 4 (if `n` is an even number greater than 4) when `n` is even. When `n` is odd, `res` remains 0 or 2 for `n` >= 4.**
