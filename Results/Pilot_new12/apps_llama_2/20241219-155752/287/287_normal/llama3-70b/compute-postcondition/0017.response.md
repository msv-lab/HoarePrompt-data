To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given code snippet affects it.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9.
- `i` is 3.
- If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is 1 or 3 if `n` equals 9, or is 2 or 4 for odd `n` greater than 9.
- If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `res` remains unchanged, which could be -1 or 1 if `n` equals 9, or remains 0 or 2 for odd `n` greater than 9.

Given the code `res -= 1`, we are decreasing the value of `res` by 1.

So, the new values of `res` will be:
- If `n` is 9 and `res` was 1, `res` becomes 0. If `res` was 3, `res` becomes 2.
- For odd `n` greater than 9, if `res` was 2, `res` becomes 1. If `res` was 4, `res` becomes 3.
- If `n` is not divisible by `i` (which means `n` is not a multiple of 3 since `i` is 3), and `res` could be -1 or 1 if `n` equals 9 (but this condition cannot be true since 9 is divisible by 3, so we actually consider `n` > 9), or `res` could be 0 or 2 for odd `n` greater than 9. For these cases, if `res` was -1, it becomes -2. If `res` was 1 (for the condition that doesn't apply), it would become 0. For odd `n` greater than 9 not divisible by 3, if `res` was 0, it becomes -1. If `res` was 2, it becomes 1.

Given these considerations, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9.
- `i` is 3.
- If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is 0 or 2 if `n` equals 9, or is 1 or 3 for odd `n` greater than 9.
- If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `res` could be -2 or -1 (for the case where `n` > 9 and initially `res` was -1 or 0), or `res` could be 0 or 1 for odd `n` greater than 9 (for the cases where initially `res` was 1 or 2).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9, `i` is 3, if `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is 0 or 2 if `n` equals 9, or is 1 or 3 for odd `n` greater than 9, if `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `res` could be -2 or -1 or 0 or 1.**
