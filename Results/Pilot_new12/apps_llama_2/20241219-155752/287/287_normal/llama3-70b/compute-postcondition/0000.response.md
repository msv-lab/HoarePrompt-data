The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n` after converting it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that the input is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, the value of `n` will be an integer within this range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is equal to the input integer**
