Given the initial state and the code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables.

- `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9.
- `i` is 3.
- `res` could be -1 or 1 if `n` equals 9, or remains 0 or 2 for odd `n` greater than 9, or follows the rules for even `n` if applicable.

The code `res += 2` increments the value of `res` by 2.

So, if `res` was -1, it becomes 1. If `res` was 1, it becomes 3. If `res` was 0, it becomes 2. If `res` was 2, it becomes 4.

Given these changes, the output state is:

- `n` is still an integer such that `n` >= 9.
- `i` remains 3.
- `res` is now 1 or 3 if `n` equals 9, or is 2 or 4 for odd `n` greater than 9, or follows the updated rules for even `n` if applicable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 9, `i` is 3, `res` is 1 or 3 if `n` equals 9, or is 2 or 4 for odd `n` greater than 9**
