#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `num` is unchanged, `i` is `floor(sqrt(original num)) + 1`, and `count` is the total number of divisors of the original `num`
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of divisors of the original 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single positive integer parameter `num` and returns the total number of divisors of `num`, including both perfect square divisors counted once and other divisors counted in pairs, without modifying the original input `num`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `num` is a perfect square, and it does not perform any error checking on the input `num`, thus assuming it will always be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 as stated in the initial condition. After the function concludes, the original `num` remains unchanged, and the returned value provides the total count of divisors for the given `num`.
