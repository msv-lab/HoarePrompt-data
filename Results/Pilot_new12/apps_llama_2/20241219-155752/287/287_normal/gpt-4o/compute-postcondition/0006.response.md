The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` will be 2. The states of the other variables, `num` and `i`, are not affected. The condition that `num` is a positive integer, `num` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is not equal to the integer division of `num` by `i` remains valid.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, `num` % `i` equals 0, and `i` is not equal to the integer division of `num` by `i`.**
