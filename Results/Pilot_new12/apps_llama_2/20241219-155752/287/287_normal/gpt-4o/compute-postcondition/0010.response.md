To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `i * i <= num`. 

For the loop to execute again, this condition must be satisfied. Given that `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `2 * 2 <= num` is still true for the next iteration. However, since we're considering the state after the previous iteration and looking ahead to the next, we should actually consider the value of `i` after it has been potentially incremented in the loop body (which we don't see), so `i` would be at least 3 for the condition to be relevant for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time with `i` potentially being 3 (since we don't know the exact increment but know `i` is 2 and needs to increase to satisfy a potential next iteration), we need `3 * 3 <= num` to be true. This means `9 <= num`.

Given `num` is a positive integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`, for the loop to potentially execute one more time, `num` must be at least 9 or greater.

The state of `count` (whether it's 0 or 2, depending on `num` being even and not 4) does not affect the loop's condition directly. Therefore, the adjustment needed is primarily related to ensuring `num` is sufficiently large for the next iteration.

State: **`num` must be at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is even and not 4, `count` could be 2; otherwise, `count` remains 0**
