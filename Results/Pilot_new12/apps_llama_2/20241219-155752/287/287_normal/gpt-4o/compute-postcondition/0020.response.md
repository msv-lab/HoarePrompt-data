Postcondition: **`num` is at least 16, `i` is 3. Since there is no else part, the condition `num % i == 0` being true or false only affects the if part. If `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), then `count` remains as it was after being increased by 1. If `num` is not divisible by `i`, then `count` is increased by 2.**
