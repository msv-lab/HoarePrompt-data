Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `num` % `i` equals 0, and `i` is 1. If `i` is not equal to the integer division of `num` by `i`, then `count` is 2. Since there is no else part, if `i` equals the integer division of `num` by `i`, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition, meaning `count` remains 1.***
