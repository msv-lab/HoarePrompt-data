The code increments `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `num` is at least 16 and `i` is 3, after executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 4. The states of `num` and the condition regarding `num` and `i` (whether `num` is divisible by `i`) are not affected by this operation. The initial state also mentions a condition affecting `count` based on the divisibility of `num` by `i`, but the provided code snippet does not directly alter `count` or its condition; it only increments `i`.

Output State: **`num` is at least 16, `i` is 4**
