According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` squared is less than or equal to `num`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 0, and `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, `i` squared is also 1. For the loop to execute, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1, which is already given. However, to guarantee that the loop can execute at least one time with the given condition, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1 and since `i` is already 1, the condition is already met for any positive `num`. 

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
