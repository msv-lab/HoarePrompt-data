To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `num` must be at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is even and not 4, `count` could be 2; otherwise, `count` remains 0.

The given code is: 
```
count += 1
```
This code increments the value of `count` by 1.

Given that `count` could be 2 if `num` is even and not 4, or 0 otherwise, after incrementing by 1, `count` could be 3 if `num` is even and not 4, or 1 if `num` is not even or is 4.

Other variables are not affected, so `num` is still at least 9 and `i` is still 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 3; otherwise, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`num` is at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 3; otherwise, `count` is 1**
