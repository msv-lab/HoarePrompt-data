The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3, and `count` is increased by 1**
