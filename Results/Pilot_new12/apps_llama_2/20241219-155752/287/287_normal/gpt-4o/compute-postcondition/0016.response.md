To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i * i <= num`. 

1. The loop can execute again if `i * i` is less than or equal to `num`. 
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so `i * i` is 9.
3. Since `num` is at least 9, we need to ensure that `num` is greater than 9 to guarantee that the loop can execute again when `i` is incremented to 4 (because `4 * 4` is 16).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted to be at least greater than 9 (since we don't know the exact value of `num`, just that it's at least 9), and considering the loop condition, it actually needs to be greater than or equal to 16 when `i` is incremented.

However, considering the provided conditions and focusing strictly on the loop condition `i * i <= num`, the states need to reflect the possibility of the loop executing again based on `i` and `num`. Given `i` is 3, for the loop to potentially execute again with `i` incrementing, `num` must be sufficient to satisfy `i * i <= num` when `i` increases.

Since `i` is currently 3, and we're considering the next iteration where `i` would be 4, `num` must be at least 16 or more for the condition to hold true when `i` increments. Thus, focusing on the condition provided and the task at hand:

State: **`num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3**
