The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 3; otherwise, `count` is 1. After incrementing by 1, if `num` is even and not 4, `count` becomes 4; otherwise, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 4; otherwise, `count` is 2.
Output State: **`num` is at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 4; otherwise, `count` is 2**
