Postcondition: ***`num` is at least 9, `i` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `num` divided by `i` (i.e., `num` is not divisible by `i`), then if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 4; otherwise, `count` is 2. If `i` is equal to `num` divided by `i` (i.e., `num` is divisible by `i`), then the state remains as in the precondition: if `num` is even and not 4, `count` is 3; otherwise, `count` is 1.***
