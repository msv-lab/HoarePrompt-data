To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given information and the loop's code.

The loop continues as long as `i * i <= num`. This means `i` will increment until `i * i` exceeds `num`, at which point the loop will terminate. 

Inside the loop, if `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), `count` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not equal to `num // i` (meaning `i` is not the square root of `num`), `count` is incremented by 1 again. This effectively counts the divisors of `num`, considering that each divisor `i` has a corresponding divisor `num // i`, except when `i` is the square root of `num`, in which case it only counts once.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe patterns but need to focus on the loop's termination condition and the update logic for `count`.

The loop will terminate when `i * i > num`, meaning `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `num`. At this point, `i` will be `floor(sqrt(num)) + 1`, where `floor` denotes rounding down to the nearest integer.

For `count`, it accumulates the number of divisors of `num`. If `num` has a divisor `i`, it also has a divisor `num // i`, unless `i` equals `num // i` (which happens when `i` is the square root of `num`).

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed will be:

- `num` remains unchanged as it's not updated within the loop.
- `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `num`, which is `floor(sqrt(num)) + 1`.
- `count` will hold the total number of divisors of the original `num`. This includes both `i` and `num // i` for each divisor `i`, except when `i` is the square root of `num`, in which case it only counts once.

Output State: **`num` is unchanged, `i` is `floor(sqrt(original num)) + 1`, and `count` is the total number of divisors of the original `num`**
