The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables, `num` and `i`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by the current value of `i`, meaning num % i equals 0**
