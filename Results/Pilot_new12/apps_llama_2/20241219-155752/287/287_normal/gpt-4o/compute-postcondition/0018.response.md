The code increments `count` by 1. The initial state is: `num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3, and `count` is increased by 1. 

After the execution of the code, the value of `count` is increased by 1 again. The values of `num` and `i` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3, and `count` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3, and `count` is increased by 2**
