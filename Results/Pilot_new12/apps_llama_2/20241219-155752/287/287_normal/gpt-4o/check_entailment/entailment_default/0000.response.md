Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not accurately solve the problem as described. It calculates the total number of divisors of a given number, including both perfect square divisors counted once and other divisors counted in pairs. However, the problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given number $n$, where the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

For example, given the input $n = 7$, the code will return the total number of divisors of $7$, which is $2$ (since $7$ has only two divisors, $1$ and $7$). However, the correct answer to the problem is $4$, since there are four possible weights of splits of $7$: $1$ ($[7]$), $2$ ($[3, 3, 1]$), $3$ ($[2, 2, 2, 1]$), and $7$ ($[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$).

The code provided does not take into account the concept of splits and their weights, and instead focuses solely on calculating the number of divisors of the input number. Therefore, it does not accurately solve the problem as described, and its correctness is **False**.
