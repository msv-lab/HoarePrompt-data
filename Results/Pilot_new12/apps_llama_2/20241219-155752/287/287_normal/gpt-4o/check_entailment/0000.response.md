Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The given program calculates the number of divisors of the number, not the number of different weights of its splits. 

A counterexample is when the input is 8. The program outputs 4 (the number of divisors of 8), but the correct answer is 5 (the possible weights of splits of 8 are: Weight 1: [8], Weight 2: [4, 4], Weight 3: [3, 3, 2], Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2], and Weight 8: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]). 

The correct solution to the problem involves generating all possible splits of the number and then counting the number of different weights of these splits. 

Here is a correct Python solution for the problem:
```python
def count_weights(n):
    weights = set()
    def split(n, max_num, current_split):
        if n == 0:
            first_num = current_split[0]
            weight = sum(1 for num in current_split if num == first_num)
            weights.add(weight)
        elif n > 0:
            for i in range(min(max_num, n), 0, -1):
                split(n - i, i, current_split + [i])
    split(n, n, [])
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(count_weights(n))
```
