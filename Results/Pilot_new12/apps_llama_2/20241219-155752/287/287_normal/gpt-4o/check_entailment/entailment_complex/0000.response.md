Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements equal to the first element.

However, the provided program calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, which is a different problem. The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` and counts the divisors, but this approach has no relation to finding the weights of splits.

A correct solution would need to generate all possible splits of `n`, calculate the weight of each split, and return the number of unique weights found. The provided program does not attempt to solve the problem in this manner, and therefore does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

For example, given the input `7`, the program will return `4` because `7` has four divisors (`1`, `7`), but the problem description expects the output `4` because there are four different weights of splits of `7`: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`, corresponding to the splits `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. This shows that the program does not provide the correct solution to the problem.
