Correctness: **False**

The given code is calculating the number of divisors of the input number `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits. 

To calculate the number of different weights of its splits, we would need to generate all possible splits of `n` and then calculate the weight of each split. The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

For example, if the input is 7, the possible splits are: [7], [6, 1], [5, 2], [5, 1, 1], [4, 3], [4, 2, 1], [4, 1, 1, 1], [3, 3, 1], [3, 2, 2], [3, 2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. 

Then we calculate the weight of each split: 
- Weight 1: [7] 
- Weight 1: [6, 1] 
- Weight 1: [5, 2] 
- Weight 1: [5, 1, 1] 
- Weight 1: [4, 3] 
- Weight 1: [4, 2, 1] 
- Weight 1: [4, 1, 1, 1] 
- Weight 2: [3, 3, 1] 
- Weight 1: [3, 2, 2] 
- Weight 1: [3, 2, 1, 1] 
- Weight 1: [3, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
- Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1] 
- Weight 2: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] 
- Weight 1: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] 
- Weight 1: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
- Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

So the different weights are 1, 2, 3, 7. Therefore, the output should be 4.

In the provided code, there is no logic to generate all possible splits of `n` and then calculate the weight of each split. Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case. 

Here is a simple case when the program does not work correctly: if the input is 7, the output of the program is 4 which is equal to the number of divisors of 7 (1, 7), not the number of different weights of its splits. However, the explanation provided does not exactly match the output of the given code for the given input, since the code does not output the correct number of divisors for the given input, it looks like we made an error. Let's analyze it again.

For input 7: The divisors are (1, 7), so count would be 2, because we count both the divisors and they are different.

For input 8: The divisors are (1, 8), (2, 4), so count would be 4.

For input 9: The divisors are (1, 9), (3, 3), so count would be 3.

The given code calculates the total number of divisors of `num`, not the number of different weights of its splits. So the output of the code is not as expected.

So the program does not work correctly for every potential case.
