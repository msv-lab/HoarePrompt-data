Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`. The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

The provided program does not implement this logic. It seems to be counting the number of divisors of `n`, which is not related to the concept of splits and their weights. 

For example, for the input `7`, the program will output `4` (since `7` has `4` divisors: `1`, `7`), but this is a coincidence. The correct output for `7` is indeed `4`, but the program arrives at this answer by counting divisors, not by counting the different weights of splits.

A counterexample can be found for the input `12`. The different weights of splits of `12` are `1` (for the split `[12]`), `2` (for the split `[6, 6]`), `3` (for the split `[4, 4, 4]`), and `4` (for the split `[3, 3, 3, 3]`), `6` (for the split `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`), and `12` (for the split `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`). So, the correct output for `12` is `6`. However, the program will output `6` as well (since `12` has `6` divisors: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `12`), which is again a coincidence.

Another counterexample can be found for the input `13`. The different weights of splits of `13` are `1` (for the split `[13]`), `2` (for the split `[6, 6, 1]`), `3` (for the split `[4, 4, 4, 1]`), `4` (for the split `[3, 3, 3, 4]`), and `13` (for the split `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`). So, the correct output for `13` is `5`. However, the program will output `4` (since `13` has `2` divisors: `1`, `13` but the code doubles it because `13` is a square), which is incorrect.

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. It counts the divisors of `n`, which is a different problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
