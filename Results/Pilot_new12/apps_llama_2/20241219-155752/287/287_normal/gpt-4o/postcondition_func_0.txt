The function accepts a single positive integer parameter `num` and returns the total number of divisors of `num`, including both perfect square divisors counted once and other divisors counted in pairs, without modifying the original input `num`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `num` is a perfect square, and it does not perform any error checking on the input `num`, thus assuming it will always be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 as stated in the initial condition. After the function concludes, the original `num` remains unchanged, and the returned value provides the total count of divisors for the given `num`.
