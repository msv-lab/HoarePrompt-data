Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The main issue lies in the calculation of the coverage area in the `coverage` function. The function calculates the area that a scoop-net of size `r` can cover around a given position `(x, y)` in an `n` by `m` grid, taking into account the grid boundaries. However, it does not accurately represent the coverage area that a scoop-net would actually cover.

Another issue is with the `func_1` function, which calculates the average of the `k` highest coverage values across all possible positions in a rectangular grid of size `n` by `m`, with a window size of `r` by `r`. The function uses a heap to store the coverage values, but it does not update the coverage values after each fish is added. This means that the function is not actually maximizing the expected value of the number of caught fishes.

Furthermore, the code does not handle edge cases where `k` is greater than the total number of positions that can be covered by the scoop-net. In such cases, the function should return the maximum possible expected value, but the code does not account for this scenario.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be revised to accurately calculate the coverage area, update the coverage values after each fish is added, and handle edge cases where `k` is greater than the total number of positions that can be covered by the scoop-net.

For example, given the input `n = 3, m = 3, r = 2, k = 3`, the code should output `2.0000000000`, but it may not do so due to the incorrect calculation of the coverage area. 

In addition,  the provided code has a few potential issues, for instance it uses `n`, `m`, and `r` as global variables in the `coverage` function, which could lead to bugs if the function is used elsewhere in the code. The code also does not check if `k` is less than or equal to `n * m`, which could lead to an error if `k` is greater than the total number of cells in the grid. However, as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid, so these issues are not considered in the correctness assessment. 

However, considering that `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` will always be valid, the main issue with the code is that it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the number of caught fishes, which makes the code incorrect according to the problem description.
