You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the provided program is that the function `coverage(x, y)` is not properly defined within the scope of `func_1(n, m, r, k)`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are used within `coverage(x, y)`, but they are not defined as global variables or passed as arguments to this function. This would raise a `NameError` when attempting to execute the `coverage(x, y)` function.

To fix this issue, the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` should be passed as arguments to the `coverage(x, y)` function. Here's an example of how the corrected code might look:

```python
import heapq
import sys

def coverage(x, y, n, m, r):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))

def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y, n, m, r), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
```

Another potential issue with the program is that it assumes the `coverage(x, y)` function correctly calculates the coverage area for a given cell `(x, y)`. However, the formula used in the `coverage(x, y)` function seems to be incorrect. It does not accurately represent the number of scoop-net positions that would cover the cell `(x, y)`.

A correct implementation of the `coverage(x, y)` function would need to take into account the size of the scoop-net (`r`) and the dimensions of the pond (`n` and `m`). The correct formula for calculating the coverage area would depend on the position of the cell `(x, y)` within the pond and the size of the scoop-net.

Without a correct implementation of the `coverage(x, y)` function, the program cannot accurately calculate the expected number of caught fishes. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function calculates and returns the area that a scoop-net of size `r` can cover around a given position `(x, y)` in an `n` by `m` grid, taking into account the grid boundaries. The function accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `x` and `y` are integers representing cell positions, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. However, it appears that `n`, `m`, and `r` are not explicitly defined as parameters in the function, suggesting that they are assumed to be globally defined or accessed in some manner not shown in the provided code snippet. The function considers edge cases where the scoop-net's area exceeds the grid boundaries, adjusting the covered area accordingly. The returned value represents the maximum area that the scoop-net can cover without exceeding the grid's limits, providing a measure of the accessible region around the specified position.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
