You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangular pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the square scoop such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and k is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be released such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions.
    #
    #The outer loop code is:
    #```python
    #for x in range(n):
    #```
    #The inner loop code is:
    #```python
    #for y in range(m):
    #    heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    #```
    #
    #Given:
    #- `n` is a positive integer.
    #- `m` is a positive integer.
    #- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
    #- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
    #- `heap` is an empty list.
    #
    #After each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates `m` times, pushing a new tuple onto the heap at each iteration. The tuple contains `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. 
    #
    #After all iterations of the outer loop, the `heap` list will contain `n` × `m` tuples:
    #1. `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`
    #2. `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`
    #...
    #`m`. `(-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1)`
    #...
    #`n` × `m`. `(-coverage(n-1, m-1), n-1, m-1)`
    #
    #The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. The only change is in the `heap` list, which now contains `n` × `m` tuples.
    #
    #The value of `x` after the loop finishes is `n-1`, as it is the last value assigned to `x` in the outer loop. The value of `y` after the loop finishes is `m-1`, as it is the last value assigned to `y` in the inner loop.
    #
    #If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given that `n` and `m` are positive integers), the `heap` list would remain empty, and the values of `x` and `y` would be unchanged.
    #
    #Therefore, the Output State is:
    #**`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is `n-1`**
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, except for the `k` tuples with the highest coverage values, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the `k`-th highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the `k`-th highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated `k`-th highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the sum of the `k` highest `coverage(x, y)` values from the initial `heap`. If `k` is 0, then `total_coverage` is 0 and `heap` remains unchanged.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average of the k highest coverage values across all possible positions in a grid of size n by m, with a window size of r by r, where k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5), and the average is calculated as the sum of the k highest coverage values divided by the total number of positions (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing cell positions in a 2D grid, n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area that a scoop-net of size r can cover around position (x, y) in an n by m grid, considering the grid boundaries.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
