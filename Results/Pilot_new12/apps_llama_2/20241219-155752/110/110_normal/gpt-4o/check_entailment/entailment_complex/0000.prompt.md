You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangular pond, r is a positive integer representing the size of the square scoop such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and k is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be released such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions.
    #
    #The outer loop code is:
    #```python
    #for x in range(n):
    #```
    #The inner loop code is:
    #```python
    #for y in range(m):
    #    heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    #```
    #
    #Given:
    #- `n` is a positive integer.
    #- `m` is a positive integer.
    #- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
    #- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
    #- `heap` is an empty list.
    #
    #After each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates `m` times, pushing a new tuple onto the heap at each iteration. The tuple contains `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. 
    #
    #After all iterations of the outer loop, the `heap` list will contain `n` × `m` tuples:
    #1. `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`
    #2. `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`
    #...
    #`m`. `(-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1)`
    #...
    #`n` × `m`. `(-coverage(n-1, m-1), n-1, m-1)`
    #
    #The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. The only change is in the `heap` list, which now contains `n` × `m` tuples.
    #
    #The value of `x` after the loop finishes is `n-1`, as it is the last value assigned to `x` in the outer loop. The value of `y` after the loop finishes is `m-1`, as it is the last value assigned to `y` in the inner loop.
    #
    #If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given that `n` and `m` are positive integers), the `heap` list would remain empty, and the values of `x` and `y` would be unchanged.
    #
    #Therefore, the Output State is:
    #**`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is `n-1`**
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, except for the `k` tuples with the highest coverage values, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the `k`-th highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the `k`-th highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated `k`-th highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the sum of the `k` highest `coverage(x, y)` values from the initial `heap`. If `k` is 0, then `total_coverage` is 0 and `heap` remains unchanged.
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the average of the k highest coverage values across all possible positions in a grid of size n by m, with a window size of r by r, where k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5), and the average is calculated as the sum of the k highest coverage values divided by the total number of positions (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the average of the k highest coverage values across all possible positions in a rectangular grid of size n by m, with a window size of r by r, where k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5). The function first creates a heap of tuples containing the negative coverage values and their corresponding positions, then pops the k highest coverage values from the heap, and finally calculates the average by dividing the sum of these coverage values by the total number of positions (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1). The function handles potential edge cases such as when k is 0, in which case the function returns 0, and when k is equal to the total number of positions, in which case the function returns the average of all coverage values. However, the function does not handle cases where n, m, r, or k are not positive integers or where r is greater than min(n, m), and it assumes that the coverage function is defined and returns a valid value. Additionally, the function does not modify the input parameters n, m, r, or k, and it does not have any side effects.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing cell positions in a 2D grid, n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and r is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area that a scoop-net of size r can cover around position (x, y) in an n by m grid, considering the grid boundaries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the area that a scoop-net of size `r` can cover around a given position `(x, y)` in an `n` by `m` grid, taking into account the grid boundaries. The function accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `x` and `y` are integers representing cell positions, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. However, it appears that `n`, `m`, and `r` are not explicitly defined as parameters in the function, suggesting that they are assumed to be globally defined or accessed in some manner not shown in the provided code snippet. The function considers edge cases where the scoop-net's area exceeds the grid boundaries, adjusting the covered area accordingly. The returned value represents the maximum area that the scoop-net can cover without exceeding the grid's limits, providing a measure of the accessible region around the specified position.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
