Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes when Misha releases k fishes into a rectangular pond of size n × m and uses a square scoop of size r × r to catch them. The code appears to do what the problem description says for every potential case.

The function `func_1` calculates the average of the k highest coverage values across all possible positions in the grid, which represents the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. The `coverage` function accurately calculates the area that a scoop-net of size `r` can cover around a given position `(x, y)` in the grid.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the functionality of the `func_1` and `coverage` functions. The code handles potential edge cases such as when k is 0 or when k is equal to the total number of positions. The program also correctly handles cases where n, m, r, or k are positive integers and where r is not greater than min(n, m).

The program description provides examples, such as the 3x3 grid with a 2x2 scoop and 3 fishes, which the program correctly handles. The output of the program for this example is 2.0000000000, which matches the expected output.

The program description also mentions that the answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-9. The program's output is printed to 10 decimal places, ensuring that the answer is accurate enough to meet this requirement.

Since the code appears to correctly implement the problem description and handles all potential cases, the Correctness is **True**.
