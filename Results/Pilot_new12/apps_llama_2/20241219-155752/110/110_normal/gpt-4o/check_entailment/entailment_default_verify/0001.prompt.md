You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False** 

The given program attempts to calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes by releasing k fishes into a rectangular pond of size n × m, with a square scoop of size r × r. However, there are several issues with the program:

1.  The program doesn't correctly implement the `coverage` function. The current implementation tries to calculate the number of possible positions where a fish at (x, y) can be caught by the scoop, but it does so incorrectly.

2.  The program doesn't handle the case when k is greater than the total number of possible positions in the pond. In such cases, the program should place fishes in all possible positions and then distribute the remaining fishes evenly among the positions.

3.  The program doesn't correctly calculate the total coverage. The current implementation uses a heap to prioritize positions based on their coverage, but it doesn't account for the fact that placing a fish at a position can affect the coverage of other positions.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: 3 3 2 3

In this case, the program should place fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. However, the program's implementation of the `coverage` function and the calculation of the total coverage are incorrect, which can lead to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to implement a strategy that places fishes in positions where they are most likely to be caught by the scoop. One possible approach is to prioritize positions based on their visibility to the scoop, which can be calculated by iterating over all possible positions of the scoop and counting the number of times each cell is covered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    # Initialize a 2D array to store the visibility of each cell
    visibility = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]

    # Calculate the visibility of each cell
    for x in range(n - r + 1):
        for y in range(m - r + 1):
            for i in range(r):
                for j in range(r):
                    visibility[x + i][y + j] += 1

    # Place fishes in the most visible positions
    fishes = []
    for _ in range(k):
        max_visibility = 0
        max_position = None
        for x in range(n):
            for y in range(m):
                if visibility[x][y] > max_visibility:
                    max_visibility = visibility[x][y]
                    max_position = (x, y)
        fishes.append(max_position)
        visibility[max_position[0]][max_position[1]] = 0

    # Calculate the expected number of caught fishes
    expected_value = 0
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    for x in range(n - r + 1):
        for y in range(m - r + 1):
            count = 0
            for i in range(r):
                for j in range(r):
                    if (x + i, y + j) in fishes:
                        count += 1
            expected_value += count

    return expected_value / total_positions
```

This corrected program calculates the visibility of each cell by iterating over all possible positions of the scoop and counting the number of times each cell is covered. It then places fishes in the most visible positions and calculates the expected number of caught fishes by iterating over all possible positions of the scoop and counting the number of fishes that would be caught in each position.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function calculates and returns the area that a scoop-net of size `r` can cover around a given position `(x, y)` in an `n` by `m` grid, taking into account the grid boundaries. The function accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `x` and `y` are integers representing cell positions, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. However, it appears that `n`, `m`, and `r` are not explicitly defined as parameters in the function, suggesting that they are assumed to be globally defined or accessed in some manner not shown in the provided code snippet. The function considers edge cases where the scoop-net's area exceeds the grid boundaries, adjusting the covered area accordingly. The returned value represents the maximum area that the scoop-net can cover without exceeding the grid's limits, providing a measure of the accessible region around the specified position.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
