To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer and `m` must be greater than 1.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
- `heap` is a list containing a tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

This line of code pushes a new element onto the heap. The element is a tuple containing `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the tuple becomes `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`.

The `coverage` function is not defined in the provided information, so we will treat `coverage(0, 1)` as a specific, unknown value for the purpose of this explanation. Let's denote this value as `C`, where `C = coverage(0, 1)`.

After executing the code, the heap will contain two elements: 
1. The original tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`.
2. The new tuple `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`.

The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not changed by this operation. The only change is in the `heap` list, which now contains an additional tuple.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)` and `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
