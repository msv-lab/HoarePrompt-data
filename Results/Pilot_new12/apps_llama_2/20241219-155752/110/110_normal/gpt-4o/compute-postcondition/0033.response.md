According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If the current iteration count is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5). So for the loop to be executed one more time, the iteration count must be less than `k`. Since the loop has already executed once, the iteration count is 1. For the loop to execute again, the iteration count is still less than `k` because `k` is at least 2. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the two tuples with the highest and next highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap` - (the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`), iteration count is 1**
