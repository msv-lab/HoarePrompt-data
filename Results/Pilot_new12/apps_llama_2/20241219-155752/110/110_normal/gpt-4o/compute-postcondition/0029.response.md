The variable `total_coverage` is updated by subtracting `cov` from it. The initial value of `total_coverage` is 0, and `cov` equals the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`. Therefore, `total_coverage` becomes 0 minus the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value, which simplifies to the highest `coverage(x, y)` value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5) and `k` is at least 1, `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the tuple with the highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`**
