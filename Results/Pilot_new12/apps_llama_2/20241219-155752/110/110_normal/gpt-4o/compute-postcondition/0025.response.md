To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions.

The outer loop code is:
```python
for x in range(n):
```
The inner loop code is:
```python
for y in range(m):
    heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
- `heap` is an empty list.

After each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates `m` times, pushing a new tuple onto the heap at each iteration. The tuple contains `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. 

After all iterations of the outer loop, the `heap` list will contain `n` × `m` tuples:
1. `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`
2. `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`
...
`m`. `(-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1)`
...
`n` × `m`. `(-coverage(n-1, m-1), n-1, m-1)`

The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. The only change is in the `heap` list, which now contains `n` × `m` tuples.

The value of `x` after the loop finishes is `n-1`, as it is the last value assigned to `x` in the outer loop. The value of `y` after the loop finishes is `m-1`, as it is the last value assigned to `y` in the inner loop.

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given that `n` and `m` are positive integers), the `heap` list would remain empty, and the values of `x` and `y` would be unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is `n-1`**
