According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to potentially execute more than two times, but for the loop to execute one more time `m` just needs to be greater than 1, and since `y` is 2 now, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time at `y` equals 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples, `x` is 1, `y` is 2**
