The value of `total_coverage` is decreased by `cov`, which equals the negated third highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`. Therefore, the new value of `total_coverage` is the old value of `total_coverage` minus `cov`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the three tuples with the highest, next highest, and third highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the third highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the third highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated third highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap` - (the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`) - `cov`, iteration count is 1**
