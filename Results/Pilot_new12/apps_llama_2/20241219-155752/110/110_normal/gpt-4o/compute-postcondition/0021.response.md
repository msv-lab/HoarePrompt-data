The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` adds a new tuple to the `heap` list. Given the initial state, `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, so the tuple `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)` is added to the `heap`. 

The `heap` initially contains tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, tuples `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, and the tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`. After adding the new tuple, the `heap` will contain all these initial tuples plus the new tuple `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, and `x` and `y` do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and additional tuples `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and the tuples `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)` and `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1**
