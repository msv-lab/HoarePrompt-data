To calculate the result, we follow the code step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
- `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`.
- `x` is `n-1`.

The new variable is introduced: `total_coverage` which is initialized to `0`.

Since the value of `total_coverage` is explicitly set to `0`, it does not depend on the previous values of other variables.

The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `heap`, and `x` are not changed by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is `n-1`, `total_coverage` is 0**
