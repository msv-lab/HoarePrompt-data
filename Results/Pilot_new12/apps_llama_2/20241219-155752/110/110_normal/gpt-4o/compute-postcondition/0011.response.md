To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we need to understand what the code does and how it affects the variables.

The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple onto the heap. This tuple contains three elements: `-coverage(x, y)`, `x`, and `y`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`)
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5)
- `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 0

The `coverage(x, y)` function is not defined in the given problem, so we'll treat its result as a variable value dependent on `x` and `y`.

After executing `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))`:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `heap` now contains an additional tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` because `x` is 1 and `y` is 0. The heap is updated to maintain the heap property.
- `x` remains 1.
- `y` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is that all variables maintain their initial values except for `heap`, which now includes an additional tuple based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and an additional tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0**
