The function `coverage` accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`. `x` and `y` are integers representing cell positions in a 2D grid, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the scoop-net. After executing the function body, the function returns the area that a scoop-net of size `r` can cover around position (`x`, `y`) in an `n` by `m` grid, considering the grid boundaries.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, n, m, and r, and returns the area that a scoop-net of size r can cover around position (x, y) in an n by m grid.**
