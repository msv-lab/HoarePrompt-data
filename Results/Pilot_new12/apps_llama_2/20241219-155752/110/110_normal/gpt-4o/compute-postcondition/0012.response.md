According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be incremented by 1, so `y` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and an additional tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
