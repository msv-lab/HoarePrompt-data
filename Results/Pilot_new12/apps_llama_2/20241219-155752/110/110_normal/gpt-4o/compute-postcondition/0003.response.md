The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` onto the `heap` list, where `coverage(x, y)` is a function that we don't have the definition for. Given the initial state that `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and other variables are as described, the function `coverage(x, y)` will be evaluated with `x=0` and `y=0`. However, without knowing the definition of `coverage(x, y)`, we can only denote its result as `coverage(0, 0)`.

After executing the code, the `heap` list, which was initially empty, will now contain a tuple with the value `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`. The negative sign is used to simulate a max heap since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min heap implementation.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing a tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
