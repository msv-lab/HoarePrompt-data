To calculate the result, let's first understand what the code does. The `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` line adds a new tuple to the `heap` list. The tuple contains the negative of the `coverage(x, y)` value, and the values of `x` and `y`. 

Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the new tuple will be `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`. The `heap` now contains three tuples: `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, and `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The constraints on `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and `m` must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`, and `(-coverage(0, 2), 0, 2)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 2**
