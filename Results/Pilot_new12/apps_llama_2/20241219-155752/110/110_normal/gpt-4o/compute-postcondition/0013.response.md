The `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` line of code pushes a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` into the `heap` list. Given that `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, the tuple `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)` is added to the `heap`. The `heap` initially contains tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and an additional tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`. 

After the execution of the code, the `heap` will contain the initial tuples plus the new tuple `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, an additional tuple `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, and a new tuple `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, and `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
