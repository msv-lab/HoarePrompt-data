The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangular pond. `r` is a positive integer representing the size of the square scoop, where `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`. `k` is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be released, where `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)`. 

After executing the function body, the function returns the average of the `k` highest coverage values across all possible positions in a grid of size `n` by `m`, with a window size of `r` by `r`. The average is calculated as the sum of the `k` highest coverage values divided by `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the dimensions of a rectangular pond `n` and `m`, the size of a square scoop `r`, and the number of fishes to be released `k`, and return the average of the `k` highest coverage values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, and returns the average of the k highest coverage values across all possible positions in a grid of size n by m, with a window size of r by r.**
