The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` adds a new tuple to the `heap` list. Given the initial state, `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, so the tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)` is added to the `heap`. 

The `heap` initially contains tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and additional tuples `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`. After the execution, it will also contain the tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not changed by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and additional tuples `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and the tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 0**
