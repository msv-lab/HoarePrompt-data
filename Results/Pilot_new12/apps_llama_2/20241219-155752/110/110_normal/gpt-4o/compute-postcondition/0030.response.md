According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the tuple with the highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`**
