To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the current conditions.

The loop code is:
```python
for x in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
- `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`.
- `x` is 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` is 1.

Since `x` has been incremented, the `heap` list will be modified in the next iteration. The loop will push new tuples onto the heap, with `x` being 1.

The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is 1**
