According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing a tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
