To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`)
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5) and `k` is at least 1
- `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`
- `x` is `n-1`
- `total_coverage` is 0

The code is:
```python
cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
```

The impact of the code on the program:
- `heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `heap` list. Given that `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, the smallest element will be the one with the highest `coverage(x, y)` value because the `coverage(x, y)` is negated in the tuple.
- The returned smallest element's values are then unpacked into `cov`, `x`, and `y`.

After executing the code:
- The `heap` list will have one less element, specifically the one with the highest `coverage(x, y)` value.
- `cov` will be assigned the negated value of the highest `coverage(x, y)` from the `heap`, so `cov` equals `-coverage(x, y)` where `(x, y)` is the pair with the highest coverage.
- `x` and `y` will be assigned the `x` and `y` values of the tuple that was removed from the `heap`, which corresponds to the highest `coverage(x, y)`.

Given the initial state of `x` being `n-1` and being updated by the code, the new value of `x` will be the `x` from the tuple with the highest coverage in the `heap`.

Other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `total_coverage`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`)
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5) and `k` is at least 1
- `heap` contains one less tuple than initially, specifically missing the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` value
- `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`
- `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`
- `cov` equals the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`
- `total_coverage` is 0

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5) and `k` is at least 1, `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the tuple with the highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` is 0**
