To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer, 
- `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, 
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), 
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), 
- `heap` is a list containing tuples, 
- `x` is 1, 
- `y` is 2.

The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a tuple onto the heap. This tuple contains three elements: 
- The negative of the result of the function `coverage(x, y)`, 
- The value of `x`, 
- The value of `y`.

Since `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, the tuple pushed onto the heap is `(-coverage(1, 2), 1, 2)`.

The function `coverage(x, y)` is not defined in the problem, so we cannot determine its return value. Let's denote the result of `coverage(1, 2)` as `coverage_result`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is:
- `n` is still a positive integer, 
- `m` is still a positive integer and must be greater than 2, 
- `r` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), 
- `k` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), 
- `heap` is a list containing tuples, including the new tuple `(-coverage_result, 1, 2)`, 
- `x` is still 1, 
- `y` is still 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples including `(-coverage(1, 2), 1, 2)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 2**
