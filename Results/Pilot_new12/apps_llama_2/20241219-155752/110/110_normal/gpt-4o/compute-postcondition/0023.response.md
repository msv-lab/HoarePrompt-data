To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given Python code on the variables and their initial conditions.

The given code snippet is: `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))`

From the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
- `heap` is a list containing tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and additional tuples `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` and the tuples `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)` and `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)` and possibly more.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 2.

The code pushes a new tuple onto the heap: `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, the tuple becomes `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`.

Thus, after executing this line of code, the `heap` will contain all its original tuples plus this new tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, `y`) do not change because of this operation.

Therefore, the output state, given the initial conditions and the executed code, is:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2.
- `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5).
- `heap` is a list containing its original tuples plus the additional tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(0, y), 0, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, tuples `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1`, tuples `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)` and `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)` and possibly more, plus the tuple `(-coverage(2, 2), 2, 2)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 2**
