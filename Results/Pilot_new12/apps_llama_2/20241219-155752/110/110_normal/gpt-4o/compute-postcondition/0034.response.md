The `heapq.heappop(heap)` function call removes and returns the tuple with the smallest first element (i.e., the one with the highest `coverage(x, y)` value since the coverage values are negated) from the `heap`. 

The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` are updated to be equal to the negated `coverage(x, y)` value, `x` value, and `y` value from the tuple that was removed from the `heap`. 

Given the initial state that `x` and `y` were the `x` and `y` values from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap` and `cov` was the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, now `x`, `y`, and `cov` are updated to be the `x`, `y`, and negated `coverage(x, y)` values from the tuple that was removed from the `heap`. This tuple has the highest `coverage(x, y)` value in the `heap` after the initial two tuples were removed, which is the highest `coverage(x, y)` value in the initial `heap`.

Since the first two tuples with the highest and next highest coverage values were already removed from the `heap` before the given initial state, now `x`, `y`, and `cov` are the `x`, `y`, and negated `coverage(x, y)` values from the tuple that has the third highest `coverage(x, y)` value in the initial `heap`. 

The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the three tuples with the highest, next highest, and third highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the third highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the third highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated third highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap` - (the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`), iteration count is 1**
