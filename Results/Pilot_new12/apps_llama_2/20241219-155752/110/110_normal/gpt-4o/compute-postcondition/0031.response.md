The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of the tuple with the next highest coverage (after the initial highest) from the `heap`. The `heap` is also updated by removing the popped tuple. 

The value of `n` remains a positive integer, the value of `m` remains a positive integer, the value of `r` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), the value of `k` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), and `total_coverage` remains the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`. 

Note that the initial `x` and `y` were the `x` and `y` values from the tuple with the highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, and the initial `cov` was the negated highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`. 

After executing the given code, `cov` becomes the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `x` becomes the `x` value from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` becomes the `y` value from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`·`m`, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` except the two tuples with the highest and next highest coverage, `x` equals the `x` value from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `y` equals the `y` value from the tuple with the next highest `coverage(x, y)` in the initial `heap`, `cov` equals the negated next highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`, `total_coverage` equals the highest `coverage(x, y)` value from the initial `heap`.**
