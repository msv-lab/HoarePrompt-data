Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the expected value of the number of caught fishes. The program simply calculates the minimum between `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net, and then divides it by the number of possible positions. However, this approach does not take into account the optimal placement of fishes in the pond to maximize the expected value.

A counterexample is the input `3 3 2 1`. The program will output `1.0 / 4.0 = 0.25`, which is incorrect. The optimal placement of the fish is at position `(2, 2)`, which results in an expected value of `1.0 / 4.0 * 4 = 1.0` because the fish will be caught in all four possible positions of the scoop-net.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the optimal placement of fishes in the pond, which involves a more complex calculation than what is provided in the given program. 

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of caught fishes for all possible inputs, and therefore, its correctness is **False**. 

The correct solution involves calculating the number of ways to place `k` fishes in the pond such that the expected value of caught fishes is maximized. This can be achieved by placing the fishes in a way that they are caught in the maximum number of possible positions of the scoop-net. 

One way to achieve this is by placing the fishes in a grid pattern, where each fish is placed at a distance of `r` from the previous fish. This ensures that each fish is caught in the maximum number of possible positions of the scoop-net, and the expected value is maximized. 

The correct calculation of the expected value involves counting the number of ways to place the fishes in the pond and then dividing it by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net. 

The given program does not perform this calculation correctly, and therefore, it produces incorrect results for some inputs.
