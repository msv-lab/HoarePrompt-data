Correctness: **False**

The code does not consider the optimal placement of fish in the pond to maximize the expected number of caught fish. It simply calculates the ratio of the minimum between k and the number of possible sub-grids to the total number of possible sub-grids.

The problem description asks to maximize the expected number of caught fish, which means we need to strategically place the fish in the pond to get the maximum average. The code does not take this into account.

For example, if we have a 3x3 pond with a 2x2 scoop and 3 fish, the code will output 1.0, but the correct answer is 2.0, which can be achieved by placing the fish in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).

The code does not handle the case where k is greater than the number of possible sub-grids, and it does not consider the size of the scoop and the pond. It simply calculates a ratio that does not represent the expected number of caught fish.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the number of times each cell is covered by the scoop and place the fish in the cells with the highest coverage. The code does not do this, so it is incorrect.
