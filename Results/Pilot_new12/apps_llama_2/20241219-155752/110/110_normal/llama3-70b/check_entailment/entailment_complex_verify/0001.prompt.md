You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the expected value of the number of caught fishes. The program simply calculates the minimum between `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net, and then divides it by the number of possible positions. However, this approach does not take into account the optimal placement of fishes in the pond to maximize the expected value.

A counterexample is the input `3 3 2 1`. The program will output `1.0 / 4.0 = 0.25`, which is incorrect. The optimal placement of the fish is at position `(2, 2)`, which results in an expected value of `1.0 / 4.0 * 4 = 1.0` because the fish will be caught in all four possible positions of the scoop-net.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the optimal placement of fishes in the pond, which involves a more complex calculation than what is provided in the given program. 

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of caught fishes for all possible inputs, and therefore, its correctness is **False**. 

The correct solution involves calculating the number of ways to place `k` fishes in the pond such that the expected value of caught fishes is maximized. This can be achieved by placing the fishes in a way that they are caught in the maximum number of possible positions of the scoop-net. 

One way to achieve this is by placing the fishes in a grid pattern, where each fish is placed at a distance of `r` from the previous fish. This ensures that each fish is caught in the maximum number of possible positions of the scoop-net, and the expected value is maximized. 

The correct calculation of the expected value involves counting the number of ways to place the fishes in the pond and then dividing it by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net. 

The given program does not perform this calculation correctly, and therefore, it produces incorrect results for some inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, r, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5).
def func():
    n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four positive integers n, m, r, and k as input, with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5), and then calculates and prints the ratio of the minimum between k and the number of possible sub-grids (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) to the total number of possible sub-grids (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1). The function does not explicitly return a value, instead, it prints the calculated ratio, effectively providing a fraction that represents the proportion of the limited resource k to the total possible sub-grids, given the constraints of n, m, and r. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has output the calculated ratio to the user, with no further modifications to the input variables or any other state changes, except for the printed output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
