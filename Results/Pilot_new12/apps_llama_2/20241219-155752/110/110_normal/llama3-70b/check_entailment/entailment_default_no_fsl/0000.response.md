Correctness: **False**

The given code does not solve the problem correctly. The problem asks to find the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) possible positions. However, the code simply calculates the minimum between k and the number of possible sub-grids, and then divides it by the total number of possible sub-grids.

The code does not consider the optimal placement of fishes in the pond to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. For example, in the case where n = 3, m = 3, r = 2, and k = 3, the code will output 1.0, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 2.0, which can be achieved by placing the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), as shown in the problem description.

The code also does not handle the case where k is larger than the number of possible sub-grids. In such cases, the code will simply output 1.0, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes, which can be achieved by placing the fishes in the most optimal way possible.

Therefore, the given code does not solve the problem correctly, and its correctness is **False**.
