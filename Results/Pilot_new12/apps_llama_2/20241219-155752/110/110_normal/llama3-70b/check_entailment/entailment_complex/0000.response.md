Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among `(n - r + 1)Â·(m - r + 1)` possible positions, given that `k` fishes are released into the empty pond.

The program, however, simply calculates and prints the ratio of the minimum between `k` and the number of possible sub-grids `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)` to the total number of possible sub-grids `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This does not represent the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

To solve the problem as described, the program should release `k` fishes into the most densely packed area of the pond that can be covered by the scoop-net, which would typically be along the bottom or left edge of the pond, or scattered in such a way to maximize the expected number of catches given the constraints of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.

Here's a simple counterexample to demonstrate that the provided program is incorrect:

Suppose `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`. The program would output `2.0`, which is not the expected maximum number of caught fishes given the constraints.

The correct approach would be to consider the placement of the `k` fishes to maximize the expected number of catches, which could involve distributing them evenly or densely packing them in a way that the scoop-net would be most likely to catch them. The provided program does not consider the placement strategy for maximizing the expected number of catches and thus does not solve the problem as described. 

To provide the correct solution, we need to consider that the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes is achieved when the fishes are distributed in a pattern that maximizes the number of catches given the constraints. 

For example, the problem description gives an example where the input is `3 3 2 3` and the output is `2.0000000000`. This can be achieved by placing the `3` fishes in the grid such that any placement of the scoop-net will catch `2` fishes. 

So, for `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, and `k = 3`, placing the fishes in cells `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)` would catch `2` fishes for any placement of the scoop-net, giving an expected value of `2.0`.

To solve this problem in general, the approach would involve distributing the `k` fishes in the most densely packed area of the pond that can be covered by the scoop-net, such as along the bottom or left edge of the pond, or scattered in such a way to maximize the expected number of catches given the constraints of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.

Here's an example of a correct Python solution:
```python
def func():
    n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())
    expect = 0
    # release k fishes into the most densely packed area
    for i in range(k):
        x, y = i // m, i % m
        if x >= n:
            break
        if x + r <= n and y + r <= m:
            expect += (r * r)
        else:
            # calculate the area covered by the scoop-net
            area_x = min(r, n - x)
            area_y = min(r, m - y)
            expect += (area_x * area_y)
    total_area = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    expect /= total_area
    print(expect)
```
This program calculates the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes by distributing the `k` fishes in the most densely packed area of the pond that can be covered by the scoop-net and then calculates the expected value based on the total number of possible positions for the scoop-net. The output of the program is the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.
