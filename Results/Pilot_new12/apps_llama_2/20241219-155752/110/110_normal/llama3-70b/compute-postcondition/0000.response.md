The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The `input()` function accepts a string of space-separated integers, and `map(int, input().split())` converts each integer string to an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are then assigned the values from this map object.

The initial state constraints that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5) are still valid, but the specific values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are updated to the input values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5), and their values are equal to the input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5), and their values are equal to the input values**
