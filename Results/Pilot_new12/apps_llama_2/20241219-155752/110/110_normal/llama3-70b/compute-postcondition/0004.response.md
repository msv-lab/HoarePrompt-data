Functionality: **The function accepts four positive integers n, m, r, and k as input, with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, 1 <= r <= min(n, m), and 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^5), and then calculates and prints the ratio of the minimum between k and the number of possible sub-grids (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) to the total number of possible sub-grids (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1). The function does not explicitly return a value, instead, it prints the calculated ratio, effectively providing a fraction that represents the proportion of the limited resource k to the total possible sub-grids, given the constraints of n, m, and r. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has output the calculated ratio to the user, with no further modifications to the input variables or any other state changes, except for the printed output.**
