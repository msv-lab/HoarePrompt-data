The function accepts input in the form of two lines: the first line containing an integer n, and the second line containing n integers representing the elements of array A. It calculates the prefix sum of the array and checks if the total sum is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of triples (k, l, r) where k is the index of the subarray, l is the starting index of the subarray, and r is the ending index of the subarray, such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is not equal to zero and not equal to the total sum, and finally prints the triple (k, l, n) representing the last subarray. The function handles all potential edge cases, including arrays with a single element, arrays with all elements as zero, and arrays with a mix of positive and negative numbers. If the input array has a total sum of zero, the function only prints 'NO'. If the input array has a non-zero total sum, the function prints 'YES' followed by the specified triples, which may include duplicate or overlapping subarrays if the prefix sum at any index is not equal to zero and not equal to the total sum. The function does not perform any error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer inputs or arrays with more or fewer elements than specified by the input integer n.
