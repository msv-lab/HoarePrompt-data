You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way it prints the subarrays. Instead of printing the correct format with the number of subarrays followed by the subarray indices, it attempts to print the subarray indices along with the subarray count.

A specific case that the program does not handle correctly is the output format. According to the problem description, the output should be in the following format:
```
YES
k
l1 r1
l2 r2
...
lk rk
```
However, the given program prints:
```
YES
k l r
```
which is not the correct format.

Another issue is that the program does not reset the `k` variable before printing the subarray indices. As a result, the subarray count is printed along with each subarray index, leading to incorrect output.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to print the correct output format, and the `k` variable should be reset before printing the subarray indices. 

Here is an example of how the correct output should look:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        l = 1
        result = []
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                result.append((l, r))
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        if sum(a[l-1:])!= 0:
            result.append((l, n))
            k += 1
        print(k)
        for l, r in result:
            print(l, r)
```
This corrected program should produce the expected output for all test cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input will contain two lines. The first line is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of elements in the array A. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (-10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3), representing the elements of the array A.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n-1`.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1 plus the number of `r` values for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or 1 if no such `r` exists.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1 plus the number of `r` values for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or 1 if no such `r` exists, and the values of `k`, `l`, `n` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input in the form of two lines: the first line containing an integer n, and the second line containing n integers representing the elements of array A. It calculates the prefix sum of the array and checks if the total sum is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a series of triples (k, l, r) where k is the index of the subarray, l is the starting index of the subarray, and r is the ending index of the subarray, such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is not equal to zero and not equal to the total sum, and finally prints the triple (k, l, n) representing the last subarray. The function handles all potential edge cases, including arrays with a single element, arrays with all elements as zero, and arrays with a mix of positive and negative numbers. If the input array has a total sum of zero, the function only prints 'NO'. If the input array has a non-zero total sum, the function prints 'YES' followed by the specified triples, which may include duplicate or overlapping subarrays if the prefix sum at any index is not equal to zero and not equal to the total sum. The function does not perform any error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer inputs or arrays with more or fewer elements than specified by the input integer n.
