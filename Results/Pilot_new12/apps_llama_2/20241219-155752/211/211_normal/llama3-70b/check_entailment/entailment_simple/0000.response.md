Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

One issue with the program is that it does not correctly print the number of new arrays. In the problem description, it is specified that after printing "YES", the program should print the number of new arrays (denoted by 'k') on a separate line. However, in the program, the value of 'k' is printed along with the left and right indices of the subarray.

Another issue is that the program prints the subarray indices incorrectly. The problem description requires that the first line after "YES" should contain the number of new arrays 'k', and then each of the next 'k' lines should contain two integers l_i and r_i denoting the subarray A[l_i... r_i]. However, the program does not follow this format. Instead, it prints the value of 'k' along with the left and right indices of the subarray.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        result = []
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                result.append((l, r))
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        result.append((l, n))
        print(k)
        for l, r in result:
            print(l, r)

func()
```
In this corrected version, the program first constructs a list of tuples representing the subarrays. Then, it prints the number of new arrays 'k', followed by the left and right indices of each subarray. This corrected program follows the format specified in the problem description.
