Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the program prints the subarrays. According to the problem description, the program should print the number of subarrays `k`, followed by `k` lines, each containing the start and end indices of a subarray. However, the program prints a series of triples `(k, l, r)` where `k` is not necessarily the number of subarrays.

In the code, the line `print(k, l, r)` is incorrect because it prints the value of `k` which is the index of the subarray, but it should only print the start and end indices of the subarray. Moreover, the line `print(k, l, n)` is also incorrect because it should only print the start and end indices of the last subarray.

The correct code should be modified to print the number of subarrays `k` first, and then print the start and end indices of each subarray on a separate line. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]

    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        result = []
        start = 0
        for end in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[end]!= 0 and prefix_sum[end]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                result.append((start + 1, end))
                start = end
        result.append((start + 1, n))
        print(len(result))
        for start, end in result:
            print(start, end)
```

This corrected code follows the problem description and prints the correct output.
