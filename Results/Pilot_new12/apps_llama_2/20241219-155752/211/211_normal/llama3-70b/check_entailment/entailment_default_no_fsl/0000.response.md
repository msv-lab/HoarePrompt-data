Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. The main issue lies in the printing of the subarray indices. The code prints the index `k` along with the subarray indices `l` and `r`, which is not as per the problem description. The problem description requires printing the number of subarrays `k` on a separate line, followed by the subarray indices `l` and `r` for each subarray.

Another issue is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the total sum is not zero, but the prefix sum at some index is equal to the total sum. In such cases, the code will not print the correct subarray indices.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 -6
```
The total sum is 0, but the prefix sum at index 3 is not zero, and the prefix sum at index 4 is zero. The code will print 'YES' followed by incorrect subarray indices.

A correct implementation would involve printing the number of subarrays `k` on a separate line, followed by the subarray indices `l` and `r` for each subarray, and handling the case when the prefix sum at some index is equal to the total sum correctly.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        result = []
        l = 0
        for r in range(n):
            if prefix_sum[r + 1]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r + 1]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                result.append((l + 1, r + 1))
                l = r + 1
        if prefix_sum[n]!= 0:
            result.append((l + 1, n))
        print(len(result))
        for l, r in result:
            print(l, r)
```
