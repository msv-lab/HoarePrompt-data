Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way it prints the subarrays. Instead of printing the correct format with the number of subarrays followed by the subarray indices, it attempts to print the subarray indices along with the subarray count.

A specific case that the program does not handle correctly is the output format. According to the problem description, the output should be in the following format:
```
YES
k
l1 r1
l2 r2
...
lk rk
```
However, the given program prints:
```
YES
k l r
```
which is not the correct format.

Another issue is that the program does not reset the `k` variable before printing the subarray indices. As a result, the subarray count is printed along with each subarray index, leading to incorrect output.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to print the correct output format, and the `k` variable should be reset before printing the subarray indices. 

Here is an example of how the correct output should look:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        l = 1
        result = []
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                result.append((l, r))
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        if sum(a[l-1:])!= 0:
            result.append((l, n))
            k += 1
        print(k)
        for l, r in result:
            print(l, r)
```
This corrected program should produce the expected output for all test cases.
