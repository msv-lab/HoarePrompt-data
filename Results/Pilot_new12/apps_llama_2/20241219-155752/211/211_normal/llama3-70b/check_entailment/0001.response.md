Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when the sum of the subarray from the current position to the end of the array is zero. 

For example, if we input:
```
4
1 2 -3 0
```
The program will output:
```
YES
2 1 2
2 3 4
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 4
```
But actually, the program outputs an extra number before the subarray indices because the program is incorrectly printing the number of subarrays (k) before the subarray indices.

But actually, the main problem is the last line where the program prints the last subarray, it is printing `k` instead of `k-1`, so the indices and the number of subarray are not correctly printed.

Here is the corrected version of the last print statement:
```python
print(k-1, l, n)
```
But still, there is a problem with how `k` is being printed with each subarray. 

To fix the code, we need to modify it to only print the number of subarrays once, after the "YES" statement, and to print the subarray indices without the extra `k`. 

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 0
        l = 1
        subarrays = []
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                subarrays.append((l, r))
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
        print(k)
        for subarray in subarrays:
            print(*subarray)

func()
```
