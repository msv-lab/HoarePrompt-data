Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is with the output format. According to the problem description, the output should be in the following format:

```
YES
k
l1 r1
l2 r2
...
lk rk
```

However, the code prints the output in a different format:

```
YES
k, l, r
k, l, n
```

Another issue is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the input array has a total sum of non-zero, but all the subarrays have a sum of zero. In this case, the code should print 'NO', but the code does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is:

```
4
0 0 0 1
```

The code prints:

```
YES
1, 1, 3
2, 4, 4
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
YES
1
1 3
4 4
```

Also, the code does not correctly calculate the number of subarrays (k). The code simply increments k whenever it finds a non-zero prefix sum, but this is not the correct way to calculate k.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to correctly calculate the number of subarrays and to print the output in the correct format. 

Additionally, the code should handle the edge cases correctly, such as arrays with a single element, arrays with all elements as zero, and arrays with a mix of positive and negative numbers. 

The code should also be modified to correctly handle the case where the input array has a total sum of non-zero, but all the subarrays have a sum of zero. 

Overall, the code provided does not correctly solve the problem, and it needs to be modified to handle all the edge cases and to print the output in the correct format.
