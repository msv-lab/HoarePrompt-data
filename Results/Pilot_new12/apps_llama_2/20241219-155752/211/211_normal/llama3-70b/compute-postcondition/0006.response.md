The code updates the `prefix_sum` list by assigning the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` to `prefix_sum[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, and `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, the value of `prefix_sum[2]` becomes `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`, which is `a[0] + a[1]`.

The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is still a list of `n` integers. The value of `i` is still 1. 

The `prefix_sum` list is updated, where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, and `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`. The rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` (from index 3 onwards) are still 0, because the code only updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` when `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, and the rest of the elements are 0, `i` is 1**
