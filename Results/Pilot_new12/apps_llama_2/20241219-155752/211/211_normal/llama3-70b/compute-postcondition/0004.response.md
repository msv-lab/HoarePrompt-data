The value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` becomes `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`. Since `prefix_sum` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0. Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` becomes `0 + a[0]`, which simplifies to `a[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, and the rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` are 0, `i` is 0**
