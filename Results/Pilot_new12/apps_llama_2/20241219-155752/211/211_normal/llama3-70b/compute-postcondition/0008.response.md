The code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the `prefix_sum` list by adding the current element of `a` to the previous prefix sum. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where the first two elements are already defined and the rest are to be calculated, and `i` is 2.

`prefix_sum[i + 1]` becomes `prefix_sum[2 + 1]`, which simplifies to `prefix_sum[3]`. This element is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where the first three elements are defined with `prefix_sum[3]` equal to `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where the first three elements are defined with `prefix_sum[3]` equal to `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`, and `i` is 2**
