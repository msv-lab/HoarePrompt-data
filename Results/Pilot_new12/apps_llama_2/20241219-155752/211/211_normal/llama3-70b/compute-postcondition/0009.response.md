To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can analyze the pattern observed in the given output states after the loop executes a few times and relate it to the loop's code.

The loop calculates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` by adding `a[i]` to `prefix_sum[i]`. This means each element in `prefix_sum` (starting from the second element, index 1) is the sum of all elements in `a` up to the corresponding index.

Given the loop executes `n` times (since `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), after all iterations, `prefix_sum` will contain the cumulative sum of `a` at each position:

- `prefix_sum[0]` will remain 0 (as initialized and never changed).
- `prefix_sum[1]` will be `a[0]`.
- `prefix_sum[2]` will be `a[0] + a[1]`.
- This pattern continues until `prefix_sum[n]`, which will be the sum of all elements in `a`.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute at least once if `n` is 1, and up to 100 times if `n` is 100. If `n` were 0 (outside the given range), the loop would not execute, and `prefix_sum` would remain a list of `n+1` zeros, but since `n` is between 1 and 100, this scenario does not apply within the given constraints.

After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because it starts at 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

The original value of `n` being between 1 and 100 implies that after the loop, `n` itself does not change; it remains the same as its initial value, which is the number of elements in list `a`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is characterized by:

- `n` remaining as initially set, an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` remaining the same list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` being a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `i+1` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `a` (with `prefix_sum[0]` being 0, `prefix_sum[1]` being `a[0]`, and so on until `prefix_sum[n]` which equals the sum of all elements in `a`).
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n-1`.**
