To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
        print(k, l, r)
        k += 1
        l = r
```
The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0.
- 'YES' has been printed.
- `k` is 1.
- `l` is 1.

From the loop code, we can observe the following:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- Inside the loop, it checks if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
- If the condition is met, it prints the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`, then increments `k` by 1 and updates `l` to the current value of `r`.

Considering the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see the pattern that:
- `k` increments by 1 each time the condition `prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]` is met.
- `l` is updated to the current value of `r` when the condition is met.
- The values of `k`, `l`, and `r` are printed whenever the condition is met.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state of the variables can be determined as follows:
- `n` remains the same as it's not updated within the loop.
- `a` remains the same as it's not updated within the loop.
- `prefix_sum` remains the same as it's not updated within the loop.
- `i` remains `n-1` as it's not updated within the loop.
- The sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) remains not equal to 0.
- 'YES' has been printed (this is a one-time action before the loop and does not change).
- `k` will be incremented by 1 for each `r` where `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
- `l` will be the last value of `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
- If no `r` satisfies `prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` remains 1 and `l` remains 1.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1 plus the number of `r` values for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or 1 if no such `r` exists.**
