The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `k` is either 1 or 2, depending on the condition `prefix_sum[r]` being equal to 0 or `prefix_sum[n]`. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is initially 2, so the new value of `k` is 3. If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is initially 1, so the new value of `k` is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 3, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 2, 1, 2 have been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 1, 1, 2 have been printed, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed in the case of `prefix_sum[r]` not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 3, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 2, 1, 2 have been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 1, 1, 2 have been printed, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed in the case of `prefix_sum[r]` not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
