According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2. The state of `prefix_sum` would also change as the loop progresses, but based on the given state, we can assume that the rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` would be calculated in the next iteration if `n` is greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where the first two elements are already defined and the rest are to be calculated, `i` is 2**
