The code snippet simply prints 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables in the program. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, and 'YES' has been printed**
