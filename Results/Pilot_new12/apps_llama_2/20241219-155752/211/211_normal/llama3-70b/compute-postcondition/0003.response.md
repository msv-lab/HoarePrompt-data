To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions:

- The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which means `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, which implies that `a` is not empty since `n` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, which is initialized and ready for use within the loop.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(n):`, the key factor for the loop's execution is the value of `n`. Since `n` is already defined to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` is the variable that will be iterated over the range defined by `n`. Thus, before the loop begins its first execution, `i` should be set to the first value it will take in the loop, which is 0, given the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

Therefore, considering all conditions, the states that need adjustment or specification for the loop to execute are as follows:

- `n` is confirmed to be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), ensuring the loop can execute.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `i` is adjusted to be 0, as it will take on this value during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0**
