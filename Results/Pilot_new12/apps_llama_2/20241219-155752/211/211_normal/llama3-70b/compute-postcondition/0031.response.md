Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the values 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed, `k` = 4, `l` = 3, `r` = 3, and the values 3, 2, 3 have been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the values 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed, `k` = 3, `l` = 3, `r` = 3, and the values 2, 2, 3 have been printed.***
