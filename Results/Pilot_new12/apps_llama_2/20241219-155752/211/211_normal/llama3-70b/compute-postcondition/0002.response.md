The code creates a new list called `prefix_sum` and initializes it with `n + 1` zeros. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
