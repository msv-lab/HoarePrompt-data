The given Python code snippet is `print(k, l, r)`. This code prints the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers
- `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`
- `i` is `n-1`
- The sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0
- 'YES' has been printed
- `k` is 1
- `l` is 1
- `r` is 1
- The current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`

Since the code only prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` and does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition that the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
