The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The input integer represents the number of elements in the array `A`. 

Since the input will contain two lines and the code only reads the first line, the second line containing `n` integers is not yet processed. 

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state.

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the second line of input containing `n` integers is not yet processed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the second line of input containing `n` integers is not yet processed**
