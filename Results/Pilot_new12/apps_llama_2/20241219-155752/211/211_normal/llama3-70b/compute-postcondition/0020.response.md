The value of `l` is updated to be equal to the value of `r`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 2, `l` is equal to `r` which is 1, `r` is 1, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed, the current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.
