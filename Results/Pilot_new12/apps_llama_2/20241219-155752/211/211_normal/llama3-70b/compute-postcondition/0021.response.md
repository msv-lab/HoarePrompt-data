Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1.***
