The value of `l` is updated to be equal to the value of `r`. The value of `r` can be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, the values 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, otherwise the values 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed, and either `k` = 4, `l` = 3, `r` = 3, and the values 3, 2, 3 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or `k` = 3, `l` = 3, `r` = 3, and the values 2, 2, 3 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, the values 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, otherwise the values 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed, and either `k` = 4, `l` = 3, `r` = 3, and the values 3, 2, 3 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or `k` = 3, `l` = 3, `r` = 3, and the values 2, 2, 3 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
