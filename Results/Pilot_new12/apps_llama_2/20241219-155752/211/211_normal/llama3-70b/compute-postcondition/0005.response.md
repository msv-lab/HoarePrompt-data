According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, and the rest of the elements in `prefix_sum` are 0, `i` is 1**
