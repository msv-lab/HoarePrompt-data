The given Python code snippet is `print(k, l, r)`. The impact of this code on the program is that it prints the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. 

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0.
- 'YES' has been printed.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 2.
- The values 1, 1, 1 have been printed if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.

The values of `k`, `l`, and `r` are printed, but this does not change their values. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0.
- 'YES' has been printed.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 2.
- The values of `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed.

However, we know the exact values of `k`, `l`, and `r` based on the conditions given, so we can be more specific:
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the values 2, 1, 2 have been printed.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the values 1, 1, 2 have been printed.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows, taking into account that regardless of the condition, `r` is always 2, `l` is always 1, but `k` can be either 1 or 2 based on the condition of `prefix_sum[r]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 2, 1, 2 have been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 1, 1, 2 have been printed, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed in the case of `prefix_sum[r]` not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
