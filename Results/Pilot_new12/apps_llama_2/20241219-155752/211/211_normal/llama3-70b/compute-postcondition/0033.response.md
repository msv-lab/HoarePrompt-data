The code provided prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. The values of `k`, `l`, and `n` are not changed by the print statement. 

`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1 plus the number of `r` values for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or 1 if no such `r` exists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1 plus the number of `r` values for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `l` is the last `r` for which `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, or 1 if no such `r` exists, and the values of `k`, `l`, `n` have been printed.**
