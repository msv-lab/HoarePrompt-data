Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n-1`. The current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, meaning the sum of all elements in `a` equals 0.**
