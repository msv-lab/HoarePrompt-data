The code is processing a line of input containing `n` integers. The `map` function is applying `int` to each of these integers, effectively converting them to integers, and `list` is converting the resulting map object to a list. This list is then assigned to the variable `a`.

Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the list `a` will contain `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers**
