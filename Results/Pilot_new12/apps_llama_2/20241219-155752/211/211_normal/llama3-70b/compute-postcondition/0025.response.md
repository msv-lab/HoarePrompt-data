The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `r`. The previous values of `l` and `r` are 1 and 2 respectively, in the case of `prefix_sum[r]` not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and 1 and 2 respectively, in the case of `prefix_sum[r]` equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 3, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, and the values 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, and the values 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 have been printed**
