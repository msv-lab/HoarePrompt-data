It seems like there is missing information regarding the output of the function. However, I can still guide you through the process of describing the functionality based on the given input parameters.


The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is stated that the input will contain two lines: 
1. The first line is a single integer `n`, representing the number of elements in the array `A`.
2. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, representing the elements of the array `A`.


Given that the output details are missing, I'll provide a general template based on the input information.


Functionality: **The function accepts input in the form of two lines: the first line containing an integer n, and the second line containing n integers representing the elements of array A, and processes this input to produce an unspecified output.**
