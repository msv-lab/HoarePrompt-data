The code prints 'NO' to the console, but does not modify any variables. 
The states of the variables `n`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, and `i` are not affected by the code. 
Therefore, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is still a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and `i` is still `n-1`. 
The value of `prefix_sum[n]` is still 0, meaning the sum of all elements in `a` still equals 0. 
The string 'NO' has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
