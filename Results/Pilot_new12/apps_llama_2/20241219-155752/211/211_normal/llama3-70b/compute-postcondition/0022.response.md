To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0.
- `'YES'` has been printed.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed.
- If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1.

Loop statement:
```python
for r in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is 1. 

So, for the loop to execute again, `r` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `r` becomes 2. 

Since `r` has changed, we must consider how `prefix_sum[r]` is affected, but the specific values of `k` and `l` and whether '1, 1, 1' have been printed do not directly depend on the loop variable `r` in a way that requires adjustment based on the loop statement alone. The state of `k`, `l`, and the printed values might change based on the loop body, which is not provided. However, based on the loop statement and the given conditions, the state adjustment for the next iteration would focus on the loop variable `r`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` equals the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, the sum of all elements in `a` (or `prefix_sum[n]`) is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 1, 1, 1 have been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is equal to 0 or equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 2**
