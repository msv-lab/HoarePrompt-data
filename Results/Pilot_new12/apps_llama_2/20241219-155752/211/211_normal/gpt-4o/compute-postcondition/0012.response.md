The code prints '1' and the value of `i + 1` to the console. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The states of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` are not affected. However, in addition to '2', '1' and '1' have now been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, and '2', '1', and '1' have been printed to the console.**
