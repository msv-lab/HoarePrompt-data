According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), this condition is already met. The loop will start with `i` equal to 0, since the `range` function in Python generates numbers starting from 0 by default.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
