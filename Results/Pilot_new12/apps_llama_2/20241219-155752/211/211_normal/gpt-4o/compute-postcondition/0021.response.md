The given code is a `break` statement. This statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement. In this case, since there's no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger code structure, possibly inside a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `A` is a list of `n` integers
- `total_sum` is 0
- `i` is 1
- '1', '2', '3', and the value of `n` have been printed to the console

The `break` statement itself does not modify any variable's value or the list's content. Its purpose is to terminate the loop it's enclosed within. Therefore, after executing the `break` statement:

- The loop (if there is one enclosing this statement) will be exited.
- The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect these variables directly.
- The print operations that occurred before this statement have already been executed, so '1', '2', '3', and the value of `n` will still have been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, '1', '2', '3', and the value of `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
