Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array `A`, and the next line contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array `A`. It calculates the sum of the elements in the array `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES', '1', and the range '1' to `n`. If the sum is zero, it checks for the first non-zero element in the array `A` and prints 'YES', '2', and two ranges: '1' to the index of the first non-zero element and the index after the first non-zero element to `n`. If all elements are zero, it only prints nothing after the initial checks, as there is no handling for this case in the provided code. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console. The final state of the program includes the input parameters `n` and the array `A`, and the calculated sum of the elements in `A`, but these are not explicitly returned or saved; instead, the results are printed to the console based on the calculated sum and the presence of non-zero elements in the array `A**.
