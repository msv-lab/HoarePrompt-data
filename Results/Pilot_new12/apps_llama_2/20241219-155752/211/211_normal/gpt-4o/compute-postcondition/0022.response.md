Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, then '1', '2', '3', and the value of `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `A[i]` is equal to 0, then no additional actions have been taken.***
