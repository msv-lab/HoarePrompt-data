To calculate the output state, we should consider the impact of the given Python code on the program. The code `print(i + 2, n)` will print the values of `i + 2` and `n` to the console.

Given that `i` is 1, `i + 2` equals 3. So, the numbers '1', '2', '3', and the value of `n` will have been printed to the console after executing this code.

The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` are not changed by this code snippet. `n` remains an integer greater than 1, `A` remains a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` remains 0, and `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and '1', '2', '3', and the value of `n` have been printed to the console**
