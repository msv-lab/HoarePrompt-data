To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, which means it will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, which means we are just starting or have completed the first iteration.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to run again, `i` should become 1.

Given state: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0.

- `n` being between 1 and 100 (inclusive) means the loop can potentially run up to 100 times, but since `i` is currently 0, we are at the beginning.
- `A` is a list of `n` integers, but its contents and how it affects the loop are not directly relevant to the loop condition itself, which only depends on `n`.
- `total_sum` is 0, but its value does not affect the loop condition.
- `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must become 1, which is less than `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to increment by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- Since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1**
