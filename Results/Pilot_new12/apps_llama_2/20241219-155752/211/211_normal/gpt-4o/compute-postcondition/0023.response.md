According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2, but since we know `n` is greater than 1 and now we need `n` to be at least 2 for the second iteration to happen, it can be said `n` is greater than 1 and now since we had one iteration `n` must be at least 2 for the second iteration, hence `n` must be greater than 1 and the condition is met when `n` is at least 2, hence we change the state of `n` to be at least 2. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2**
