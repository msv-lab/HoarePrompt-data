The code prints '1' and the value of `i + 1` to the console. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The states of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` are not affected. '2' has been previously printed to the console and now '1' and '2' have been printed to the console. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1 and '1' and '2' have been printed to the console**
