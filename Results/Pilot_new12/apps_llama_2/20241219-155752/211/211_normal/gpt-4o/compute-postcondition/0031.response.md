Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES', '1', '1', and the value of `n` have been printed to the console. If `total_sum` is 0, `i` is either the index of the first non-zero element in `A` or `n-1` if all elements are zero.**
