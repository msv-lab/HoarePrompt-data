Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1 and at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, then 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '3' has been printed, '4' has been printed, the value of `n` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
