The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` do not change. The expression `i + 2` equals `2` because `i` equals `0`, and `n` is used as is. '2', '1', '1', `2`, and `n` have been printed to the console.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, and '2', '1', '1', '2', and `n` have been printed to the console.**
