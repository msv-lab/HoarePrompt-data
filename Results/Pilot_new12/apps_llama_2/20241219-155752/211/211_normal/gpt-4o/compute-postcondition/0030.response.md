To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over the list `A` of `n` integers. If it finds a non-zero element, it prints specific values and breaks out of the loop. If it iterates over the entire list without finding a non-zero element, it prints 'NO'.

From the loop code:

- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0.
- If `A[i]` is not 0 during any iteration, the loop will print 'YES', '2', '1' followed by the current index plus 1, and the current index plus 2 followed by `n`, then break.
- If the loop iterates over all elements of `A` without finding a non-zero element, it will print 'NO' after the loop.

Given that `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and is initially 0, and considering the loop's behavior:

- If `A` contains at least one non-zero element, the loop will find it, print the specified values, and break. This means `i` will be the index of the first non-zero element found.
- If `A` contains only zeros, the loop will iterate over all elements and then print 'NO'. In this case, `i` will be `n-1` after the loop because it increments one last time before exiting the loop.

Thus, considering all possible scenarios:

- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) since the loop doesn't modify `n`.
- `A` remains a list of `n` integers, as the loop doesn't modify `A`.
- `total_sum` remains 0, as the loop doesn't modify `total_sum`.
- `i` will either be the index of the first non-zero element in `A` if such an element exists, or `n-1` if all elements in `A` are zero.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is either the index of the first non-zero element in `A` or `n-1` if all elements are zero.**
