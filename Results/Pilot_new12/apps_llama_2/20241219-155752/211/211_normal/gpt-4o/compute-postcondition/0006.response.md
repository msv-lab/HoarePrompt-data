The code prints the string '1' and the value of `n` to the console. The values of the variables do not change. 'YES' and '1' have already been printed to the console, and now '1' and the value of `n` are also printed. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and not equal to 0, 'YES', '1', '1', and the value of `n` have been printed to the console.
