The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` do not change. The state of the console remains the same, having printed '2', '1', '1', '2', and `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `A` at index `i` is not 0, '2', '1', '1', '2', and `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
