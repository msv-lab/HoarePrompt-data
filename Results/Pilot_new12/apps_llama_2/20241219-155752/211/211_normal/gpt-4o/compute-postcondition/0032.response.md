The function `func` takes no explicit input parameters but reads from the standard input. It first reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements in array `A`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. Then, it reads `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` representing the elements of array `A`, where each element is in the range `-10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3`. 

Since the specific return value is not provided in the problem description, I'll proceed based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts input from the standard input, reads an integer n and an array A of n integers, and processes this input, but the specific return value or output is not defined in the provided problem description.**
