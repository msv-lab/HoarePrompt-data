The code prints '1' and the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. The values of the other variables are not changed. '1' and '3' have been printed in addition to 'YES' and '2' that were printed before. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, and '3' has been printed**
