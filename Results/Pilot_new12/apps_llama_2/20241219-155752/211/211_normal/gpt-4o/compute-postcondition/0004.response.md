The code snippet print('YES') simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `A`, and `total_sum` are not affected by this operation. The variable `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is still a list of `n` integers, and `total_sum` is still the sum of all elements in `A` and not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and not equal to 0, and 'YES' has been printed to the console**
