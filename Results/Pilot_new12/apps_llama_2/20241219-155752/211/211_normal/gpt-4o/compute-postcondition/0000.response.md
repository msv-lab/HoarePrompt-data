The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The input integer represents the number of elements in the array A. 

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) because the problem statement specifies that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The initial state also mentions that the next line contains n integers, but this line is not read by the given code snippet. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code because there are no other variables in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the next line of input contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array A**.
