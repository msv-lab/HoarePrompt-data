The code snippet `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings separated by whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the results in a list `A`.

Given the initial state: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the next line of input contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array `A`, we can conclude that:

- The value of `n` remains the same, an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `A` is assigned a list of `n` integers, which are the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers, where the integers are the input values**
