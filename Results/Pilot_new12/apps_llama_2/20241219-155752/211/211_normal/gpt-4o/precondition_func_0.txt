The function takes no explicit input parameters, but it reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A, and the next line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (-10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array A.
