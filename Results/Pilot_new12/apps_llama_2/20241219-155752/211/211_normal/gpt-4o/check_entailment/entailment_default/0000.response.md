Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully satisfy the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case when the sum of the array elements is zero, and all elements but one are zero. In this case, the program should split the array into multiple non-zero sum subarrays. However, the provided code only checks for the first non-zero element and splits the array accordingly, which may not always result in subarrays with non-zero sums.

For example, the input `[0, 0, 5, -5, 0]` should be split into `(1, 3)` and `(4, 5)` to satisfy the condition of non-zero sums for each subarray. However, the provided code does not handle this case correctly. It will either print 'NO' if it does not find a non-zero element at the start or end of the array or split the array incorrectly.

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the array can be split into more than two subarrays. The problem statement allows for the array to be split into "several, possibly one, new arrays," but the code only handles splits into one or two subarrays.

Therefore, the code does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
