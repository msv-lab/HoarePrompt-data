Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in the case where the total sum of the array is not zero, but there is no single element that is non-zero. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```
The total sum of the array is 0, which means it should print "NO". However, the program will print "YES" and then print "1" and "1 4", because it checks if the total sum is not zero and then assumes that the array can be split into one subarray.

Another example is when all elements of the array are the same and sum up to zero, but the number of elements is more than 2, in this case the program will not work correctly either.

The program also does not handle cases where the array can be split into more than two non-zero subarrays correctly. It only checks for the condition where the total sum is not zero or where it can be split into two parts, one of which contains only one non-zero element.

In general, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases of the problem. It assumes that the array can be split into one or two parts and does not check for other possible cases, such as splitting the array into more than two parts. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
