The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the array can be split into multiple non-empty subarrays with non-zero sums. This assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context, but it does not change the fact that the program has a limited approach to splitting the array. The program only checks if the total sum of the array is non-zero or if a single element is non-zero. If the total sum is zero, it attempts to split the array into two parts: the first part contains the first non-zero element and the second part contains the rest of the array. However, this approach is not sufficient to handle all possible cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 -3 4 -4
```
In this case, the program will print "NO" because it cannot find a single non-zero element or split the array into two parts with non-zero sums. However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
3
1 2
3 3
4 5
```
This example illustrates the limitation of the program's approach and supports the original assessment.

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not implement a more complex algorithm that attempts to split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible cases.

Therefore, based on the provided code, problem description, and annotated version, I conclude that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
