Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the array can be split into multiple non-empty subarrays with non-zero sums.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 -3 4 -4
```
In this case, the program will print "NO" because the total sum of the array is zero. However, the array can be split into multiple non-empty subarrays with non-zero sums: `[1, 2]`, `[-3]`, `[4, -4]`. The correct output should be:
```
YES
3
1 2
3 3
4 5
```
The program's logic is incorrect because it only checks if the total sum of the array is non-zero or if a single element is non-zero. It does not attempt to split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums.

To fix this, the program would need to implement a more complex algorithm that attempts to split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums, rather than simply checking the total sum or individual elements.
