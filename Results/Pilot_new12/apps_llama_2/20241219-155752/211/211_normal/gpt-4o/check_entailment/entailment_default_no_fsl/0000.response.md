Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue is that it does not correctly handle the case when the sum of the elements in the array is zero. In this case, the problem description requires that the program prints "NO" if it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. However, the provided code does not handle this case correctly. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
0 0 0 0
```
The code will not print anything after the initial checks, because it only checks for the first non-zero element and does not have a handling for the case when all elements are zero. It should print "NO" in this case, but it does not. 

Another issue is that the code does not correctly split the array into subarrays when the sum of the elements is not zero. It simply prints the entire array as a single subarray, but it does not consider the case when there are multiple subarrays with non-zero sums.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 2 -3 4 -4
```
The code will print:
```
YES
1
1 5
```
But this is not a correct solution, because the sum of the elements in the subarray [1, 2, -3, 4, -4] is not zero, but there are also other possible subarrays with non-zero sums, such as [1, 2] and [4]. The code should find these subarrays and print them as separate subarrays.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
