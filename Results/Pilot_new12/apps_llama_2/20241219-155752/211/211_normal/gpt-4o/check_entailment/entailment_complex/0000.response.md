Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

One reason for this is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the total sum of the array elements is zero and all elements are zero. In this case, the program should print 'NO', but it does not have any handling for this case. Instead, it simply does not print anything, which does not meet the problem description.

Another reason is that the program does not correctly split the array into subarrays when the total sum is zero and there are non-zero elements. The program currently splits the array into two subarrays: from the first element to the first non-zero element and from the element after the first non-zero element to the end of the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero, which is a requirement of the problem description. 

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a different approach, such as iterating over the array and splitting it into subarrays whenever the sum of elements becomes zero, or using a more complex algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly handle the case when the total sum is zero and all elements are zero:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum!= 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        if all(x == 0 for x in A):
            print('NO')
        else:
            for i in range(n):
                if A[i]!= 0:
                    print('YES')
                    print('2')
                    print('1', i + 1)
                    print(i + 2, n)
                    break
```

This modified program checks if all elements are zero when the total sum is zero, and if so, prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it splits the array into two subarrays as before. However, this is still not a correct solution to the problem, as it does not guarantee that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero.

To correctly solve the problem, a more complex algorithm would be needed, such as iterating over the array and splitting it into subarrays whenever the sum of elements becomes zero, or using dynamic programming to find the optimal way to split the array. 

Here's an example of a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum == 0:
        if all(x == 0 for x in A):
            print('NO')
            return
        result = []
        current_sum = 0
        start = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += A[i]
            if current_sum!= 0:
                result.append((start + 1, i + 1))
                start = i + 1
                current_sum = 0
        print('YES')
        print(len(result))
        for start, end in result:
            print(start, end)
    else:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
```
