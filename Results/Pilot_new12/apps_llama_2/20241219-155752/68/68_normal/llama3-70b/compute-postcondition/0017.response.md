If x is greater than the sum of y and z, '+' has been printed to the console. If x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, then if x is less than y, a hyphen (-) has been printed; otherwise, if x equals y, then either '0' has been printed to the console when z is 0, or '?' has been printed when z is a non-zero positive integer; if x is greater than y, '?' has been printed to the console.**
