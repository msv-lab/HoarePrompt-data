The given code is a simple print statement that prints a '?' character. This operation does not change the values of any variables. 

Given that x = y, x ≤ y + z, x ≥ y, and z ≠ 0, and considering that x = y, the conditions x ≤ y + z and x ≥ y are equivalent to y ≤ y + z and y ≥ y. Since y ≤ y + z is always true when z is positive or zero, and given z ≠ 0, the critical aspect here is that z can be any non-zero integer (positive or negative). However, because x = y and x ≥ y, this condition does not add new constraints beyond x = y. The condition that provides meaningful constraint is x ≤ y + z, which simplifies to 0 ≤ z since x = y. This indicates z must be positive or zero, but since z ≠ 0, z must be positive.

However, considering all given conditions and the fact that the print statement does not alter variable values, the precise interpretation depends on understanding that x = y, and the relationship with z (z ≠ 0 and considering x ≤ y + z simplifies to 0 ≤ z when x = y). Thus, the conditions imply x = y and z > 0 because for x = y, the condition x ≤ y + z implies z can be any positive value to satisfy the condition given x = y.

The output of the print statement is '?', but this is not a variable state change; it's an output to the user. The variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **x = y, z is a non-zero positive integer as z > 0 since z ≠ 0 and considering x = y, the condition x ≤ y + z holds true for any positive z, x and y are input integers**
