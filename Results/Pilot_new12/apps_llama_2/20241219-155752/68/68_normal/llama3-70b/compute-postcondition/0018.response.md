The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` as described in the problem. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, we can infer that the function should accept three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are non-negative integers less than or equal to 100. 

Since the output is not explicitly described, I will assume a general case based on common practices. 

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively. The return value is not specified in the problem, so we cannot determine the exact output.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z, which are non-negative integers less than or equal to 100, but the return value is not specified.**
