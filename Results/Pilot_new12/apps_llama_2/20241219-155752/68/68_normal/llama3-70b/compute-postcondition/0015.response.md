Postcondition: **x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input, x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, and x is greater than or equal to y. If x equals y, then if z is 0, '0' has been printed to the console, otherwise z is a non-zero positive integer. If x does not equal y, then '?' has been printed to the console.**
