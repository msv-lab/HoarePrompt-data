Postcondition: **x, y, and z are input integers, the current value of x is equal to the current value of y, x (which equals y) is less than or equal to the sum of y (which equals x) and z, and x (which equals y) is greater than or equal to y (which equals x). Additionally, the current value of z is 0, which means the current value of x (which equals y) is less than or equal to the current value of y (which equals x) since z is 0, and the current value of x (which equals y) is greater than or equal to the current value of y (which equals x).**
