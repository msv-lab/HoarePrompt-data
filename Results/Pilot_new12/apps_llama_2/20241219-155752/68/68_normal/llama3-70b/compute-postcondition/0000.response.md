The code is assigning the values from the input to the variables x, y, and z. These values are the result of splitting the input string into substrings separated by spaces and converting each substring to an integer. The input is not specified, so the values of x, y, and z will be the input integers.

Output State: **x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input**
