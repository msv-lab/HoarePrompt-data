Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the conditions used to determine the outcome of the vote.

The problem description states that the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the z persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations. This means we need to check if the outcome can be different when all z persons vote up and when all z persons vote down.

However, the program does not handle this correctly. For example, when x is greater than y but less than or equal to y + z, the program prints '?' without checking if the outcome can actually be different.

A correct solution should check if x + z > y and x < y, because in this case, the outcome can be different depending on how the z persons vote. If x + z > y and x < y, it means that if all z persons vote up, the outcome will be '+' or '0', but if all z persons vote down, the outcome will be '-'. This is an uncertain case, so the program should print '?'.

On the other hand, if x + z <= y, it means that even if all z persons vote up, the outcome will still be '-' or '0', so the program should print '-' or '0' accordingly.

Similarly, if x > y + z, it means that the outcome will always be '+', regardless of how the z persons vote. And if x == y and z == 0, it means that the outcome will always be '0'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if x + z > y and x < y:
        print('?')
    elif x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('+')
```
This corrected version checks all the cases correctly and prints the outcome according to the problem description.
