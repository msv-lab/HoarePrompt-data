Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code, output hints, and problem description, I believe the code correctly handles all potential cases. The function `func()` takes three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input and prints the outcome of a vote based on the number of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and votes with unknown outcomes (`z`).

The function correctly prints:
* '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, indicating that there will be more upvotes than downvotes regardless of the unknown votes.
* '-' if `x` is less than `y`, indicating that there will be more downvotes than upvotes regardless of the unknown votes.
* '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, indicating that there will be an equal number of upvotes and downvotes.
* '?' otherwise, indicating that the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

The code handles all edge cases correctly, including when `x` equals `y`, or `z` is 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.

Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code:
* Input (3, 7, 0) prints '-'.
* Input (2, 0, 1) prints '+'.
* Input (1, 1, 0) prints '0'.
* Input (0, 0, 1) prints '?'.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
