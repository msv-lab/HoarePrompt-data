You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program checks all possible conditions based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z). 

1. If x > y + z, it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the upvotes will still be more, so the result is '+'.

2. If x < y, it means that the downvotes are already more than upvotes, so the result is '-'.

3. If x == y, it means that the upvotes and downvotes are equal. If there are no unknown votes (z == 0), the result is '0'. If there are unknown votes, the result is uncertain ('?').

4. If x > y but x <= y + z, it means that if all unknown votes are downvotes, the downvotes will be more than upvotes, but if all or some unknown votes are upvotes, the upvotes could be more than downvotes. In this case, the result is uncertain ('?').

The program handles all these cases correctly and outputs the correct result. I was unable to find any potential case that the program does not handle as per the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers less than or equal to 100, representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x equals y, if z is 0, '0' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, z is a non-zero positive integer, and x = y, and x â‰¤ y + z holds true, given that x and y are input integers.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input, x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, and x is greater than or equal to y. If x equals y, then if z is 0, '0' has been printed to the console, otherwise z is a non-zero positive integer. If x does not equal y, then '?' has been printed to the console.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input, and x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z. If x is less than y, a hyphen (-) has been printed. If x is greater than or equal to y, then if x equals y, either '0' has been printed to the console when z is 0, or z is a non-zero positive integer; otherwise, '?' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, '+' has been printed to the console. If x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, then if x is less than y, a hyphen (-) has been printed; otherwise, if x equals y, then either '0' has been printed to the console when z is 0, or '?' has been printed when z is a non-zero positive integer; if x is greater than y, '?' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the outcome of a vote based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and votes with unknown outcomes (z). It accepts three non-negative integers less than or equal to 100 as input, representing x, y, and z, and prints a character to the console indicating the outcome: '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, and '?' otherwise. The function does not return a value. After the function concludes, the console will contain a character indicating the outcome of the vote, and the input integers x, y, and z will remain unchanged. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases where x equals y, or z is 0, or x is greater than or equal to y but less than or equal to the sum of y and z.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
