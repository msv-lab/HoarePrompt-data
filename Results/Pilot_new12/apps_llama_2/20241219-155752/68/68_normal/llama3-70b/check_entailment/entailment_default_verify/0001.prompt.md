You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the result of the upvotes and downvotes based on the given problem description. 

The program first checks if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the sum of downvotes `y` and uncertain votes `z`. If this condition is true, it prints '+', indicating that the result will definitely be positive, regardless of how the uncertain votes are cast.

Next, it checks if the number of upvotes `x` is less than the number of downvotes `y`. If this condition is true, it prints '-', indicating that the result will definitely be negative, regardless of how the uncertain votes are cast.

If neither of the above conditions is true, it checks if the number of upvotes `x` is equal to the number of downvotes `y`. If this is the case and there are no uncertain votes `z`, it prints '0', indicating that the result will be a tie. If there are uncertain votes `z`, it prints '?', indicating that the result is uncertain.

Finally, if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the number of downvotes `y` but less than or equal to the sum of downvotes `y` and uncertain votes `z`, the program prints '?', indicating that the result is uncertain.

This covers all possible cases, and the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct. 

However, a more elegant and clear way to write this function could be:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_up = x + 0
    max_up = x + z
    min_down = y + 0
    max_down = y + z

    if max_up > max_down:
        print('+')
    elif min_up < min_down:
        print('-')
    elif max_up == max_down or min_up == min_down:
        if x + z == y + z:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```
Or even simpler:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x + z < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('+' if x + z > y else '-' if x < y else '0' if x == y and z == 0 else '?')
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function determines the outcome of a vote based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and votes with unknown outcomes (z). It accepts three non-negative integers less than or equal to 100 as input, representing x, y, and z, and prints a character to the console indicating the outcome: '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, and '?' otherwise. The function does not return a value. After the function concludes, the console will contain a character indicating the outcome of the vote, and the input integers x, y, and z will remain unchanged. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases where x equals y, or z is 0, or x is greater than or equal to y but less than or equal to the sum of y and z.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
