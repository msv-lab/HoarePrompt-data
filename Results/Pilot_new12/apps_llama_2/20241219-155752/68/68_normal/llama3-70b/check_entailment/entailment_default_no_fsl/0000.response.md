Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example, consider the case where x = 5, y = 3, and z = 2. In this case, if all unknown votes are upvotes, the result is "+" (5 + 2 = 7 > 3), and if all unknown votes are downvotes, the result is "+" (5 > 3 + 2 is False, but 5 > 3 is True and 5 < 3 + 2 is False). However, the code will print "?" because it checks if x > y + z, which is False, and then checks if x < y, which is False, and then it checks if x == y, which is False, so it prints "?" because none of the other conditions are met. 

However, the correct output in this case should be "+", because no matter how the unknown votes are cast, the result will always be "+". This is an example where the code does not follow the problem description, and therefore, the correctness of the program is False. 

A correct implementation would need to consider all possible outcomes of the unknown votes and determine if the result is always the same or if there are multiple possible results.
