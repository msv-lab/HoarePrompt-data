Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the result of the upvotes and downvotes based on the given problem description. 

The program first checks if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the sum of downvotes `y` and uncertain votes `z`. If this condition is true, it prints '+', indicating that the result will definitely be positive, regardless of how the uncertain votes are cast.

Next, it checks if the number of upvotes `x` is less than the number of downvotes `y`. If this condition is true, it prints '-', indicating that the result will definitely be negative, regardless of how the uncertain votes are cast.

If neither of the above conditions is true, it checks if the number of upvotes `x` is equal to the number of downvotes `y`. If this is the case and there are no uncertain votes `z`, it prints '0', indicating that the result will be a tie. If there are uncertain votes `z`, it prints '?', indicating that the result is uncertain.

Finally, if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the number of downvotes `y` but less than or equal to the sum of downvotes `y` and uncertain votes `z`, the program prints '?', indicating that the result is uncertain.

This covers all possible cases, and the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct. 

However, a more elegant and clear way to write this function could be:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_up = x + 0
    max_up = x + z
    min_down = y + 0
    max_down = y + z

    if max_up > max_down:
        print('+')
    elif min_up < min_down:
        print('-')
    elif max_up == max_down or min_up == min_down:
        if x + z == y + z:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')
```
Or even simpler:
```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x + z < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('+' if x + z > y else '-' if x < y else '0' if x == y and z == 0 else '?')
```
