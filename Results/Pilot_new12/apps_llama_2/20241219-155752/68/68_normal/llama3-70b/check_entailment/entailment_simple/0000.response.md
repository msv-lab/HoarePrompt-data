Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

The issue with the program lies in the condition where x > y. In this case, the program should check if x is greater than y + z before printing '+'. If x is less than or equal to y + z, it should print '?' because the outcome is uncertain.

However, in the given program, when x > y, it only checks if x > y + z and prints '+' if true. If x ≤ y + z, it then checks if x < y, which will always be false since we are in the x > y block. Then it checks if x == y, which is also false because we are in the x > y block. 

Finally, it has a default else statement that prints '?' only when x > y and x ≠ y and x ≤ y + z. However, this else statement is after the x == y check, which is not necessary and makes the program incorrect.

A correct program should have the following logic:
- If x > y + z, print '+' because all unknown votes cannot change the outcome.
- If x < y, print '-' because all unknown votes cannot change the outcome.
- If x == y and z == 0, print '0' because there are no unknown votes.
- In all other cases, print '?' because the outcome is uncertain.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    else:
        if x == y and z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
```
