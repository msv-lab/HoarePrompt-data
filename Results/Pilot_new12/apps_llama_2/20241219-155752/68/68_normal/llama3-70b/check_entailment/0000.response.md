Correctness: **True**.

The program checks all possible conditions based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z). 

1. If x > y + z, it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the upvotes will still be more, so the result is '+'.

2. If x < y, it means that the downvotes are already more than upvotes, so the result is '-'.

3. If x == y, it means that the upvotes and downvotes are equal. If there are no unknown votes (z == 0), the result is '0'. If there are unknown votes, the result is uncertain ('?').

4. If x > y but x <= y + z, it means that if all unknown votes are downvotes, the downvotes will be more than upvotes, but if all or some unknown votes are upvotes, the upvotes could be more than downvotes. In this case, the result is uncertain ('?').

The program handles all these cases correctly and outputs the correct result. I was unable to find any potential case that the program does not handle as per the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
