You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers less than or equal to 100, representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x equals y, if z is 0, '0' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, z is a non-zero positive integer, and x = y, and x â‰¤ y + z holds true, given that x and y are input integers.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input, x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, and x is greater than or equal to y. If x equals y, then if z is 0, '0' has been printed to the console, otherwise z is a non-zero positive integer. If x does not equal y, then '?' has been printed to the console.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input, and x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z. If x is less than y, a hyphen (-) has been printed. If x is greater than or equal to y, then if x equals y, either '0' has been printed to the console when z is 0, or z is a non-zero positive integer; otherwise, '?' has been printed to the console.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: x, y, and z are input integers, x is the first integer input, y is the second integer input, z is the third integer input. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, '+' has been printed to the console. If x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, then if x is less than y, a hyphen (-) has been printed; otherwise, if x equals y, then either '0' has been printed to the console when z is 0, or '?' has been printed when z is a non-zero positive integer; if x is greater than y, '?' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the outcome of a vote based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and votes with unknown outcomes (z). It accepts three non-negative integers less than or equal to 100 as input, representing x, y, and z, and prints a character to the console indicating the outcome: '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, and '?' otherwise. The function does not return a value. After the function concludes, the console will contain a character indicating the outcome of the vote, and the input integers x, y, and z will remain unchanged. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases where x equals y, or z is 0, or x is greater than or equal to y but less than or equal to the sum of y and z.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
