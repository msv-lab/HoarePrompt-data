The function determines the outcome of a vote based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and votes with unknown outcomes (z). It accepts three non-negative integers less than or equal to 100 as input, representing x, y, and z, and prints a character to the console indicating the outcome: '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z is 0, and '?' otherwise. The function does not return a value. After the function concludes, the console will contain a character indicating the outcome of the vote, and the input integers x, y, and z will remain unchanged. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases where x equals y, or z is 0, or x is greater than or equal to y but less than or equal to the sum of y and z.
