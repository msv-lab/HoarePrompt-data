Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly determines the outcome of the voting based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. 

Here's why it works:

- The minimum number of upvotes is the number of known upvotes (`x`), and the maximum number of upvotes is the number of known upvotes plus the number of unknown votes (`x + z`). 
- The minimum number of downvotes is the number of known downvotes (`y`), and the maximum number of downvotes is the number of known downvotes plus the number of unknown votes (`y + z`).

The program then checks two conditions:

- If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it prints `-`. This is because even if all unknown votes are upvotes, there will still be more downvotes than upvotes.
- If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints `+`. This is because even if all unknown votes are downvotes, there will still be more upvotes than downvotes.

If neither of these conditions is true, the program prints `?`, indicating that the result is uncertain. This is because there is a possibility of both more upvotes and more downvotes depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
