The original assessment states that the provided program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. After analyzing the problem description, the program, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment.

The program correctly handles all possible cases by calculating the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes. The output hints also confirm that the program behaves as expected, printing one of three possible characters to the console: `-` if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, `+` if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, or `?` if neither of the above conditions are met.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly classifies the input integers based on the specified conditions. The output hints provide examples of how the program behaves for different input cases, and they align with the expected behavior described in the problem description.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
