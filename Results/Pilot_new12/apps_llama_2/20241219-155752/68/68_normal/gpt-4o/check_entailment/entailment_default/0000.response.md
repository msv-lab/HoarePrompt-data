Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to accurately implement the logic described in the problem statement. It determines whether the result of the voting is certain or uncertain based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the scenarios where all unknown votes go to either upvotes or downvotes.

2. It then checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes. If so, it prints '-' because the result is certain to be a downvote.

3. If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints '+' because the result is certain to be an upvote.

4. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints '?' because the result is uncertain.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of its functionality. The problem description also includes examples that demonstrate the code's behavior, and the code produces the correct output for these examples.

For instance, when `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`, the code correctly prints '-' because the number of downvotes is greater than the number of upvotes. Similarly, when `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the code prints '+' because the number of upvotes is greater than the number of downvotes regardless of the unknown vote.

The code also handles the case where the result is uncertain, such as when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. In this scenario, the code prints '?' because the result depends on the unknown vote.

Overall, the code accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for all possible cases.
