Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the unknown votes as either upvotes or downvotes.
2. It checks if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes. If this condition is met, it prints '-' because the result is always a downvote, regardless of how the unknown votes are cast.
3. If the above condition is not met, it checks if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes. If this condition is met, it prints '+' because the result is always an upvote, regardless of how the unknown votes are cast.
4. If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints '?' because the result is uncertain, meaning that the outcome can be either an upvote, downvote, or a tie, depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

The program handles all possible cases:

- If `x + z < y`, it prints '-'.
- If `y + z < x`, it prints '+'.
- If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'.

The program does not modify the input values or return any value, and its purpose is to provide a simple classification based on the input integers, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.
