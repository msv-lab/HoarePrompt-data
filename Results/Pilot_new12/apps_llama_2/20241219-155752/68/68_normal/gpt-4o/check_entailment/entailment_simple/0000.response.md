Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to determine the result of the voting scenario described in the problem.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes (`min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes`) and downvotes (`min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes`) by considering all possible scenarios for the unknown votes (`z`).

2. If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it means that regardless of how the unknown votes are cast, the number of downvotes will always exceed the number of upvotes. In this case, the program correctly prints a `-`.

3. If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it means that regardless of how the unknown votes are cast, the number of upvotes will always exceed the number of downvotes. In this case, the program correctly prints a `+`.

4. If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the outcome of the voting is uncertain. In this case, the program correctly prints a `?`.

This logic covers all possible scenarios and accurately implements the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

For example, consider the case where `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`. The program calculates `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, and `max_downvotes = 7`. Since `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, the program prints a `-`, which is the correct result.

Another example is when `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. The program calculates `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, and `max_downvotes = 1`. Since `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, the program prints a `+`, which is the correct result.

Finally, consider the case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. The program calculates `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, and `max_downvotes = 1`. Since neither of the conditions is met, the program prints a `?`, indicating that the outcome is uncertain, which is again the correct result.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the result of the voting scenario, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem.
