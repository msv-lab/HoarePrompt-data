Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

The conditions for printing `+`, `-`, and `?` are also correctly implemented. The code prints `+` if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, `-` if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, and `?` otherwise. 

This logic ensures that the code correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. 

For instance, in the example where `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`, the code correctly prints `-` because the maximum possible upvotes (3) are less than the minimum possible downvotes (7). 

In the example where `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the code correctly prints `+` because the maximum possible downvotes (0 + 1 = 1) are less than the minimum possible upvotes (2). 

In the example where `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`, the code correctly prints `0` because the maximum possible upvotes (1) are equal to the minimum possible downvotes (1), which falls under the `?` condition but is handled implicitly by the first two conditions not being met. 

Finally, in the example where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the code correctly prints `?` because the outcome is uncertain, depending on how the unknown person votes.

Given the provided code and the logic it implements, it correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
