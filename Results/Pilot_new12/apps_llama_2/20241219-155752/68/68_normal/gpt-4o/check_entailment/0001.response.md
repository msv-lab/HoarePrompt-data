Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles the possible outcomes of the votes and prints the result accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

- It first reads the input values `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.
- It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by considering the unknown votes.
- The program checks two conditions:
  - If the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes, it means that Nauuo will definitely get more downvotes than upvotes, so it prints '-'.
  - If the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes, it means that Nauuo will definitely get more upvotes than downvotes, so it prints '+'.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the outcome is uncertain, so it prints '?'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It also handles edge cases, such as when `x`, `y`, or `z` is 0.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
