The function accepts three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input, where `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. After execution, the function will have printed one of three possible characters to the console: `-` if the maximum possible upvotes (`x + z`) are less than the minimum possible downvotes (`y`), `+` if the maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`) are less than the minimum possible upvotes (`x`), or `?` if neither of the above conditions are met. The function does not modify the input values or return any value, and its purpose is to provide a simple classification based on the input integers.
