The code assigns the value of `x` to `min_upvotes`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z. 

The states of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected. 
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, so `min_upvotes` equals `x`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z and `min_upvotes` equals `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z and `min_upvotes` equals `x`.**
