The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, and `max_upvotes` are not changed by this operation. 

`min_upvotes` remains equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` remains equal to `x + z`. 

The states of `x`, `y`, and `z` as input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z are not affected.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`**
