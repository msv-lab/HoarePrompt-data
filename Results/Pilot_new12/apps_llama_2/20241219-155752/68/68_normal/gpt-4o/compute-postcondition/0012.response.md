Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`; `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`; and `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then '+' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, then '?' has been printed.***
