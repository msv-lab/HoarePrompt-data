The code provided simply prints a '+' character. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`; `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`; and '+' has been printed**
