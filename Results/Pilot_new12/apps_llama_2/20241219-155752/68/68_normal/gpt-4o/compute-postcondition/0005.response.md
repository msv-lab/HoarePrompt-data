Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; the current value of `min_upvotes` equals `x`; the current value of `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; the current value of `min_downvotes` equals `y`; the current value of `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`. Additionally, the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.**
