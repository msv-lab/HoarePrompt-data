Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`; `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`. If `x + z < y`, then no action has been taken. Otherwise, if `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`, then either '+' has been printed if `y + z < x`, or '?' has been printed if `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
