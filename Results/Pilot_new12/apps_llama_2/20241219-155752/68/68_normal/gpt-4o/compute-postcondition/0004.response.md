The code sets `max_downvotes` to `y + z`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` are still valid. `min_upvotes` equals `x`, `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` equals `y`. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`; `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`**
