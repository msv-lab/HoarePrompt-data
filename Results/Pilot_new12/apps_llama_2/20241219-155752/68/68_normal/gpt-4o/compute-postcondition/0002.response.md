To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z and `min_upvotes` equals `x`.

The code is: `max_upvotes = x + z`

This line of code assigns the sum of `x` and `z` to the variable `max_upvotes`. 

Given that `x` and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, z), `max_upvotes` will be a non-negative integer as well, and its value will be equal to `x + z`.

The states of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `min_upvotes` are not changed by this code. `min_upvotes` remains equal to `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`**
