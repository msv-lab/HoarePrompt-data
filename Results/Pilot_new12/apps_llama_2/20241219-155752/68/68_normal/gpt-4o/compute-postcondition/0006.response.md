The code provided simply prints a hyphen (-) to the console. This operation does not modify the values of any variables. 

Given the initial state: `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; the current value of `min_upvotes` equals `x`; the current value of `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; the current value of `min_downvotes` equals `y`; the current value of `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`. Additionally, the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`, which implies `x + z < y`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. The condition that `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` also remains valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers such that 0 <= x, y, z; `min_upvotes` equals `x`; `max_upvotes` equals `x + z`; `min_downvotes` equals `y`; `max_downvotes` equals `y + z`; and `x + z < y`.**
