It seems like there is a mistake in the problem description. The function `func()` does not have any parameters, but the problem description mentions parameters x, y, and z. I'll assume that the function should have these parameters.


The function `func` accepts parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. However, the output of the function is not specified.


Since there is no output description, I can only describe the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z, which are non-negative integers between 0 and 100.**
