You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It accurately checks the three conditions: 
1. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.
2. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The program iterates through each instruction, updating the current latitude accordingly. It checks for invalid conditions after each instruction, such as moving south from the North Pole or north from the South Pole, and immediately prints 'NO' if any of these conditions are met. If the journey ends and the final latitude is not 90 (North Pole), the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program handles movements in a way that is consistent with the assumption that the Earth is a perfect sphere, where 1 degree of latitude is approximately equal to 111.195 kilometers. 

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and it appears to accurately implement the required logic. Without a specific counterexample, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a sequence of instructions where each instruction is a pair (t, dir) with t being an integer representing the distance to travel and dir being a string representing the direction of travel, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", "East". The sequence starts from the North Pole and consists of n instructions, where n is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The distance t for each instruction is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 0 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is the final latitude after updating the original value of 90 based on the directions and distances of travel, unless the program has exited and printed 'NO' due to `curr_lat` being outside the valid range or reaching a boundary latitude with an invalid direction.
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sequence of instructions where each instruction is a pair of distance and direction, processes these instructions starting from the North Pole, and determines whether the final latitude is back at the North Pole (90 degrees) or not. The function takes into account the distance and direction of travel, updating the latitude accordingly, and checks for invalid movements such as traveling beyond the valid latitude range (-90 to 90 degrees) or reaching a boundary latitude with an invalid direction. If any invalid movement is detected, the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, after processing all instructions, the function prints 'YES' if the final latitude is 90 degrees (i.e., back at the North Pole) and 'NO' otherwise. The function ignores any instructions with a direction other than 'North' or 'South'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
