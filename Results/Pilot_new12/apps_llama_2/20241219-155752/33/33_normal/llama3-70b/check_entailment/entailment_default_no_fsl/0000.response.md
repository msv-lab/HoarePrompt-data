Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately simulates Limak's journey and checks for the three conditions specified: 

1. If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move south.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move north.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The code initializes the current latitude to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole. It then processes each instruction, updating the latitude based on the direction and distance traveled. The code checks for invalid movements, such as traveling beyond the valid latitude range (-90 to 90 degrees) or reaching a boundary latitude with an invalid direction. If any invalid movement is detected, the code immediately prints 'NO' and exits.

The code correctly handles the examples provided, including the edge cases where Limak travels to the South Pole and back to the North Pole, or where he travels to the South Pole but does not return to the North Pole.

The function ignores any instructions with a direction other than 'North' or 'South', which is consistent with the problem description. This is because the Earth is a perfect sphere, and traveling east or west does not change the latitude.

Overall, the code provides a correct and efficient solution to the problem, handling all possible cases and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
