Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of instructions `n` and initializing the current latitude `curr_lat` to 90, representing the North Pole.

2. **Instruction Processing**: The program then iterates over each instruction, processing the distance `t` and direction `dir`. It updates the `curr_lat` based on the direction of travel.

3. **Boundary Checks**: The program checks if the `curr_lat` is outside the valid range of -90 to 90. If it is, the program prints 'NO' and exits.

4. **Pole Direction Checks**: The program also checks if the current latitude is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`) and the direction is not 'South', or if the current latitude is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`) and the direction is not 'North'. If either condition is met, the program prints 'NO' and exits.

5. **Final Check**: After processing all instructions, the program checks if the final `curr_lat` is 90, representing the North Pole. If it is, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem description:

- It checks for valid directions at the poles.
- It ensures the journey ends at the North Pole.
- It handles all possible directions and distances.

The assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program is also met, as stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
