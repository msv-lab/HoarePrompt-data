Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program initializes the current latitude to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole.
2. It then iterates through the input instructions, updating the current latitude based on the direction and distance of each move.
3. The program checks if the current latitude is outside the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees and exits with 'NO' if so.
4. It also checks if the bear is at the North Pole (curr_lat == 90) and attempts to move in a direction other than South, or if it's at the South Pole (curr_lat == -90) and attempts to move in a direction other than North. If either condition is met, it exits with 'NO'.
5. Finally, the program checks if the bear ends up back at the North Pole after all instructions have been executed and prints 'YES' if so, or 'NO' otherwise.

The program handles all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly. The conversion factor of 111.195 is used to convert kilometers to degrees of latitude, which is a reasonable approximation for the Earth's surface.

After analyzing the program and considering various potential cases, no examples were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
