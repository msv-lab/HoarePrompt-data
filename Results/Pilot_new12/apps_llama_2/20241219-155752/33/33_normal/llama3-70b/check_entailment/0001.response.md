Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It accurately checks the three conditions: 
1. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.
2. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The program iterates through each instruction, updating the current latitude accordingly. It checks for invalid conditions after each instruction, such as moving south from the North Pole or north from the South Pole, and immediately prints 'NO' if any of these conditions are met. If the journey ends and the final latitude is not 90 (North Pole), the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program handles movements in a way that is consistent with the assumption that the Earth is a perfect sphere, where 1 degree of latitude is approximately equal to 111.195 kilometers. 

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and it appears to accurately implement the required logic. Without a specific counterexample, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct based on the provided problem description.
