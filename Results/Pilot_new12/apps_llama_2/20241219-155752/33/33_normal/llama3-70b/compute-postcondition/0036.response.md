Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], the program continues execution with the specified updates to `curr_lat` based on `dir`. If `curr_lat` exceeds 90 or is less than -90, the program terminates after printing 'NO' and no further execution occurs.***
