The code converts the variable `t` to an integer using the `int()` function. The initial state specifies that `t` is the first part of the input, so `t` is now an integer representation of the first part of the input. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is 90, `_` is 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input**
