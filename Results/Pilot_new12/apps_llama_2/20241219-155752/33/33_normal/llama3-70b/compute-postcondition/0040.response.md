The code prints 'NO' to the output, which indicates that the program has terminated. The reason for this termination is that `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'. 

Output State: **The program has printed 'NO' and terminated, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` is -90, which is out of the valid range.**
