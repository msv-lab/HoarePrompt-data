The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately, so no further calculations are performed. The values of the variables do not change, but the program ends. The `exit()` function does not return any value, it just stops the execution of the program. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is 90, and the current value of `dir` is not 'South'. 'NO' has been printed. The program has been terminated.**
