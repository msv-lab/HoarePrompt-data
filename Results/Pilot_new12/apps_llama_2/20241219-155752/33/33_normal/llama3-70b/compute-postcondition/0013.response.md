Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` remains 90.***
