Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the program has printed 'NO' and terminated, with `curr_lat` being out of the valid range. Otherwise, the program continues execution with `curr_lat` within the range [-90, 90].***
