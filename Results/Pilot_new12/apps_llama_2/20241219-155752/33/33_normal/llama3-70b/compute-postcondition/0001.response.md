The initial state is: The sequence starts from the North Pole, consists of `n` instructions where `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and each instruction is a pair (t, dir) with t being an integer representing the distance to travel and dir being a string representing the direction of travel, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", "East", and the distance t for each instruction is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive, and `n` is the number of these instructions.

The value of `curr_lat` is set to 90. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: The sequence starts from the North Pole, consists of `n` instructions where `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and each instruction is a pair (t, dir) with t being an integer representing the distance to travel and dir being a string representing the direction of travel, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", "East", and the distance t for each instruction is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive, and `n` is the number of these instructions, `curr_lat` is 90.

Output State: **The sequence starts from the North Pole, consists of `n` instructions where `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and each instruction is a pair (t, dir) with t being an integer representing the distance to travel and dir being a string representing the direction of travel, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", "East", and the distance t for each instruction is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive, and `n` is the number of these instructions, `curr_lat` is 90**
