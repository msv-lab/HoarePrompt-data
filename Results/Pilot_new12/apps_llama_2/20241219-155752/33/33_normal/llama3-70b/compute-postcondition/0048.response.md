The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive
- `_` equals 2
- `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer
- `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]
- `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input

The `continue` statement does not affect any of these variables. It only skips to the next iteration of the loop, if there is one.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
