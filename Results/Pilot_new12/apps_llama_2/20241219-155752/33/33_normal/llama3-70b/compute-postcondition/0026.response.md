According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the new state of `_` should be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90. If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', then 'NO' has been printed, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution with `curr_lat` within the range [-90, 90], and if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then 'NO' has been printed, and the program has terminated.**
