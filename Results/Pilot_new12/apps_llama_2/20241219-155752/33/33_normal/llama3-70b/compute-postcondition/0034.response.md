The given code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the string 'NO' has been printed. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `_`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged because the print statement does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90], if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `90 + 2t / 111.195` if it doesn't exceed 90, otherwise `curr_lat` is 90, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - 2t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` is either `90 + t / 111.195` if it doesn't exceed 90 or remains as it was originally, the string 'NO' has been printed, and the program may terminate if `curr_lat` exceeds 90 or if the conditions for termination are met.**
