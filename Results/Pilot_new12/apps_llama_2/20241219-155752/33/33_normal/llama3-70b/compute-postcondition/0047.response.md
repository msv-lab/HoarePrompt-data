The value of `curr_lat` is updated by subtracting `t / 111.195` from it. The value of `t` is an integer, and the value of `curr_lat` was within the range [-90, 90]. After the update, `curr_lat` is equal to its previous value minus `t / 111.195`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `curr_lat` is `curr_lat` - `t / 111.195`, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input**
