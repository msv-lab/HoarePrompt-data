To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- The current value of `curr_lat` is 90.
- The current value of `_` is 0.
- `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input.
- `dir` is the second part of the input, and it is not 'North'.
- The current value of `dir` is 'South'.

The code provided is:
```python
curr_lat -= t / 111.195
```
This line of code subtracts the result of `t / 111.195` from the current value of `curr_lat`.

Given that `curr_lat` initially is 90, and `t` is an integer representation of some input (though the exact value or range of `t` is not specified, it's implied to be related to the input that also defines `dir`), we can say that `curr_lat` will be decreased by a fraction of `t`. Since `t` is an integer and `111.195` is a constant, `t / 111.195` will result in a floating-point number. 

Without the exact value of `t`, we cannot determine the precise new value of `curr_lat`, but we can express it as `90 - t / 111.195`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `_`, `t`, `dir`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` is 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'South', and `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` is 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'South', and `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`**
