The given code prints 'NO'. This indicates that either `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', or `curr_lat` is updated and then becomes either less than -90 or greater than 90. 

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input. 

If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated. 

If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. 

The code `print('NO')` does not change any variable values, but it does indicate that the program has encountered an invalid condition and is terminating. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated.**
