Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, if `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the program has printed 'NO' and terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution with its current state intact, given that it hasn't terminated due to `curr_lat` being out of the valid range earlier, and `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90] if the program continues.**
