The code prints 'NO' to the console, indicating that the program has terminated due to `curr_lat` exceeding 90 or being less than -90. The values of `n`, `_`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by this code snippet. However, the program terminates after printing 'NO', so no further execution occurs.


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, the program has printed 'NO' and terminated, `curr_lat` is either greater than 90 or less than -90.**
