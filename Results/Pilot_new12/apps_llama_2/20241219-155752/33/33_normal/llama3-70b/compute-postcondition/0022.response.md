Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is 90, and the current value of `dir` is not 'South'. The program has not terminated, implying that `curr_lat` is not -90 when `dir` is not 'North', thus `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] with the specific value of 90 when entering this condition.**
