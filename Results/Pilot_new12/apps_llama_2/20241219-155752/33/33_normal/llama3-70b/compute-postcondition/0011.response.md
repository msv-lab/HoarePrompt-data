The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is 90, `_` is 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, `dir` is not 'North', and `dir` is not 'South', and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
