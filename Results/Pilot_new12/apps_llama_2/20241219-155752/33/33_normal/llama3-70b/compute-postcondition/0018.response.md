Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is -90 and the current value of `dir` is not 'North'. The program has not been terminated and 'NO' has not been printed, indicating that the previous value of `curr_lat` was within the range [-90, 90] before any potential changes, but given the current value of `curr_lat` is exactly -90, it is at the boundary of this range.**
