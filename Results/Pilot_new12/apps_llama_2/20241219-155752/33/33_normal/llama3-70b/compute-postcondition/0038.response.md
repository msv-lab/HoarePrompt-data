The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. This means that the program stops executing and no further code is run. The values of the variables do not change, but the program terminates.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, the program has printed 'NO' and terminated, `curr_lat` is either greater than 90 or less than -90, and the program has been terminated using `exit()`.**
