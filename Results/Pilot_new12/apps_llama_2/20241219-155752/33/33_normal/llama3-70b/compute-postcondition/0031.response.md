The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, if `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90, and if `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', or `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then the program may terminate in the following lines of code, `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90], and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
