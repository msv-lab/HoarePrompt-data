The given Python code is executing the line `t = int(t)`. This operation converts the value of `t` into an integer. 

Given that `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, this conversion does not change its value because `t` is already an integer representation. 

The other variables are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain the same. Hence, the final output state remains the same as before, except that `t` is explicitly confirmed to be an integer, which was already implied by the initial condition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, if `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90, and if `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', or `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then the program may terminate in the following lines of code, `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90].**
