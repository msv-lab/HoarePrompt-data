Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90. If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', then 'NO' has been printed, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues execution with `curr_lat` within the range [-90, 90], and if `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then 'NO' has been printed, and the program has terminated.***
