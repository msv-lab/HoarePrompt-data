The code `t, dir = input().split()` takes an input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `t` and the second part to `dir`. 

Since `t` was previously an integer and now it is assigned the first part of the split input, `t` becomes a string equal to the first part of the input.

The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. 
The value of `_` is still equal to 2.
The value of `curr_lat` is still within the range [-90, 90].
The value of `dir` is now a string equal to the second part of the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is a string equal to the first part of the input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input**
