To calculate the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
- `_` equals 2.
- `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer.
- `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90].
- `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input.

Given Code:
```python
curr_lat += t / 111.195
```

The impact of this code on the program is that it updates the value of `curr_lat` by adding the result of dividing `t` by 111.195 to it.

The value of `t` is an integer, and it's divided by 111.195, which means the result of `t / 111.195` will be a floating-point number. This value is then added to `curr_lat`, which was initially within the range [-90, 90]. The new value of `curr_lat` will depend on the initial value of `curr_lat` and the value of `t`.

Since `t` can vary (it's the first part of the input converted to an integer), the exact new range or value of `curr_lat` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `t`. However, we can express the new value of `curr_lat` as `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.

Other variables (`n`, `_`, `t`, and `dir`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input**
