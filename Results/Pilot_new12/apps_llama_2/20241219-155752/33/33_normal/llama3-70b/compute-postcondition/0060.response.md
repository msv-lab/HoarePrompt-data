To calculate the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code updates the `curr_lat` variable based on the direction and distance of travel. If the direction is 'North', it adds the distance divided by 111.195 to `curr_lat`. If the direction is 'South', it subtracts the distance divided by 111.195 from `curr_lat`. If the direction is neither 'North' nor 'South', it skips the update.

The loop also checks if `curr_lat` is within the valid range of [-90, 90] after each update. If `curr_lat` is outside this range, it prints 'NO' and exits the program. Additionally, if `curr_lat` is 90 and the direction is not 'South', or if `curr_lat` is -90 and the direction is not 'North', it prints 'NO' and exits the program.

Based on the loop code and the given output states, we can deduce the following:

* If the loop executes at least once, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
* The final value of `curr_lat` is the result of updating the original value of `curr_lat` (which is 90) based on the directions and distances of travel.
* If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), the value of `curr_lat` remains 90.
* The loop will exit and print 'NO' if `curr_lat` is outside the valid range of [-90, 90] or if it reaches the boundary of 90 degrees latitude when moving north or -90 degrees latitude when moving south, unless the direction is 'South' or 'North', respectively.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is the final latitude after updating the original value of 90 based on the directions and distances of travel, unless the program has exited and printed 'NO' due to `curr_lat` being outside the valid range or reaching a boundary latitude with an invalid direction.**
