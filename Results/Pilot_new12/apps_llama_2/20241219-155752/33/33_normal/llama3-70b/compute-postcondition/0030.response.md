To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables, especially `curr_lat`, and then determine how the other variables are affected, if at all.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
- `_` equals 1.
- `t` is an integer.
- `dir` is the second part of the input, which can be 'North', 'South', or neither.
- The original value of `curr_lat` depends on `dir`: if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`; if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`; if `dir` is neither, then `curr_lat` was 90.
- `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90].

The code provided is:
```python
curr_lat -= t / 111.195
```

This code subtracts `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. 

1. If `dir` is 'North', the original `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. After subtraction, `curr_lat` becomes `90 + t / 111.195 - t / 111.195 = 90`.
2. If `dir` is 'South', the original `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. After subtraction, `curr_lat` becomes `90 - t / 111.195 - t / 111.195 = 90 - 2t / 111.195`.
3. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', the original `curr_lat` was 90. After subtraction, `curr_lat` becomes `90 - t / 111.195`.

The states of `n`, `_`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by this operation. However, the value of `curr_lat` changes based on the initial conditions and the value of `t`.

Therefore, considering all possible initial conditions for `dir` and the effect of the code on `curr_lat`:
- If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` becomes 90.
- If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` becomes `90 - 2t / 111.195`.
- If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` becomes `90 - t / 111.195`.

Given that `curr_lat` must remain within the range [-90, 90], the new value of `curr_lat` will be within this range, but its exact value depends on the initial `dir` and the value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is 90, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - 2t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`, and `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90].**
