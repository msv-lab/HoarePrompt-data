Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the original value of `curr_lat` was 90. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], the program continues execution. If `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated.***
