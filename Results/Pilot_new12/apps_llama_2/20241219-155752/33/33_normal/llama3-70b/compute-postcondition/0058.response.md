The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops executing and exits. 

The variables `n`, `_`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` and the fact that 'NO' has been printed are not affected by the `exit()` function because the program has already terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, the program has been terminated, and the program execution has stopped due to the `exit()` function being called and a value of None has been returned at the output state.**
