Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - 2t / 111.195`, otherwise `curr_lat` remains as it was, with its original value being either `90 + t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'North', `90 - t / 111.195` if `dir` is 'South' but changed to the next iteration, or 90 if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', and in all cases `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90].**
