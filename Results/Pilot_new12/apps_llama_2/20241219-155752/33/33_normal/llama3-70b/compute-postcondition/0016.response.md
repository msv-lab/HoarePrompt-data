The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. This means that the execution of the program stops, and no further code is executed. The values of the variables when the program exits are: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. 

If `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`, 
if `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`, 
if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was 90. 

`curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, and 'NO' has been printed. 

The `exit()` function does not change any variable's value; it just stops the execution of the program, so all the variables keep their values, and no new variables are introduced. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, if `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was 90, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated**
