The code print('NO') simply prints the string 'NO' and does not change the values of any variables. However, according to the initial state, if the program has reached this point, it means that `curr_lat` was updated and it is now outside the range [-90, 90]. 
The value of `curr_lat` can be either less than -90 or greater than 90.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed**
