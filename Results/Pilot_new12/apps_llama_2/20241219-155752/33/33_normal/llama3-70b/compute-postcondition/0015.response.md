The given code snippet prints 'NO' to the console, but it does not modify any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced. 

The initial state conditions are still valid after the code has been executed, so `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90. Also, 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, if `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 + t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was `90 - t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the current value of `curr_lat` was 90, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, and 'NO' has been printed.**
