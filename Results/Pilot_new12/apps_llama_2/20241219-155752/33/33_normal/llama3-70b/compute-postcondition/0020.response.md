The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. 

The states of the variables `n`, `_`, `t`, `curr_lat`, and `dir` are not affected, and 'NO' has been printed. 

The program has stopped running, so there is no further execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `curr_lat` is -90, `dir` is not 'North', 'NO' has been printed, and the program has terminated.**
