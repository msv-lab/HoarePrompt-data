The given code prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` is equal to 90, and 'NO' otherwise. Based on the initial state, `n` is an integer between 0 and 50, inclusive, and `curr_lat` is the final latitude after updating the original value of 90.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is the final latitude, and the program has printed 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise it has printed 'NO'.**
