According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `curr_lat` is 90. 
For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, it meets this condition. The loop counter variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, we should still acknowledge its existence and that it will take values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop iterations. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is 90, `_` is 0**
