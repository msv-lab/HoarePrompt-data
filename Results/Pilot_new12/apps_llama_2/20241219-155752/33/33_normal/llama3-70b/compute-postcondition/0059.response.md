Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] after the update, the program continues. If `curr_lat` equals 90 and `dir` is not 'South', then `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' has been printed, the program has been terminated, and the program execution has stopped due to the `exit()` function being called and a value of None has been returned at the output state. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged with respect to `curr_lat` being at the boundary of 90 degrees latitude when moving north.**
