The value of `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to it. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90. The value of `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, the current value of `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'North'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `curr_lat` is `90 + t / 111.195`, `_` equals 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'North'**
