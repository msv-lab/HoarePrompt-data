Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first part of the input converted to an integer, `dir` is a string equal to the second part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195`. Otherwise, the state of `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90].***
