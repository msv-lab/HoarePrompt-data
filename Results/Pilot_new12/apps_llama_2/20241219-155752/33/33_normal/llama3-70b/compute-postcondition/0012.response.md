Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `_` is 0, `t` is the integer representation of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, and `dir` is not 'North'. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `90 - t / 111.195`. If `dir` is not 'South', then `curr_lat` remains 90 and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
