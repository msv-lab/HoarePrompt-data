The code `exit()` terminates the program. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `_` equals 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input, `curr_lat` remains within the range [-90, 90], if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is `90 + 2t / 111.195` if it doesn't exceed 90, otherwise `curr_lat` is 90, if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - 2t / 111.195`, if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` is either `90 + t / 111.195` if it doesn't exceed 90 or remains as it was originally, the string 'NO' has been printed, the program has terminated, and no further execution will occur.**
