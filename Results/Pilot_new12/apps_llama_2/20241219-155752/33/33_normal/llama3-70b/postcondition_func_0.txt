The function accepts a sequence of instructions where each instruction is a pair of distance and direction, processes these instructions starting from the North Pole, and determines whether the final latitude is back at the North Pole (90 degrees) or not. The function takes into account the distance and direction of travel, updating the latitude accordingly, and checks for invalid movements such as traveling beyond the valid latitude range (-90 to 90 degrees) or reaching a boundary latitude with an invalid direction. If any invalid movement is detected, the function immediately prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, after processing all instructions, the function prints 'YES' if the final latitude is 90 degrees (i.e., back at the North Pole) and 'NO' otherwise. The function ignores any instructions with a direction other than 'North' or 'South'.
