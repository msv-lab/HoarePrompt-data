Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input. If `dir` is 'North', then `position` is `position - t`, and `valid` is `False` if `position` is less than 0, otherwise `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is either `position + t` if `position + t` is not greater than 20000, or 20000 if `position + t` is greater than 20000. If `position` is 0 and `dir` is 'South', then `valid` is either its previous value if `position + t` is not greater than 20000, or `False` if `position + t` is greater than 20000. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then if `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `valid` is `False` if `position` is 0, otherwise `valid` remains unchanged and `position`, `t`, `dir`, and `n` retain their initial values. After the if-else block, `valid` is `False` if `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, otherwise the previous conditions hold.**
