The value of `valid` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, `position` depends on the previous state and the updated `dir`, and `valid` is `False`.
