The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

The initial state specifies that the input is a sequence of `n` pairs of values where `n` is a positive integer. After executing the code, the value of `n` is determined and is equal to the input integer.

Output State: **Input is a sequence of `n` pairs of values where `n` is a positive integer equal to `int(input())`, each pair consisting of a non-negative integer `t` representing the length of a journey in kilometers (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6), and a string `dir` representing the direction of the journey, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".**
