The value of `valid` is directly set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, the current value of `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000 and is not equal to 0, and `valid` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000 and is not equal to 0, and `valid` is `False`**
