Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` is unchanged, still depending on the previous state and the updated `dir`.***
