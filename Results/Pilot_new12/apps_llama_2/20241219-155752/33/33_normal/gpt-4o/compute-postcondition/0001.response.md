The code initializes a variable `position` to 0. The initial state provides information about the input sequence and its characteristics, but it does not directly impact the value of `position`. The input sequence consists of `n` pairs of values, where `n` is a positive integer, each pair containing a non-negative integer `t` and a string `dir`. However, the code snippet provided does not utilize this input sequence in any way that affects the variable `position`. 

Given this context, the only variable directly affected by the code is `position`, which is set to 0. The characteristics of the input sequence, including the value of `n`, the range of `t`, and the possible values of `dir`, remain unchanged and do not influence the outcome of the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `int(input())`, each pair of the input sequence consists of a non-negative integer `t` and a string `dir`, and `position` is 0**
