Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is not 'North' and not 'South'. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged, and `position`, `t`, `dir`, and `n` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition, given that there are no changes specified for `position` not being 0 or 20000 in the if part, and there is no else part to modify the state when `dir` is not 'West' or 'East'.**
