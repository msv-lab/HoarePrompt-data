The value of `valid` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `position` minus `t` is still less than 0, which implies `position` is less than `t`. The value of `dir` is still 'North', and `n` is still a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'North', `position` is less than `t`, `valid` is `False`**
