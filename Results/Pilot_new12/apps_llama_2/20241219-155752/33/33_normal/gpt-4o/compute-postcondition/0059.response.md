Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `position` and `valid` depend on the previous state and the updated `dir`: if `dir` is 'North', then `position` is `position - t`, and if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `position` remains unchanged, but if `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is neither 'North', 'South', 'West', nor 'East', the state of the program variables remains unchanged, still depending on the previous state and the updated `dir`.***
