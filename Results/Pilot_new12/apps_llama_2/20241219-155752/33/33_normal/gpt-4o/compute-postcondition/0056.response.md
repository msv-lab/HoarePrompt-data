Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`; otherwise, the state of `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is not 'South', then if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `position` and `valid` remain unchanged unless `position` is 0 or 20000, in which case `valid` is `False`; if `dir` is neither 'South', 'West', nor 'East', the state of the program variables remains unchanged, still depending on the previous state and the updated `dir`.***
