According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `position` is 0, and `valid` is `True`. Since `n` is already a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the loop execution. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`**
