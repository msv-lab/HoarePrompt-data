The function `func` accepts a sequence of n pairs of values. Each pair consists of a non-negative integer `t` representing the length of a journey in kilometers and a string `dir` representing the direction of the journey. 

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not explicitly show the parameters. In a typical Python function that processes such input, we would expect to see something like `def func(pairs):` where `pairs` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer and a string. Based on the given description of the input, we'll proceed under the assumption that such a structure is intended, even if not explicitly shown.

Given the sequence of journeys with their lengths and directions, the function would process this information and produce an output. However, the specific output or return value of the function is not provided in the given problem statement.

Therefore, without specific details on the output, the functionality of the function can be described in terms of its input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence of pairs of values representing journeys, where each pair consists of a non-negative integer for the journey length and a string for the direction, and processes this information to produce an unspecified output.**
