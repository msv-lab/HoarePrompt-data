Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, `position` retains its value from the last iteration. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`, otherwise the value of `valid` is unchanged. If `dir` is not 'West' or 'East', the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
