The code sets the value of `valid` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `position` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'South', and `position + t` is greater than 20000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `position` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'South', and `position + t` is greater than 20000**
