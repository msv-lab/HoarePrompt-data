Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000. If `position` is not equal to 0, `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, the state of `valid` is unchanged. Additionally, `valid` is `False`.**
