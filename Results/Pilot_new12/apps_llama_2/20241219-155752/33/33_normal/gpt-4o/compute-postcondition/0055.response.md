Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`; otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` remains unchanged, still depending on the previous state and the updated `dir`. If `dir` is not 'West' or 'East', the state of the program variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this case.**
