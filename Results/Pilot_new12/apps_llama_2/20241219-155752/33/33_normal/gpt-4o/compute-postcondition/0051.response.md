Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, `position` depends on the previous state and the updated `dir`. If `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`; otherwise, the state of `valid` is not updated by this if statement.**
