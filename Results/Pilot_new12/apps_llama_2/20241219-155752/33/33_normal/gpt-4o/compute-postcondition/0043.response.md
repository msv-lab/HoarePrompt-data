Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the current iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, `position` retains its previous value and `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` depends on the previous state and `dir`: if `dir` is 'North', then `position` is `position - t`, and if the new `position` is less than 0, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then `position` retains its value from the last iteration, but if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`. For any other direction, the state of the variables remains unchanged, except that `valid` remains unchanged if `dir` is not 'North', 'South', 'West', or 'East', or if the movement does not cause `position` to be out of bounds.***
