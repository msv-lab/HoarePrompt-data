The value of `position` is decreased by `t`, which is the integer value of the first part of the input. The states of the other variables are not affected. The new value of `position` is `position - t`. 

If the original `position` is less than `t`, then `valid` is `False`. After decreasing `position` by `t`, it will be even less than before, so if `valid` was `False` before, it will still be `False` after the decrease. If the original `position` is not less than `t`, then the state of `valid` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'North', `position` is `position - t`, and if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `valid` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is 'North', `position` is `position - t`, and if `position` is less than `t`, then `valid` is `False`, otherwise `valid` remains unchanged.**
