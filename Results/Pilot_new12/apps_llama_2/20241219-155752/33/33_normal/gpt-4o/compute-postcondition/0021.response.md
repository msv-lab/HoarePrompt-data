Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. If `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `valid` is unchanged, but since there is no else part, the program doesn't specify any changes to the state when `position` is not 0 or 20000, so `position`, `t`, `dir`, and `n` remain as they were initially, given the precondition and the specified if part***
