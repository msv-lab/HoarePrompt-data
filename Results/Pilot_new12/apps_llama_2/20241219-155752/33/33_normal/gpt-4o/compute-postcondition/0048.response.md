Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the next iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, if `position` - `t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`, otherwise the state of `valid` and the updated `position` depend on the previous state and the updated `dir`.**
