Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the current iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is `position + t`, and if `position + t` is greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is not 'South', then `position` retains its value from the last iteration. Additionally, if `dir` is 'West' or 'East' and `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`, otherwise the value of `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is neither 'South', 'West', nor 'East', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
