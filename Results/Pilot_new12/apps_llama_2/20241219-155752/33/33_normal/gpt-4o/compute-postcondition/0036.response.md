The code increments the `position` by `t`. The previous value of `position` is retained from the last iteration. 

`n` is still a positive integer greater than the current iteration. 
`dir` is still the second part of the input. 
`t` is still the integer value of the first part of the input.

`position` is now `position + t`. 

If `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Since `position` is now `position + t`, we need to check if the new `position` is greater than 20000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, `position` is `position + t`, if `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`**
