Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly checks for the three conditions:

1. If Limak is on the North Pole, he can only move South.
2. If Limak is on the South Pole, he can only move North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The program achieves this through the following logic:

- It maintains a `position` variable to track Limak's current position, starting from the North Pole (`position = 0`).
- For each movement, it checks the direction and updates the `position` accordingly. If the movement would take Limak outside the bounds of the globe (i.e., `position < 0` or `position > 20000`), or if Limak tries to move West or East from the North or South Pole, it marks the journey as invalid (`valid = False`).
- After all movements, it checks if the final `position` is back at the North Pole (`position == 0`). If not, or if any previous checks marked the journey as invalid, it prints "NO", indicating the journey description does not satisfy the conditions. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Given the assumptions of valid input, the program handles all specified cases correctly. It checks for each movement to ensure compliance with the rules and ends the journey at the North Pole as required. Thus, it accurately follows the problem description and is considered correct.
