You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

20000 South
1000 North

20000 North

Output
NO

Input

50 North
15000 South
15000 North

Output
YES



-----Note-----

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Input is a sequence of n pairs of values where n is a positive integer, each pair consisting of a non-negative integer t representing the length of a journey in kilometers (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a string dir representing the direction of the journey, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000, and `valid` is `True` if all movements were valid, `False` otherwise.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000. If `position` is not equal to 0, `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, the state of `valid` is unchanged, as there is no else part to modify it.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000. If `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`. If `position` is not 0, `valid` is `False` and 'NO' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sequence of pairs of values representing journeys, where each pair consists of a non-negative integer for the journey length and a string for the direction, which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". It processes this information to determine if a series of movements, where each movement is within the bounds of 0 to 20000, results in a final position of 0 and if all movements are valid according to the given rules. The function prints 'YES' to the console if the final position is 0 and all movements are valid; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function considers the following edge cases: it checks for valid directions, ensures that movements do not exceed the bounds of 0 to 20000, and verifies that movements in "West" or "East" directions do not occur when the position is 0 or 20000. The final state of the program includes the console output ('YES' or 'NO') based on the validity of the movements and the final position.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
