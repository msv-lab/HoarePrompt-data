You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly checks if the description of Limak's journey satisfies the three conditions: 

1. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.
2. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The program uses a variable `position` to keep track of Limak's current position, with 0 representing the North Pole and 20000 representing the South Pole. It then iterates over each part of the journey, updating the position based on the direction and distance. 

The program checks for the following conditions:

- If the direction is 'North' and moving in this direction would take Limak beyond the North Pole, it sets `valid` to `False`.
- If the direction is 'South' and moving in this direction would take Limak beyond the South Pole, it sets `valid` to `False`.
- If the direction is 'West' or 'East' and Limak is at the North Pole or South Pole, it sets `valid` to `False`, because at these poles, moving west or east is not allowed.
- If the final position is not the North Pole, it sets `valid` to `False`.

If all conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program handles all the provided examples correctly and does not seem to have any edge cases that are not handled. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Input is a sequence of n pairs of values where n is a positive integer, each pair consisting of a non-negative integer t representing the length of a journey in kilometers (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a string dir representing the direction of the journey, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000, and `valid` is `True` if all movements were valid, `False` otherwise.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000. If `position` is not equal to 0, `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, the state of `valid` is unchanged, as there is no else part to modify it.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values, `position` is the final position after all movements within the bounds 0 to 20000. If `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`. If `position` is not 0, `valid` is `False` and 'NO' has been printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
