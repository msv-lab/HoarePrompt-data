Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Initial Position and Movement Validation**: The program starts with the assumption that Limak is at the North Pole, represented by a position of 0. It then checks each movement direction and distance. For 'North' and 'South' movements, it updates the position accordingly and checks if the new position is within the valid range (0 to 20000). 

2. **North Pole Condition**: The program enforces the condition that if Limak is at the North Pole (position 0), the only valid movement is to the 'South'. This is achieved by immediately setting `valid` to `False` if a 'North', 'West', or 'East' movement is attempted when the position is 0.

3. **South Pole Condition**: Similarly, if Limak is at the South Pole (position 20000), the only valid movement is to the 'North'. This is also correctly enforced by setting `valid` to `False` if a 'South', 'West', or 'East' movement is attempted when the position is 20000.

4. **Ending at the North Pole**: After all movements have been processed, the program checks if the final position is 0, meaning Limak has ended back at the North Pole. If not, it sets `valid` to `False`.

5. **Final Output**: The program prints 'YES' if all conditions were met (`valid` is still `True`), and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the assumptions about valid input, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It checks the validity of movements based on the current position, ensures the journey ends at the North Pole, and reports the outcome accordingly.
