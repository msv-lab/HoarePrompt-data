Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the rules specified in the problem description. It correctly handles movements in the "North", "South", "West", and "East" directions and checks for the conditions that Limak is on the North Pole or South Pole to restrict movements accordingly. The code also verifies that the final position is back at the North Pole and prints 'YES' if all conditions are met, otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The code processes each movement step by step, updating the position based on the direction and distance of the movement. It checks for invalid movements, such as moving "West" or "East" when at either pole, and ensures that the position remains within the bounds of 0 to 20000. The final check for the position being back at 0 (the North Pole) before printing the result ensures that the journey ends as required.

The output hints agree with the code, describing the functionality and edge cases considered. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code, demonstrating its correctness for the given scenarios.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the code is robust in handling the expected inputs and scenarios, making it correct according to the specifications provided.
