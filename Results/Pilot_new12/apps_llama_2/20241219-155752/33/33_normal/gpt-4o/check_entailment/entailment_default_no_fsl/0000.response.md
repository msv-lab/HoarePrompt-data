Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle one of the conditions specified in the problem description. According to the problem, if Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South, and if he is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North. However, the code does not check this condition when the movement is initiated. 

In the code, it correctly checks the movement after the initial position is updated. However, it doesn't verify the direction at the initial step when the position is 0 (North Pole) or 20000 (South Pole). For instance, if Limak is at the North Pole (position 0) and the first direction is "North", the code will execute this move without checking if it's valid according to the rules. 

It should also be noted that the code does check for invalid movements in the "West" or "East" directions when the position is 0 or 20000 after each step, not before, which might seem correct at first glance but actually does not fully address the initial movement validation as specified in the problem. 

For a correct implementation, the code should check the movement direction before updating the position, especially considering the initial position and the first move. 

Here's a simple counterexample where the code will fail: 

Input:
3
0 North
0 East
0 South

The code will incorrectly validate the first two moves, which is against the rules. The correct output should be "NO" since moving "North" from the North Pole and moving "East" at the North Pole are not allowed according to the problem statement. 

This shows that the code does not adhere to the given problem description in every potential case, thus it is considered incorrect.
