The function accepts a sequence of pairs of values representing journeys, where each pair consists of a non-negative integer for the journey length and a string for the direction, which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". It processes this information to determine if a series of movements, where each movement is within the bounds of 0 to 20000, results in a final position of 0 and if all movements are valid according to the given rules. The function prints 'YES' to the console if the final position is 0 and all movements are valid; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function considers the following edge cases: it checks for valid directions, ensures that movements do not exceed the bounds of 0 to 20000, and verifies that movements in "West" or "East" directions do not occur when the position is 0 or 20000. The final state of the program includes the console output ('YES' or 'NO') based on the validity of the movements and the final position.
