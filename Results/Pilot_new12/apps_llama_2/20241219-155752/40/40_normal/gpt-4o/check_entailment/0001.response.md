Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, consider the string "abba". This string is a palindrome, but it has a substring "ab" which is not a palindrome and has a length of 2. However, the program will check the entire string, then the string without the first character ("bba"), then the string without the last character ("abb"), and since all these are not palindromes, it will print the length of the substring "bba" which is 3, but it should print the length of the longest non-palindrome substring "ab" or "ba" which is 2.

The issue is that the program only checks if the string or its prefixes/suffixes are palindromes, but it does not check all possible substrings. To fix this, the program should check all possible substrings of the string, not just the string itself and its prefixes/suffixes. 

In the case of the string "abba", the function should return 2, because "ab" and "ba" are the longest substrings that are not palindromes. However, the given function will return 3, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
