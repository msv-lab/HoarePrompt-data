Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. The input string `s` is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. If the length of `s` is 1 or less, the program prints 0, because a single-character string or an empty string is a palindrome.

3. The function `func_1(s)` checks whether a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If they are equal, the string is a palindrome and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. The program checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of `s`, because the longest non-palindrome substring of `s` is `s` itself.

5. If `s` is a palindrome, the program checks if the substring `s[1:]` (i.e., `s` without the first character) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of `s` minus 1, because `s[1:]` is the longest non-palindrome substring of `s`.

6. If both `s` and `s[1:]` are palindromes, the program checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (i.e., `s` without the last character) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of `s` minus 1, because `s[:-1]` is the longest non-palindrome substring of `s`.

7. If all of the above conditions are not met, it means that all substrings of `s` are palindromes, so the program prints 0.

The program handles all potential cases and correctly implements the problem description. It checks for the longest non-palindrome substring of the input string `s` and prints its length if such a substring exists; otherwise, it prints 0.
