You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given Python program does not work as expected in all cases. It checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome, and if it is not, it checks if the substrings `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` are palindromes. However, this approach is not sufficient to find the longest non-palindromic substring.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string is "abcdefabc". In this case, the program checks if the string is a palindrome, which it is not, so it returns the length of the string (`9`). However, it does not check all substrings of the string to ensure that it has found the longest non-palindromic substring.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate all substrings of the input string and check each one to see if it is a palindrome. If it finds any non-palindromic substring, it should keep track of the longest one found so far.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

s = input().strip()
max_length = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not is_palindrome(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```
This corrected version of the program checks all substrings of the input string and keeps track of the longest non-palindromic substring found.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the string `s` (a non-empty string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters) is a palindrome (`True`) or not (`False`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome. The function considers the input string as case-sensitive and only the exact sequence of characters is checked for palindrome property. It does not modify the input string, maintains its original case, and only checks if the string reads the same backward as forward. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, `False` otherwise, including empty strings, strings with non-alphabetic characters, and strings with lengths greater than 50 characters, although these cases are not explicitly documented in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
