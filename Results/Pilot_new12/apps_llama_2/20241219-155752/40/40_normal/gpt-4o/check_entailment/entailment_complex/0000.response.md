Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for the maximum length of the longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, the program should return 0.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

- It first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints 0 because a single-character string is a palindrome.
- It then checks if the string `s` is not a palindrome using the function `func_1`. If it's not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` because `s` itself is the longest non-palindromic substring.
- If `s` is a palindrome, it checks if the substring `s[1:]` (i.e., `s` without the first character) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1 because `s[1:]` is the longest non-palindromic substring.
- Similarly, it checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (i.e., `s` without the last character) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints the length of `s` minus 1.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it means that all substrings of `s` are palindromes, so it prints 0.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.

This program will work correctly for all valid inputs because it checks all possible cases:

- If the input string is not a palindrome, it will return the length of the longest non-palindromic substring.
- If the input string is a palindrome but has a non-palindromic substring, it will return the length of the longest non-palindromic substring.
- If all substrings of the input string are palindromes, it will return 0.

Overall, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and will work correctly for all valid inputs.
