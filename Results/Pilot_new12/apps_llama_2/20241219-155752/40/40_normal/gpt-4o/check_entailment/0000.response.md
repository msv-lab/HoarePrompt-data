Correctness: **False**.

The given Python program does not work as expected in all cases. It checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome, and if it is not, it checks if the substrings `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` are palindromes. However, this approach is not sufficient to find the longest non-palindromic substring.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string is "abcdefabc". In this case, the program checks if the string is a palindrome, which it is not, so it returns the length of the string (`9`). However, it does not check all substrings of the string to ensure that it has found the longest non-palindromic substring.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate all substrings of the input string and check each one to see if it is a palindrome. If it finds any non-palindromic substring, it should keep track of the longest one found so far.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

s = input().strip()
max_length = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not is_palindrome(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```
This corrected version of the program checks all substrings of the input string and keeps track of the longest non-palindromic substring found.
