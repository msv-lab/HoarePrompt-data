Correctness: **False**

The code checks if the input string is a palindrome, and if not, checks if the string without the first or last character is a palindrome. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0, assuming that all substrings of the string are palindromes. However, this approach does not ensure that all substrings of the string are checked.

A counterexample is the string "abba". In this case, the string itself is a palindrome, but the substring "ab" is not. However, the code will return 0, because it only checks the string itself and the string without the first or last character, which are also palindromes ("bba" and "abb" respectively).

To correctly solve the problem, the code should check all possible substrings of the input string, not just the string itself and the string without the first or last character. 

The code should be modified to generate all possible substrings of the input string, check each one if it's a palindrome, and return the maximum length of the substrings that are not palindromes. If all substrings are palindromes, it should return 0. 

Here is a simple idea of how the code can be modified:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

s = input().strip()
max_length = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not func_1(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```

This code generates all possible substrings of the input string, checks each one if it's a palindrome, and updates the `max_length` variable if it finds a longer substring that is not a palindrome. Finally, it prints the `max_length` variable, which stores the maximum length of the substrings that are not palindromes. If all substrings are palindromes, it prints 0.
