You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It iterates over all possible pairs of lengths `(a, b)` that could form a rectangle with the parts of the stick, with the constraints that `a` and `b` must be in the range `[1, n//2]` and `a <= b`. It also checks that the sum of `2*(a + b)` equals `n`, which means that the rectangle can be formed using the parts of the stick. Additionally, it ensures that `a!= b`, which is necessary because it's impossible to form a square.

The reason why the program only iterates up to `(n - a) // 2` for `b` is because if `b` is greater than `(n - a) // 2`, then the remaining two parts would have the same length as `a` and `b` respectively, and the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` would not be met.

The program also correctly counts the number of distinct ways to divide the stick, by incrementing the `ways` counter for each valid pair `(a, b)`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is `n // 2` if `n` is greater than 1, `b` is `(n - a) // 2` if `n` is greater than 1, and `ways` is the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` that satisfy `a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `ways` is 0
    return ways
    #The program returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers (a, b) that satisfy a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n, which is the value of 'ways'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2` times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`. The function handles the case when `n` is `1` by returning `0`, as there are no distinct pairs of positive integers that satisfy the given condition. For `n > 1`, the function correctly counts the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that meet the specified criteria. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the count of distinct pairs, without modifying any external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
