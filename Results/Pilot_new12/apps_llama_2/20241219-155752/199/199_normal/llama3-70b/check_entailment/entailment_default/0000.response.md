Correctness: **True**.

The given code correctly implements the function to count the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts of positive integer lengths such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The code iterates over all possible pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. This corresponds to the condition that the four parts of the stick are `a`, `a`, `b`, and `b`, which can form a rectangle but not a square.

The function correctly handles the case when `n` is a positive integer, and it returns the correct count of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that meet the specified criteria. The function assumes that `n` will always be a positive integer, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code. For example, when `n` is `6`, the code returns `1`, which corresponds to the only possible way to divide the stick into four parts: `{1, 1, 2, 2}`. Similarly, when `n` is `20`, the code returns `4`, which corresponds to the four possible ways to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

Overall, the code correctly implements the function to count the number of ways to split a stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
