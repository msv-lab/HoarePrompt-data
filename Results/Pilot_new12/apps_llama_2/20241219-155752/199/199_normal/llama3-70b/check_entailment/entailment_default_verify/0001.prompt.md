You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct. It iterates over all possible pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` such that `a <= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, which represents the total length of the stick. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the four parts can form a rectangle, and the condition `a!= b` ensures that it is not a square. 

The program correctly counts the number of such pairs, which corresponds to the number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The program handles all possible cases and does not have any obvious edge cases that are not handled. The examples given in the problem description also match the output of the program, which further supports the correctness of the program. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n), which is reasonable for the given constraints. 

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2` times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`. The function handles the case when `n` is `1` by returning `0`, as there are no distinct pairs of positive integers that satisfy the given condition. For `n > 1`, the function correctly counts the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that meet the specified criteria. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the count of distinct pairs, without modifying any external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
