Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it's correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= b` and `a!= b`. This is done using two nested `for` loops that iterate over `a` and `b`.
2. For each pair `(a, b)`, the program checks if the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` is satisfied. This condition ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts is equal to `n`.
3. If the condition is satisfied, the program increments the `ways` variable by 1. This variable keeps track of the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition.
4. Finally, the program returns the value of `ways`, which represents the total number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square.

The program is correct because it:

* Iterates over all possible pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` that satisfy `1 <= a <= b` and `a!= b`, which ensures that all possible ways of splitting the stick are considered.
* Checks the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`, which ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts is equal to `n`.
* Increments the `ways` variable only when the condition is satisfied, which ensures that the correct number of ways is counted.

The program does not need to explicitly check for the condition "it's impossible to form a square" because the condition `a!= b` already ensures that the four parts are not all equal, which means that a square cannot be formed.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the logic specified in the problem description and counts the correct number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square.
