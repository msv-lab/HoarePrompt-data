Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a solution to the problem of counting the number of ways to split a stick into four parts of positive integer length such that a rectangle can be formed using these parts, but a square cannot. 

The function `func_1(n)` iterates over all possible pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is less than or equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, it increments the count of ways.

This code correctly handles all potential cases, as it checks all possible pairs of integers that satisfy the given condition. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts is equal to `n`, and the condition `a!= b` ensures that the parts cannot be used to form a square.

The code also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description. For example, when `n` is `6`, the function returns `1`, which corresponds to the only possible way to divide the stick into four parts of positive integer length, namely `{1, 1, 2, 2}`. Similarly, when `n` is `20`, the function returns `4`, which corresponds to the four possible ways to divide the stick into four parts of positive integer length, namely `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

Since the code correctly handles all potential cases and the provided examples, it is considered correct.
