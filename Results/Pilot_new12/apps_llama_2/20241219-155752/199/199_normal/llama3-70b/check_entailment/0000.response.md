Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It iterates over all possible pairs of lengths `(a, b)` that could form a rectangle with the parts of the stick, with the constraints that `a` and `b` must be in the range `[1, n//2]` and `a <= b`. It also checks that the sum of `2*(a + b)` equals `n`, which means that the rectangle can be formed using the parts of the stick. Additionally, it ensures that `a!= b`, which is necessary because it's impossible to form a square.

The reason why the program only iterates up to `(n - a) // 2` for `b` is because if `b` is greater than `(n - a) // 2`, then the remaining two parts would have the same length as `a` and `b` respectively, and the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` would not be met.

The program also correctly counts the number of distinct ways to divide the stick, by incrementing the `ways` counter for each valid pair `(a, b)`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs.
