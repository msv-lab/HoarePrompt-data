Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts of positive integer lengths, such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square.

Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires that the four parts can be used to form a rectangle, but not a square. This means that the parts must be able to be paired into two pairs of equal lengths, and these two lengths must be different.
2. The program iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` such that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `2 * (a + b) == n`. This ensures that `a` and `b` can be used to form two pairs of equal lengths that add up to `n`.
3. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the four parts can be used to form a rectangle. If `a` and `b` satisfy this condition, then the four parts can be arranged as `a`, `a`, `b`, `b`, which forms a rectangle.
4. The condition `a!= b` ensures that it's impossible to form a square using the four parts. If `a` and `b` were equal, then the four parts would all have the same length, which would allow them to be arranged into a square.

Overall, the program correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts that can be used to form a rectangle, but not a square, and therefore meets the requirements of the problem statement.
