#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is `n // 2` if `n` is greater than 1, `b` is `(n - a) // 2` if `n` is greater than 1, and `ways` is the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` that satisfy `a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `ways` is 0
    return ways
    #The program returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers (a, b) that satisfy a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n, which is the value of 'ways'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2` times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`. The function handles the case when `n` is `1` by returning `0`, as there are no distinct pairs of positive integers that satisfy the given condition. For `n > 1`, the function correctly counts the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that meet the specified criteria. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the count of distinct pairs, without modifying any external state.
