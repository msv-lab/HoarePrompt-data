The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2` times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`. The function handles the case when `n` is `1` by returning `0`, as there are no distinct pairs of positive integers that satisfy the given condition. For `n > 1`, the function correctly counts the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that meet the specified criteria. The function does not perform any error checking on the input `n`, so it assumes that `n` will always be a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the count of distinct pairs, without modifying any external state.
