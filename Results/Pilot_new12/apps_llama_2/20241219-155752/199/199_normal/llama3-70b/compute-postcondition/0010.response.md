To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 5.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is 3.
   - The condition for `ways` is: if `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then `ways` is 1, otherwise `ways` is 0.

2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - `a` is not equal to `b` because `a` is 1 and `b` is 3.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is 1 + 3 = 4.
   - Two times the sum of `a` and `b` is 2 * 4 = 8.
   - For `ways` to be 1, `n` must equal 8, given the condition 2 * (a + b) = n. 
   - If `n` is not 8, `ways` remains 0.

3. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1, regardless of the initial value of `ways`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer greater than 5.
   - `a` remains 1.
   - `b` remains 3.
   - If initially `n` equals 8 (thus satisfying the condition for `ways` to be 1), then `ways` was 1 and becomes 2 after the increment.
   - If initially `n` does not equal 8, then `ways` was 0 and becomes 1 after the increment.

Given these considerations, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 5, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, if `n` equals 8, then `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is 1**
