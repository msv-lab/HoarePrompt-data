The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers (a, b) that satisfy a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the total number of distinct pairs of positive integers (a, b) where a is not equal to b and 2 times the sum of a and b equals n.**
