The given code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. It also states that `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`. 

Given that `a` is 3 and `b` is 3, and knowing that `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, we can substitute `a` and `b` into the equation to get `2 * (3 + 3) = n`, which simplifies to `2 * 6 = n` and further to `12 = n`. This satisfies the condition that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7. However, the statement that the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b` is contradictory since both `a` and `b` are given as 3, making them equal. For the purpose of this analysis, we will consider the conditions as given but note this inconsistency.

The increment of `ways` by 1 indicates that we have found an additional distinct solution that satisfies the given equation within the specified range for `b`. 

The value of `n` remains 12, as derived from the initial values of `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain 3, despite the initial condition stating they are not equal, which appears to be an error in the problem statement. The range for `b` is from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, which for `n = 12` gives a range from 2 to 5.

Thus, after executing the code, `ways` has been incremented by 1, indicating one more distinct solution has been found. The states of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, with `n` being 12, and `a` and `b` being 3. 

Output State: **`n` is 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to 5, plus one additional solution**
