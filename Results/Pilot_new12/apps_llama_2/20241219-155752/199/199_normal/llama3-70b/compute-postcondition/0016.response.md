The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, the current values of `a` and `b` are not equal is a false statement since `a` equals `b`, and the current value of `n` is equal to 2 times the sum of the current values of `a` and `b`. This implies that `n` = 2 * (`a` + `b`) = 2 * (2 + 2) = 8. 

The states of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code. The variable `ways` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the given equation plus 1**
