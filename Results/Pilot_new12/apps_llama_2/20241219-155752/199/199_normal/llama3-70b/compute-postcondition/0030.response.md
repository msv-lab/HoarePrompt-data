To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the loop condition and the current state after the previous iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
And the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7.
- `a` is 3.
- `b` is 3.
- If `n` equals 12, `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to 5, plus one additional solution; otherwise, `ways` remains the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.

At the start of the next iteration, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over a range of values. Therefore, if `b` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. 

Given that `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. If `b` is 4, we need to ensure that `n` is such that `(n - a) // 2 + 1` is at least 4, considering `a` is 3. This implies `(n - 3) // 2 + 1 >= 4`, which simplifies to `(n - 3) >= 6`, and thus `n >= 9`. 

Since the state of `ways` depends on `n` and the range of `b`, its calculation remains tied to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` but now with `b` being 4. If `n` equals 12, the special condition for `ways` still applies, adjusting the range of `b` from 2 to 5. Otherwise, `ways` is calculated based on the standard range up to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 9 to ensure the loop condition can be met with `b` incremented.
- `a` remains 3.
- `b` is incremented to 4.
- The calculation of `ways` adjusts based on the new value of `b` and the conditions related to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, and if `n` equals 12, `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to 5, plus one additional solution; otherwise, `ways` remains the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.**
