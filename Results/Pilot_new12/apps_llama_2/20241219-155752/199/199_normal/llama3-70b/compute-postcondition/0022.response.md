The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `ways` is not specified in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `a` is still 2, and `b` is still 4. 

Since `ways` was not defined in the initial state, we can only conclude that its value has been increased by 1 from its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, `ways` is the initial value of `ways` plus 1**
