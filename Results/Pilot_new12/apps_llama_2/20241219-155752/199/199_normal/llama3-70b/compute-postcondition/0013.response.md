According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and `n`. If `a` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be increased by 1, so `a` is 2. 
The variable `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (1 + b) == n` where `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`. This means `b == (n - 2) / 2` and `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`. Since `a` is now 2, we are looking for solutions where `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2` for the equation `2 * (2 + b) == n` or `2 * (1 + (1 + b)) == n` which means we are looking for `b` such that `b + 1 == (n - 2) / 2` or `b == (n - 4) / 2` and `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2` and `b + 1!= 1` and `b + 1` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.
However, we must express `ways` in terms of `a`. We do that by understanding that we need to find the number of `b` values that can solve the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, `b!= a - 1` and `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 2, `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2` and `b!= a - 1` and `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`**
