Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is 2, `b` is 3. If `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 * (a + b) equals `n`, then if `n` is 8, `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the given equation plus 2, otherwise `ways` is the previous value of `ways` plus 1. If the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `n` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` being 2, `b` being 3, and if `n` is 8, then `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the given equation plus 1, otherwise `ways` remains unchanged.***
