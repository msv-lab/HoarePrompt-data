The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 0, so after the increment, `ways` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ways` is 1, `a` and `b` are such that `a` is not equal to `b`, and the sum of `a` and `b` multiplied by 2 equals `n`**
