To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop's execution depends on the value of `a` and the expression `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, which means `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2` or `n` must be at least `2*a + 1`. Given `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `a` is 3, we can infer that `n` must be at least 7 for the loop to potentially execute.

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is 3.
- `b` is initially `(n - a) // 2`, but this value is about to be overridden by the loop.
- `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Considering the loop, `b` will take values from `a` (which is 3) to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` (which is 3) must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Given `a` is 3, this implies that `n` must be such that `(n - 3) // 2 + 1` is at least 3, simplifying to `n >= 7`.

At the start of the loop, `b` would be 3 (the initial value of `a`), and as the loop progresses, `b` will increment up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 7 to ensure the loop can start and execute with `a` being 3.
- `a` is 3.
- `b` starts at 3.
- `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, but its value is not directly affected by the loop's initialization.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`**
