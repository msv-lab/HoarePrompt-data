To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the values of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, because the loop iterates over the range of values from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. 

So, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be 2.

The value of `a` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop statement. 

The condition `if a is not equal to b and the sum of a and b multiplied by 2 equals n` becomes relevant only when the loop body is executed, not at the start of the loop iteration. So, the value of `ways` is not directly affected by the loop iteration itself but by the body of the loop, which is not considered here.

Therefore, considering only the loop statement, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `ways` is 0**
