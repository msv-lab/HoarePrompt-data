Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, and if `n` equals 12, `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to 5, plus one additional solution; otherwise, `ways` remains the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.***
