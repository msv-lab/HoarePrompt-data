According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2 (to satisfy `n // 2 + 1 > 1`), the loop can execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it needs to be refined to ensure it's at least 2 for the loop to execute. The variable `a` will take values from 1 to `n // 2` (inclusive) during the loop iterations. Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `a` should be initialized to 1 (the first value in the range). The variable `ways` is 0, which does not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
