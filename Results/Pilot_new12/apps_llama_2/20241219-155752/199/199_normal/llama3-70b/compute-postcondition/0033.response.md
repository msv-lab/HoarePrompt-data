To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the conditions provided.

Given:
- The loop statement is `for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):`
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `a` is 3, and `b` is 4.

Since `b` is within the range defined by `a` and `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `b` needs to increment by 1. 

Thus, the new value of `b` should be 5.

The conditions regarding `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ways` are dependent on the outcome of the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` and whether `a` equals `b`. However, since we are only tasked with determining the state at the start of the next iteration based on the provided loop statement, we focus on the increment of `b`.

Considering `b` needs to be incremented to execute the loop again, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `a` is 3, `b` is 5**
