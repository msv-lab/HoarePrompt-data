Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 7, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b`, and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`**
