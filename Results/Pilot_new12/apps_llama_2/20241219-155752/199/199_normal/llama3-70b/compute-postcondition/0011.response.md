Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 5, `a` is 1, `b` is 3. If `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then if `n` equals 8, `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is 1. If `a` equals `b` or 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` does not equal `n`, then `ways` remains unchanged as 0.**
