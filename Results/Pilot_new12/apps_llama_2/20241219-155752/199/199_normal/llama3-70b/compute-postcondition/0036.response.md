To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    if a!= b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
        ways += 1
```
The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1,
- `a` is 3,
- `b` is `(n - a) // 2`,
- `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.

From the loop code, we can see that `b` will take on values from `a` (which is 3) to `(n - a) // 2`. For each value of `b`, if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` is incremented by 1.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `b` will have taken on all values in the specified range, and `ways` will have been incremented for each distinct solution where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`.

Given the initial value of `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, and considering the loop only increments `ways` for solutions where `b` ranges from `a` (3) to `(n - a) // 2` and `a!= b`, we need to understand how the final value of `ways` relates to the initial conditions and the loop's operation.

Since the loop specifically looks for solutions where `a!= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, and only increments `ways` under these conditions, we must consider what happens to `ways` when these conditions are met.

The final value of `b` after the loop will be `(n - a) // 2`, as that's the last value in the range specified by the loop.

To understand the final state of `ways`, we must consider the initial definition of `ways` and how the loop modifies it. The loop increments `ways` for each `b` in the specified range where `a!= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`. This means that the final value of `ways` will include all distinct solutions from the initial range (2 to `(n - 1) // 2`) plus any additional solutions found within the loop's range (from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`) where `a!= b`.

However, since the loop's condition for incrementing `ways` is more restrictive (requiring `a!= b`), the final value of `ways` will be the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, with the understanding that solutions where `a == b` are not included in the increments made by the loop.

Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 3, `b` is `(n - a) // 2`, and `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, with the consideration that the loop's operation may have incremented `ways` for solutions within the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` where `a!= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.**
