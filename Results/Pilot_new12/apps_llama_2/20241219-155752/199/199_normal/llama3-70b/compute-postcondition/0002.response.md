According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `n`, and the range `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. If `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute at least once. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `a` is 1, we need to ensure that `(n - a) // 2 + 1` is greater than `a`. Since `a` is 1, we need `(n - 1) // 2 + 1` to be greater than 1. This condition is met if `n` is greater than 3, but since we only know `n` is greater than 1, we must consider the condition for the loop to start executing: `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. 

For the loop to execute, `b` will start from `a`, which is 1. So, at the start of the loop, `b` is 1, `a` is 1, `ways` is 0, and `n` must be at least 3 or more for the loop to potentially execute more than once, but given `n` is greater than 1, the minimum requirement for the loop to start is met.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1**
