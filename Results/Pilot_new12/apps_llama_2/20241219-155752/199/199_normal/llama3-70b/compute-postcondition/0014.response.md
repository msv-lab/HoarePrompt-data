To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is 2.
- `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2` and `b!= a - 1` and `b` is in the range from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, we need to consider the following:

1. The range of `b` is from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Since `a` is 2, the range of `b` starts at 2.
2. For the loop to have at least one iteration, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be greater than `a`, because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. Therefore, `n` must be such that `(n - a) // 2 + 1 > a`.
3. Given that `a` is 2, we substitute it into the equation to get `(n - 2) // 2 + 1 > 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 2) // 2 > 1`. Therefore, `n - 2 > 2`, which gives us `n > 4`.
4. The condition `b!= a - 1` translates to `b!= 1` since `a` is 2. This condition is naturally satisfied because the range of `b` starts at 2.

Considering these points, the state before the loop starts needs to reflect that `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute, and `b` starts at 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `ways` is the number of distinct positive integer solutions to the given equation, `b` is 2**
