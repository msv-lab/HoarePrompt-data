According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `b` is less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is 2, `b` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1. So, `b` becomes 4. The range of `b` is from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`, so for the loop to execute again, `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must be greater than 4. Since `a` is 2, `(n - 2) // 2 + 1` must be greater than 4. Therefore, `(n - 2) // 2` must be greater than or equal to 4, which means `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to 8, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `a` is 2, `b` is 4**
