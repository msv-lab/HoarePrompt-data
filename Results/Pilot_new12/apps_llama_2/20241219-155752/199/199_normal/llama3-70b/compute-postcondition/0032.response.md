Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `a` is 3, `b` is 4. If `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then if `n` equals 12, `ways` is 3; otherwise, `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2`, plus one. If `a` equals `b` or `2 * (a + b)` does not equal `n`, then the state of `ways` remains unchanged as the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is not 12, or `ways` is the total number of distinct positive integer solutions to the equation `2 * (a + b) == n` where `b` ranges from 2 to 5, plus one if `n` equals 12.***
