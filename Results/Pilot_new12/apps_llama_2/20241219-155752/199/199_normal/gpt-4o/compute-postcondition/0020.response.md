The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 12, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, if `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is even, then `count` is 1 if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, otherwise `count` remains 0.

Now, let's think step by step: 
The value of `rem` is updated to `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given `a` is 3 and `b` is 3, `rem` becomes `n - 2 * (3 + 3)`, which simplifies to `n - 2 * 6` or `n - 12`.

Since `n` is larger than or equal to 12, `n - 12` will be greater than or equal to 0. 

Also, `n - 12` is even if `n` is even and odd if `n` is odd.

The states of the other variables are not affected by the update of `rem`. 

Now we need to consider the condition for `count`. If `rem` (now `n - 12`) is greater than 0 and even, then we check if `a` (which is 3) is not equal to `rem // 2` (now `(n - 12) // 2`). If `a` is not equal to `(n - 12) // 2`, then `count` is 1; otherwise, `count` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 12, `rem` is `n - 12`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, if `n - 12` is greater than 0 and `n - 12` is even, then `count` is 1 if `a` is not equal to `(n - 12) // 2`, otherwise `count` remains 0**
