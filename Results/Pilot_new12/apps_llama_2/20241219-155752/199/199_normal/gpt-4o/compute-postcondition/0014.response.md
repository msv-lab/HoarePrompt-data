To find the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 8
- `rem` is `n - 4`
- `count` is 0
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 2

The code snippet is:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
```

Now, let's calculate the new value of `rem` based on the initial state values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given that `a` is 2 and `b` is 2, `a + b` equals 4. Thus, `2 * (a + b)` equals `2 * 4`, which is 8.

So, the new value of `rem` is `n - 8`.

Since `n` is larger than or equal to 8, `n - 8` will be larger than or equal to 0.

The states of `n`, `count`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 8
- `rem` is `n - 8`
- `count` is 0
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 2

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 8`, `count` is 0, `a` is 2, `b` is 2**
