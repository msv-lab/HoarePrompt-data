Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `rem` is `n - 4`. If `rem` is greater than 0 and an even number, and `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`, then `count` is 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1. If `rem` is less than or equal to 0 or an odd number, then the values of `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, with `count` being 0, and `a` and `b` being 1.***
