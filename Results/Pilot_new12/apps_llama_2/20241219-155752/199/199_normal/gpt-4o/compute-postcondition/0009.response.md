The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` was 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`, and the current value of `rem` is greater than 0 and an even number. The current value of `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`.**
