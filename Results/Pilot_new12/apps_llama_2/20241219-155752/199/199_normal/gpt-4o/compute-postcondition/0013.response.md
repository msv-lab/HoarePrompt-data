The value of `b` is updated to be equal to `a`. The previous value of `a` is 2, so `b` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 4`, `count` is 0, `a` is 2, and `b` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 4`, `count` is 0, `a` is 2, and `b` is 2**
