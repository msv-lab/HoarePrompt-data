The code `b = a` assigns the value of `a` to `b`. Given the initial state, `a` is 1. 

So, `b` becomes 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1**
