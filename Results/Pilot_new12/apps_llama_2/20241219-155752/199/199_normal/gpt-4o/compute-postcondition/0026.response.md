The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, there are two possible return values based on the conditions provided: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: The function returns the count of iterations where `n - 2 * (a + n // 4)` is greater than 0, even, and not equal to `2 * a`, for `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 4`, with `n` being a positive integer larger than or equal to 6, and `b` equal to `n // 4`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 0 or the count of iterations satisfying specific conditions related to `n` and its divisions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer parameter n, returns either 0 or the count of iterations where a specific condition related to n is met.**
