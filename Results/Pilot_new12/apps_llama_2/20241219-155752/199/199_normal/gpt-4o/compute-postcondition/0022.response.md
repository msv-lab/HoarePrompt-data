Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 12, `rem` is `n - 12`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3. If `n - 12` is greater than 0 and `n - 12` is even, then if `a` equals `(n - 12) // 2`, `count` is 1, otherwise if `a` is not equal to `(n - 12) // 2`, `count` is 2. If `n - 12` is not greater than 0 or `n - 12` is not even, `count` remains 0 or unchanged.***
