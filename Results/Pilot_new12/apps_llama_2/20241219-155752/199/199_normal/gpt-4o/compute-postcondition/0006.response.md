The value of `rem` is assigned the result of the expression `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1, we can substitute these values into the expression. 

So, `rem = n - 2 * (1 + 1)` which simplifies to `rem = n - 2 * 2` and further to `rem = n - 4`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`**
