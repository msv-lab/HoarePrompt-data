The code changes the value of `b` to be equal to `a`. The value of `a` is 3, so `b` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still a positive integer and larger than or equal to 12, 
`rem` is still `n - 8`, 
`a` is still 3, 
`b` is now 3, 
and if `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is even, then `count` is 1 if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, otherwise `count` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and larger than or equal to 12, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, if `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is even, then `count` is 1 if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, otherwise `count` remains 0**
