Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description requires that the stick be split into four parts such that it is possible to form a rectangle using these parts but impossible to form a square. However, the code only checks if `a == b` and `rem` is even and not equal to `2 * a`, which is not a sufficient condition to satisfy the problem requirements.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when `n` is equal to `8`. In this case, the code returns `1`, but the correct answer should be `0` because the only way to split the stick is into four parts of length `2`, which can form a square.

Another issue with the code is that it does not consider cases where `a!= b`. The problem statement does not require `a` and `b` to be equal, but the code only checks for cases where `a == b`.

To fix the code, it should iterate over all possible combinations of `a` and `b` such that `a + b + c + d == n` and `a <= b <= c <= d`, and check if it is possible to form a rectangle using these parts but impossible to form a square. The current code does not satisfy these requirements. 

For example, when `n = 20`, the code returns `4` but it should return all possible combinations where `a + b + c + d == 20` and it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square, such as `{1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7}, {4, 4, 6, 6}`. 

The given code only checks for cases where `a == b` and `c == d`, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.
