Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description. Here's why:

1.  The program takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the number of ways to split the stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to form a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but impossible to form a square.
2.  The function `func_1(n)` first checks if `n` is less than 6. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because a stick of length less than 6 cannot be split into four parts of positive integer length.
3.  For `n` greater than or equal to 6, the function iterates over a range from 1 to `n // 4` (inclusive), and for each iteration `a`, it calculates `rem = n - 2 * (a + a)` (since `b` is set to `a` in the code). This corresponds to splitting the stick into two pairs of equal parts of length `a` and `rem // 2`.
4.  The function checks if `rem` is greater than 0, even, and not equal to `2 * a`. This ensures that the stick can be split into four parts of positive integer length, and that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square.
5.  The function increments a counter `count` for each iteration where these conditions are met. Finally, it returns the `count` of iterations satisfying these conditions.
6.  The function only considers the case where two pairs of equal parts are of different lengths. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer `x` such that the number of parts of length `x` in the first way differs from the number of parts of length `x` in the second way.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and returns the expected result for all valid inputs.
