Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it only considers the case where two parts have length `a` and two parts have length `b = a`. However, the problem description allows for the possibility that two parts have length `a` and two parts have length `b`, where `a` is not necessarily equal to `b`.

The program should consider all possible combinations of `a` and `b` such that `n = 2a + 2b` and `a!= b`, because this is the condition for forming a rectangle but not a square with the four parts. 

The program should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy this condition, rather than just setting `b = a`.

To fix this, the program should be modified to consider all possible combinations of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition `n = 2a + 2b` and `a!= b`. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            if 2 * a + 2 * b == n:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

This version of the program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square. It iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the condition `n = 2a + 2b` and `a < b`. 

However, please note that this program can be optimized further for better performance. The above program has a time complexity of O(n^2) whereas this problem can be solved in O(n) time complexity. 

Here's an optimized version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = (n - 2 * a) // 2
        if b > a and (n - 2 * a) % 2 == 0 and b > 0:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

This version of the program has a time complexity of O(n) and correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square.
