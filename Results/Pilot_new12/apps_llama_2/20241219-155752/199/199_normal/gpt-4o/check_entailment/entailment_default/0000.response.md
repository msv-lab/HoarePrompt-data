Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect because it only considers the case where two pairs of equal length parts can be formed, but it does not consider the case where two different pairs of equal length parts can be formed.

For example, if the input is 12, the code will only consider the cases where two pairs of equal length parts can be formed, such as {2, 2, 4, 4} and {3, 3, 3, 3}. However, it will not consider the case where two different pairs of equal length parts can be formed, such as {1, 1, 5, 5}.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to consider all possible combinations of four parts that can be formed from the input length. 

Another issue with the code is that it does not correctly calculate the number of ways to split the stick into four parts. The code only considers the case where two pairs of equal length parts can be formed, but it does not consider the case where the two pairs of equal length parts are swapped.

For example, if the input is 12, the code will count the case {2, 2, 4, 4} as one way, but it will not count the case {4, 4, 2, 2} as a different way, even though these two cases are distinct.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to correctly calculate the number of ways to split the stick into four parts, considering all possible combinations and permutations of the parts. 

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to fix these issues:

```python
n = int(input())

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            c = b
            rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
            if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0 and rem // 2!= a and rem // 2!= b:
                count += 1
    return count

print(func_1(n))
```

This modified code considers all possible combinations of four parts and correctly calculates the number of ways to split the stick into four parts. However, this code is still not optimal and can be further optimized to reduce its time complexity. 

In conclusion, the original code is incorrect because it does not consider all possible combinations of four parts and does not correctly calculate the number of ways to split the stick into four parts. The modified code fixes these issues and provides a more accurate solution to the problem.
