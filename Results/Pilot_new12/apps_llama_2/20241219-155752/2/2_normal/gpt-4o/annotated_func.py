#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of `n`, an integer between 1 and 162 inclusive, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and returns the sum of its digits, resulting in an integer between 1 and 162 inclusive. The function does not modify the input `n` and only performs a calculation based on its value. Upon execution, the function will always return a positive integer, as the sum of digits of any positive integer is at least 1. The function's return value is determined solely by the input `n` and does not depend on any external state. The code handles all potential edge cases, including single-digit numbers and numbers with leading zeros when converted to a string, correctly calculating the sum of their digits.
