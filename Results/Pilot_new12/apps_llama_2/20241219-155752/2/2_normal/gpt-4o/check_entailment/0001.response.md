Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the candidate is generated when the first digit of `x` is '1'. In this case, the candidate is set to `'9' * (n - 1)`, which is incorrect because this number is not necessarily less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, the program does not handle the case when `x` itself has the maximum sum of digits among all numbers not exceeding `x`.

For example, if the input is `19`, the program will incorrectly output `9`, whereas the correct output should be `19` because `19` has a sum of digits `1+9 = 10`, which is greater than the sum of digits of `9`, which is `9`.

To fix this issue, the program should generate the candidate by comparing the sum of digits of `x` with the sum of digits of the number formed by changing the first digit of `x` to the largest possible digit that does not exceed the first digit of `x`, and then filling the rest of the digits with '9's. If the sum of digits of the candidate is greater than the sum of digits of `x`, then the candidate should be output; otherwise, `x` should be output. 

Another issue with the code is the function `func_1` is used before it's defined. In Python, you have to define a function before you can use it. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

x = int(input().strip())
x_str = str(x)
n = len(x_str)
if x_str[0]!= '1':
    candidate = int(x_str[0]) - 1
    candidate = str(candidate) + '9' * (n - 1)
else:
    candidate = str(x_str[0]) + '9' * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if x_str[i]!= '9':
            break
    else:
        candidate = str(int(x_str[0]) - 1) + '9' * (n - 1)
candidate = int(candidate)
sum_x = sum_of_digits(x)
sum_candidate = sum_of_digits(candidate)
if sum_candidate > sum_x:
    print(candidate)
else:
    print(x)
```
