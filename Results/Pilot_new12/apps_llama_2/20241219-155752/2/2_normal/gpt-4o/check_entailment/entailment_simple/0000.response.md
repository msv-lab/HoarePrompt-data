Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes an integer `x` as input and converts it to a string `x_str` to easily access its digits.
2. It checks if the first digit of `x_str` is not '1'. If it's not '1', it generates a candidate number by decrementing the first digit by 1 and filling the rest of the digits with '9's. This is a valid approach because the problem statement asks for the largest number that doesn't exceed `x` and has the maximum sum of digits.
3. If the first digit of `x_str` is '1', it generates a candidate number by filling all digits with '9's, except the first one, which is removed. This ensures that the candidate number is still less than or equal to `x`.
4. The program then calculates the sum of digits of both `x` and the candidate number using the `func_1` function.
5. Finally, it compares the sums of digits and prints the number with the maximum sum of digits. If the sum of digits of the candidate number is greater than the sum of digits of `x`, it prints the candidate number; otherwise, it prints `x`.

This approach guarantees that the program will always find the largest number that doesn't exceed `x` and has the maximum sum of digits, which is in line with the problem description.

The use of `func_1` to calculate the sum of digits is also correct, as it simply converts the number to a string, iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, and sums them up.

In summary, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem description, and it does so for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
