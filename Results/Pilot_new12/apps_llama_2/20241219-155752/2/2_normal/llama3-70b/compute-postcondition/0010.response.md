The code calculates the sum of the digits of `i` (which is 2) and assigns it to `digit_sum`. The sum of the digits of 2 is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 2.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 2**
