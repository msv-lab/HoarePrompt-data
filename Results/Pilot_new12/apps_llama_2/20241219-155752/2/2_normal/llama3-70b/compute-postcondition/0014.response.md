According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is greater than 2 (since `x` is greater than 1 and `i` has already reached 2). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The loop will execute again if `x` is greater than or equal to 3 (or simply, `x` must be at least 3, but since `x` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 2 for `i` to reach 3).
State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `digit_sum` is 2, if `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is 2 and `max_num` is 2**
