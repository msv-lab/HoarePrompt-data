According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1` (or equivalently, `i` is less than or equal to `x`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is greater than 1 (since `x` is greater than 0 and `i` has already been incremented from its initial value of 0 or has started from 1). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Also, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is greater than 0**
