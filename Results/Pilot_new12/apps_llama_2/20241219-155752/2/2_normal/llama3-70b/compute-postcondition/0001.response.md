The code initializes a variable `max_sum` to 0. The initial state mentions that `x` is an input integer. 

`max_sum` is assigned the value 0. The state of `x` is not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `max_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `max_sum` is 0**
