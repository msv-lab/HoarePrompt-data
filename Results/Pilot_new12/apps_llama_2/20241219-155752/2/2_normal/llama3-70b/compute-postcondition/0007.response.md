The code updates the value of `max_num` to be equal to `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `x` is still an input integer greater than 0, `max_sum` equals the current value of `digit_sum`, `digit_sum` is greater than its initial value of 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 0, `max_sum` equals the current value of `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 1, and `digit_sum` is greater than 1**
