Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3. If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is 3 and `max_num` is 3. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` retain their previous values, where `max_sum` is 2 and `max_num` is 2 if the previous `digit_sum` (2) is greater than the original `max_sum`.***
