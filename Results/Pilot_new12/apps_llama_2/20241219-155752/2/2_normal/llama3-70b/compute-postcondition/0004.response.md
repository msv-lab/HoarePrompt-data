The code calculates the sum of the digits of the number `i` and assigns it to `digit_sum`. Since `i` is 1, the sum of its digits is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
