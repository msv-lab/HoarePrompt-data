The value of `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The previous value of `digit_sum` is 3. Therefore, the new value of `max_sum` is 3.

Since the previous `digit_sum` (which is now the current `digit_sum`) is 3, and it is greater than the previous `max_sum` (which was 2), `max_num` should still be updated to the current number, but we don't have information about the current number, we only have `x` which is an input integer greater than 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, and `max_num` is still equal to the number that had `digit_sum` equal to `max_sum` (in this case `max_num` should be the number that had `digit_sum` equal to 3).

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is the number that had `digit_sum` equal to 3**
