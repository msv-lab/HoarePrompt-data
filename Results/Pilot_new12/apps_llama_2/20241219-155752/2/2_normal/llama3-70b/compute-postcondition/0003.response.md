According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an input integer, `max_sum` is 0, and `max_num` is 0. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 1. 

State: **`x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1**
