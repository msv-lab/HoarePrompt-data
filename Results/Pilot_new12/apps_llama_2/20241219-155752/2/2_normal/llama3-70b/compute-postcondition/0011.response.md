The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. The initial state has `x` as an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 2. 

Since `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`, `max_sum` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2**
