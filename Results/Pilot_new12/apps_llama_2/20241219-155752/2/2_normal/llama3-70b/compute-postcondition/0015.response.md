To calculate the new value of `digit_sum`, we need to sum the digits of `i`, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 3 is 3.

The initial state is: `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 2, and if `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is 2 and `max_num` is 2.

After executing the code, `digit_sum` is updated to 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, and if the previous `digit_sum` (2) is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is 2 and `max_num` is 2**
