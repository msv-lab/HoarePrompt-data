The print statement is executed, and the value of `max_num` is printed. The values of the variables do not change, but the value of `max_num` is returned as output.
Output State: **`x` is the original input integer, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of digits of any number from 1 to `x`, `max_num` is the number from 1 to `x` whose digits sum up to `max_sum`, and `max_num` has been printed and returned as output. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `max_sum` is 0 and `max_num` is 0.**
