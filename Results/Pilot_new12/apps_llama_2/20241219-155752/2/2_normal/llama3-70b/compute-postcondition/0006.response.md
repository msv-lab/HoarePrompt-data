The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `digit_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, and initially `digit_sum` is 1 but the current value of `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then after the update, `max_sum` equals the current value of `digit_sum`, which is greater than its initial value. `max_num` remains 0 as it was not updated. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than 0, `max_sum` equals the current value of `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, and `digit_sum` is greater than its initial value of 1**
