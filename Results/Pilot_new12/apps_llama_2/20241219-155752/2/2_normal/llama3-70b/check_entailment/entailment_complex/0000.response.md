Correctness: **False**

The program does not always meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The reason for this is that the problem description asks to determine the biggest integer whose sum of digits is maximum if there are multiple integers with the same maximum sum. However, the given program may not always find the biggest integer in such cases.

The issue is with the line `if digit_sum > max_sum:` inside the for loop. This line updates `max_sum` and `max_num` whenever it finds a number with a greater sum of digits. However, if it finds a number with the same sum of digits as `max_sum`, it will not update `max_num`, even if the new number is larger than the current `max_num`.

For example, if the input is 99, the program will correctly output 99 because 99 is the largest number whose sum of digits is 18. However, if the input is a number like 999, the program will still output 999, but if there is another number like 989 with the same sum of digits (9+8+9 = 26) but larger than 979 (which has the same sum of digits as 989), the program will output 989 instead of 999.

To fix this, the condition should be `if digit_sum > max_sum or (digit_sum == max_sum and i > max_num):` to ensure that if there are multiple numbers with the same maximum sum, the largest one is always chosen.

Here is the corrected code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18 inclusive.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        
        if digit_sum > max_sum or (digit_sum == max_sum and i > max_num):
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is the original input integer, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of digits of any number from 1 to `x`, and `max_num` is the number from 1 to `x` whose digits sum up to `max_sum`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `max_sum` is 0 and `max_num` is 0.
    print(max_num)
```
