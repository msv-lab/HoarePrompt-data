The function determines whether a path exists from the character 'G' to the character 'T' in the input string, moving in steps of `k`, without encountering a '#'. It takes an integer `n` between 2 and 100 (inclusive), an integer `k` between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once. The function returns 'YES' if such a path exists and 'NO' otherwise, after checking all possible positions in the range from the index of 'G' to the index of 'T' with a step of `k`. The function handles cases where the initial position of 'G' is greater than the position of 'T' by swapping their indices, ensuring that 'G' is always to the left of 'T' before the path search. The function correctly handles edge cases, including when 'G' and 'T' are at adjacent positions or when there are '#' characters blocking the path.
