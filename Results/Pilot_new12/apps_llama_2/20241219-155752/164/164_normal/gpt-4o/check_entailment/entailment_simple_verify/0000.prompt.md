You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        (G_pos, T_pos) = (T_pos, G_pos)
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks if there's a direct path of jumps from the grasshopper to the target, without considering all possible jumps. The program only checks positions that are at a distance of `k` from the current position within the range from the grasshopper's position to the target's position, moving forward. It does not account for the possibility of jumping backwards or exploring all reachable positions through a series of jumps.

A case where this program does not work as expected is when the grasshopper and the target are not in a direct line of `k`-step jumps but can be reached through a different sequence of jumps. For example, consider a scenario where the line has obstacles in such a way that the grasshopper needs to jump over them in a non-linear sequence to reach the target. The given program does not handle such scenarios because it only checks a linear progression of `k`-step jumps from the grasshopper towards the target, without considering the actual reachability through jumps over obstacles or through jumping backwards and then forwards.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a more comprehensive approach, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all reachable positions from the grasshopper, considering both forward and backward jumps of `k` steps, until it finds the target or exhausts all possibilities.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n - 1 (inclusive), the input string has a length of n and consists only of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', and the characters 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once. If initially `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the initial value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` is updated to the initial value of `G_pos`, resulting in `G_pos` being less than `T_pos`. If initially `G_pos` is not greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged, with `G_pos` being less than or equal to `T_pos`.
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `True` if there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', and `False` otherwise.
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
