You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        (G_pos, T_pos) = (T_pos, G_pos)
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not cover all possible cases as described in the problem description. One major issue with the program is that it only checks if the grasshopper can jump to the target insect position in the direction from the grasshopper to the target, with a jump size of `k`. However, it does not consider jumps from the grasshopper position to other positions before the target that are also at a distance of `k`, which could potentially allow the grasshopper to reach the target.

A specific case where the program fails is when the grasshopper can reach the target insect by jumping to the left first and then to the right. The program does not handle this scenario because it only checks for jumps in one direction from the grasshopper to the target.

For example, consider the input:
```
7 3
T...#..G
```
In this case, the grasshopper can jump to the left by 3 steps to reach the target insect. However, the program will not be able to detect this and will incorrectly output "NO".

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible jumps from the grasshopper position, both to the left and to the right, and to check if any of these jumps can lead to the target insect position. This could be achieved by using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm or a similar approach to explore all possible jump paths from the grasshopper position.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n - 1 (inclusive), the input string has a length of n and consists only of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', and the characters 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once. If initially `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the initial value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` is updated to the initial value of `G_pos`, resulting in `G_pos` being less than `T_pos`. If initially `G_pos` is not greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged, with `G_pos` being less than or equal to `T_pos`.
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `True` if there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', and `False` otherwise.
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a path exists from the character 'G' to the character 'T' in the input string, moving in steps of `k`, without encountering a '#'. It takes an integer `n` between 2 and 100 (inclusive), an integer `k` between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once. The function returns 'YES' if such a path exists and 'NO' otherwise, after checking all possible positions in the range from the index of 'G' to the index of 'T' with a step of `k`. The function handles cases where the initial position of 'G' is greater than the position of 'T' by swapping their indices, ensuring that 'G' is always to the left of 'T' before the path search. The function correctly handles edge cases, including when 'G' and 'T' are at adjacent positions or when there are '#' characters blocking the path.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
