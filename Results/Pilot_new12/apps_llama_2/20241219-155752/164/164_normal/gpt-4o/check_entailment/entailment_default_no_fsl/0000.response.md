Correctness: **False**

The provided code only checks if there is a direct path from 'G' to 'T' by jumping with a step of `k` without encountering any obstacles. However, it doesn't consider cases where the grasshopper can jump over obstacles to reach 'T'. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles to reach the target insect. For example, if the input is:

```
7 3
.G...T.
```

In this case, the grasshopper can jump from the first position to the fourth position (over the obstacles) and then to the seventh position, but the program will not find this path because it only checks for obstacles at positions that are exactly `k` steps away from the current position. 

This code should use a more sophisticated approach, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to explore all possible jump paths and find the shortest one that reaches the target insect. The current implementation does not cover all the requirements specified in the problem description.
