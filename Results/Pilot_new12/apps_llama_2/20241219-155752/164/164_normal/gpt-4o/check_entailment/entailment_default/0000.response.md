Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the grasshopper's jumping behavior. It only checks for a path from 'G' to 'T' by moving in steps of 'k' in the forward direction, but it does not consider the possibility of moving in the backward direction when 'G' is to the right of 'T'. 

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the insect 'T' is not reachable by a sequence of jumps of length 'k', even if there are no obstacles '#' in the way. This can happen if the distance between 'G' and 'T' is not a multiple of 'k'. 

For example, if the input is "6 2..GT..", the code will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks for a path by moving in steps of 'k' in the forward direction. However, the correct output should be "NO" because the grasshopper cannot reach the insect 'T' by jumping a distance of 2.

To fix this issue, the code should also consider moving in the backward direction and check if the distance between 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of 'k' or if there is a sequence of jumps that can reach 'T'. 

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 

Input:
6 2
..GT..

In this case, the code outputs "NO" but the explanation for the correct output is that the grasshopper can only jump to cells with even indices, thus it won't be able to reach the insect. However, this does not mean that the code is correct, because the code does not actually check for this condition. 

The correct code should be able to handle all these cases and output the correct result. 

Here is a correct version of the function:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for new_pos in [pos + k, pos - k]:
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and line[new_pos]!= '#' and new_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)
    
    print('NO')
```
This version of the function correctly implements a breadth-first search to check if there is a sequence of jumps that can reach the insect 'T' from the grasshopper 'G'. It handles all cases and outputs the correct result.
