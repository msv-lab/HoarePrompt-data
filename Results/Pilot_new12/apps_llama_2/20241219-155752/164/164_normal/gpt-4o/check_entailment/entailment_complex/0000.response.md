Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles. The current implementation only checks if there are obstacles in the cells that the grasshopper lands on, but it does not check if there are obstacles in the cells that the grasshopper jumps over.

For example, if the input string is "#G.#T#" and k = 2, the program will incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks the cells that the grasshopper lands on (positions 1 and 3), but it does not check the cell that the grasshopper jumps over (position 2).

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are obstacles in the cells that the grasshopper jumps over, not just the cells that it lands on. This can be done by checking the cells between the grasshopper's current position and the target position, not just the target position itself.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly handle this case:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    reachable = False
    current_pos = G_pos
    while current_pos <= T_pos:
        next_pos = current_pos + k
        if next_pos > T_pos:
            break
        if line[next_pos] == '#':
            break
        if any(line[i] == '#' for i in range(current_pos + 1, next_pos)):
            break
        current_pos = next_pos
        if current_pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
```
This modified program checks if there are obstacles in the cells that the grasshopper jumps over by using the `any` function to check if there are any obstacles in the range of cells between the current position and the next position. If there are any obstacles, the program breaks out of the loop and sets `reachable` to `False`. Otherwise, it continues to the next position and checks again.
