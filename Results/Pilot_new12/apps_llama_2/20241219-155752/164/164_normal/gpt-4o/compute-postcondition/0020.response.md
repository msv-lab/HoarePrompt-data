The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a conditional statement. In this case, it causes the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. 

Since `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` must be greater than or equal to `pos`, and `reachable` is `True`, and no changes are made to the values of these variables by the `break` statement.

The `break` statement only changes the control flow of the program, so the values of `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, `pos`, and `reachable` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` must be greater than or equal to `pos`, `reachable` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
