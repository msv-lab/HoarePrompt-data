Postcondition: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`, and the current value of `G_pos` is greater than the current value of `T_pos`**
