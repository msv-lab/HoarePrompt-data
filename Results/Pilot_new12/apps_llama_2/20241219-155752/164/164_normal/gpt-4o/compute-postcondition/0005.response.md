The given code swaps the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`. Initially, `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`. After the swap, `G_pos` will be equal to the initial value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` will be equal to the initial value of `G_pos`. As a result, the new value of `G_pos` will be less than the new value of `T_pos`. 

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `line` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is the initial value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is the initial value of `G_pos`, and the current value of `G_pos` is less than the current value of `T_pos`**
