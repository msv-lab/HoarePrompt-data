Postcondition: ***`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` must be greater than or equal to `pos`. If `line[pos]` is '#', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `reachable` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `reachable` still being `False`.***
