The provided code is a `break` statement. This statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside of. 

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `reachable` is `False`, `T_pos` must be greater than or equal to `pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
