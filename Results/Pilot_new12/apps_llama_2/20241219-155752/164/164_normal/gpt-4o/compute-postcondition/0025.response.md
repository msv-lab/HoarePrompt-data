The given code sets the value of `reachable` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than `T_pos + k`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` must be greater than or equal to `pos - k`, and `reachable` is `True`, and if `line[pos]` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the execution continues**
