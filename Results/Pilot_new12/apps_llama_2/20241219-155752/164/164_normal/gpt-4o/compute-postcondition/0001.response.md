The provided code `line = input()` assigns the input string to the variable `line`. The initial state specifies that `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, the input string has a length of `n` and consists only of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', and the characters 'G' and 'T' each appear exactly once in the string.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once**
