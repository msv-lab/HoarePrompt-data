The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
The `n` is still `input_n`, `k` is still `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is still the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is still less than `T_pos + k`, `pos` is still `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` is still greater than or equal to `pos - k`, and `reachable` is still `True`. 
So the Output State is: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than `T_pos + k`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` is greater than or equal to `pos - k`, `reachable` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than `T_pos + k`, `pos` is `T_pos + k`, `T_pos` is greater than or equal to `pos - k`, `reachable` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
