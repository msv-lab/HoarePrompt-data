The value of `T_pos` is assigned the index of 'T' in `line`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since 'T' appears exactly once in `line`, `line.index('T')` will return the unique index of 'T'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`**
