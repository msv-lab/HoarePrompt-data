Postcondition: ***`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, if `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, then `reachable` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `reachable` remains `False`.***
