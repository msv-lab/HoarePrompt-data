Postcondition: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once. If initially `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the initial value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` is updated to the initial value of `G_pos`, resulting in `G_pos` being less than `T_pos`. If initially `G_pos` is not greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged, with `G_pos` being less than or equal to `T_pos`.**
