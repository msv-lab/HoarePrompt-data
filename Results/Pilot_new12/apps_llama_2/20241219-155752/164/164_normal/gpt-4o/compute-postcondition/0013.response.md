The value of `reachable` is updated to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and `reachable` is `True`.
