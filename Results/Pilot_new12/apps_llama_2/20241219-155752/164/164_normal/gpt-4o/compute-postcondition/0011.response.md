Postcondition: ***`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, if the current value of `line` at position `pos` is '#', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `reachable` remains `False`, otherwise the execution continues with `reachable` still `False`.***
