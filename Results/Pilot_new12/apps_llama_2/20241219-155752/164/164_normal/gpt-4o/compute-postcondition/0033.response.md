Postcondition: ***`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.***
