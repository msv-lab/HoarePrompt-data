Postcondition: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and there is no path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', meaning `reachable` is `False`**
