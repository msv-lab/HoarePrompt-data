The given code snippet is a simple print statement. It does not modify any variables, but rather outputs the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k` and is greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and the current value of `reachable` is `True`, indicating that there is a path from `G_pos` to `T_pos` with a step of `k` without encountering a '#', and 'YES' has been printed**
