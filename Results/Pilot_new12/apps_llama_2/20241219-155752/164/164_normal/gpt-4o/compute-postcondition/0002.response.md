The code `G_pos = line.index('G')` assigns the index of the character 'G' in the string `line` to the variable `G_pos`. Since 'G' appears exactly once in `line`, `G_pos` will be the position of 'G' in `line`, which is a specific integer between 0 and `n-1`, because `line` has length `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' each appearing exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.**
