The function takes no explicit input arguments, but it is expected to receive two lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) where n is the number of cells in the line and k is the length of one grasshopper's jump. The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
