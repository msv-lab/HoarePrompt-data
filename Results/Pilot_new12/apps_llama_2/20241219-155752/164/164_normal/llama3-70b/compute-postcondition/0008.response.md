Given the code `t = i`, we can see that `t` is assigned the value of `i`. 

The value of `i` is given as 0. The character at index `i` of string `s` is given as 'T'. However, this information about `s` and its character at index `i` does not directly affect the assignment of `t`.

So, after executing the code, `t` becomes 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, the current value of `g` is -1, the current value of `t` is 0, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0**
