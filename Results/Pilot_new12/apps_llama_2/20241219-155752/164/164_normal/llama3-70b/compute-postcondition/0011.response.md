According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 1. The values of `s`, `g`, and `t` depend on the character at index `i` of string `s`. Now `i` is 1, so the character at index 1 of string `s` will determine the new values of `g` and `t`. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `g` is -1 and `t` is 0, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is -1 and `t` remains -1**
