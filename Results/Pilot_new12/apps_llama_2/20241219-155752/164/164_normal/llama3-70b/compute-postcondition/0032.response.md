Functionality: **The function determines whether it's possible for a grasshopper to jump from its position 'G' to the target 'T' in a string of length `n`, where the grasshopper can jump `k` steps at a time, and the jump path does not contain any obstacles '#'. The function takes two lines of input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the length of the grasshopper's jump, and the second line contains the string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. The function returns 'YES' if it's possible for the grasshopper to reach the target and 'NO' otherwise. If the input string does not contain 'G' or 'T', the function also returns 'NO'. The function handles edge cases where the grasshopper and the target are at the same position, or where the grasshopper's jump would wrap around the string. After the function concludes, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' to the console, indicating whether the grasshopper can reach the target based on the given input string and constraints.**
