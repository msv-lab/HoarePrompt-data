To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over the string `s` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character, if it's 'G', it updates `g` with the current index; if it's 'T', it updates `t` with the current index. If the character is neither 'G' nor 'T', it doesn't change `g` or `t`.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the pattern:
- `n` remains the same as it's not modified within the loop.
- `k` remains the same as it's not modified within the loop.
- `s` remains the same as it's not modified within the loop.
- `g` and `t` are updated based on the presence of 'G' or 'T' in the string `s`. They initially start at -1, indicating no 'G' or 'T' has been found yet.

Considering the loop will execute `n` times (from `i = 0` to `n-1`), after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because it increments after each iteration.

The key observation is that `g` will hold the index of the last 'G' encountered in the string `s`, and `t` will hold the index of the last 'T' encountered. If no 'G' or 'T' is found, `g` and `t` will remain -1.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
- `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive).
- `s` remains the input string.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes.
- `g` will be the index of the last 'G' in `s`, or -1 if no 'G' is found.
- `t` will be the index of the last 'T' in `s`, or -1 if no 'T' is found.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or -1 if not found, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in `s` or -1 if not found.**
