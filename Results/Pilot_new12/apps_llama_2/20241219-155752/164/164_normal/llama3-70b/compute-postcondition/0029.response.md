Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and the characters at the indices from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed and returned.***
