Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1, meaning both 'G' and 'T' are found in `s`. Additionally, either `abs(t - g)` is not a multiple of `k`, or there exists at least one `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` equals '#'**
