According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so it needs to be adjusted to be 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
