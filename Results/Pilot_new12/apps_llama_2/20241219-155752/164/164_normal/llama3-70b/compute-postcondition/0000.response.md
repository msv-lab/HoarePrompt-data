The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` receives two lines of input, but only processes the first line in this snippet. 

The impact of this code is to assign the values from the first line of input to the variables `n` and `k`. 

The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the number of cells in the line and `k` is the length of one grasshopper's jump. 

The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input and they are integers. 

The preconditions 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1 are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive)**
