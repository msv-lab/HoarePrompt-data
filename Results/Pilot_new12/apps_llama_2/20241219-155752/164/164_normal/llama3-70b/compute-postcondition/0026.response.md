The given code prints 'YES' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in `s`, and the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k`. The string `s` has the property that the characters at the indices from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, are not '#'. The string 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
