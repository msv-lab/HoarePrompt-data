The code `g = i` assigns the value of `i` to `g`. Given that `i` is 1, `g` becomes 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, and `t` remains the same as it was before.

If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `t` is -1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `t` remains -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, `g` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `t` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `t` remains -1**
