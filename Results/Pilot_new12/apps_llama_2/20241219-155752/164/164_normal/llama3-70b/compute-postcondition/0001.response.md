The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `s`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code. 

The value of `s` is an input string, which can be any string. The values of `n` and `k` remain the same: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string**
