Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`. If either the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the index of the last 'T' in `s` (or both) is -1, then 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the indices of the last 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k` and the characters at the indices from the last 'G' to the last 'T' (or the last 'T' to the last 'G'), stepping by `k`, are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. In all other cases, 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
