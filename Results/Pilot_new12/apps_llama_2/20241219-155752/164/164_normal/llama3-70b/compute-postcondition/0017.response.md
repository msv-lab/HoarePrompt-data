The value of `g` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `g` is 2, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `t` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `t` is -1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `g` is 2, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `t` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `t` is -1**
