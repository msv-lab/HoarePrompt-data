The code `t = i` updates the value of `t` to be equal to the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. 

So, `t` is now equal to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `g` is -1 and `t` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is -1 and `t` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `g` is either 0 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', or -1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T' or neither 'G' nor 'T'**
