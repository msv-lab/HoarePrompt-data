Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1 and `t` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 1 and `g` is -1, if the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then `g` is -1 and `t` is -1**
