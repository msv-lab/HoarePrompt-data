#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit input arguments, but it is expected to receive two lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) where n is the number of cells in the line and k is the length of one grasshopper's jump. The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or -1 if not found, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in `s` or -1 if not found.
    if (g == -1 or t == -1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t -
    g) // k + 1))) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and the characters at the indices from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed and returned.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `i` is `n-1`. If either the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the index of the last 'T' in `s` (or both) is -1, then 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the indices of the last 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k` and the characters at the indices from the last 'G' to the last 'T' (or the last 'T' to the last 'G'), stepping by `k`, are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. In all other cases, 'NO' has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether it's possible for a grasshopper to jump from its position 'G' to the target 'T' in a string of length `n`, where the grasshopper can jump `k` steps at a time, and the jump path does not contain any obstacles '#'. The function takes two lines of input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the length of the grasshopper's jump, and the second line contains the string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. The function returns 'YES' if it's possible for the grasshopper to reach the target and 'NO' otherwise. If the input string does not contain 'G' or 'T', the function also returns 'NO'. The function handles edge cases where the grasshopper and the target are at the same position, or where the grasshopper's jump would wrap around the string. After the function concludes, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' to the console, indicating whether the grasshopper can reach the target based on the given input string and constraints.
