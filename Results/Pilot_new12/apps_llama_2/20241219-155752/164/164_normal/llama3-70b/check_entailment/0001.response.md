Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles. The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` checks if all cells on the direct path from the grasshopper to the insect are empty, but it does not consider the possibility that the grasshopper can jump over obstacles.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 2
#T#G##
```
In this case, the program will output "NO" because the direct path from the grasshopper to the insect is blocked by obstacles. However, the grasshopper can actually jump over the obstacles to reach the insect.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use a more advanced algorithm, such as a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to explore all possible jumps and find a path to the insect.

Here is an example of a correct program:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        vis = set()
        q = deque([g])
        vis.add(g)
        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            if u == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for d in [-k, k]:
                v = u + d
                if 0 <= v < n and s[v]!= '#' and v not in vis:
                    q.append(v)
                    vis.add(v)
        print('NO')

```
This program uses a BFS to explore all possible jumps from the grasshopper and find a path to the insect. It correctly handles cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles.
