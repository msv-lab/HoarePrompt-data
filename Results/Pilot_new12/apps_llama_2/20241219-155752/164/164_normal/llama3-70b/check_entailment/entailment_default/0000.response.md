Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not handle all cases as described in the problem. 

For example, let's consider the case where the grasshopper's initial position is 7, the target position is 2, and the string is "G.....T". Here, n = 7, k = 2. According to the problem description, the grasshopper can jump over obstacles and the jump can be to the left or to the right.

However, in this case, the given code does not correctly calculate the jump path. The condition `abs(t - g) % k == 0` only checks if the absolute difference between the target and grasshopper positions is divisible by the jump length, but it does not consider the case where the target is to the left of the grasshopper.

Additionally, the condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` checks if there are no obstacles in the jump path when the grasshopper moves to the right, but it does not correctly handle the case when the grasshopper needs to move to the left or when the jump path wraps around the string.

To fix this, the code should check both left and right directions for the jump path and handle the case where the jump path wraps around the string. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([(g, 0)])
        visited.add(g)
        while queue:
            pos, step = queue.popleft()
            if pos == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for d in [-k, k]:
                np = (pos + d) % n
                if np not in visited and s[np]!= '#':
                    queue.append((np, step + 1))
                    visited.add(np)
        print('NO')
```
