Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The issue lies in the line where it checks if the grasshopper can jump to the target:

`if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))) :`

This line only checks if the absolute difference between the grasshopper's position and the target's position is a multiple of the jump length, and if the cells along this path (stepping by k) are not obstacles. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the grasshopper can jump in both directions (left and right) and that it can wrap around the line.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible jump paths from the grasshopper's position to the target's position.

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to use BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i

    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        queue = deque([g])
        visited = {g}
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for jump in [k, -k]:
                next_pos = (current + jump) % n
                if next_pos not in visited and s[next_pos]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next_pos)
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')
```

This modified program uses BFS to explore all possible jump paths from the grasshopper's position to the target's position, correctly handling the case where the grasshopper can jump in both directions and wrap around the line.
