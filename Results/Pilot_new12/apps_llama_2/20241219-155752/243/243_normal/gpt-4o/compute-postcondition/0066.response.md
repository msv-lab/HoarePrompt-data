To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement: `while func_1(left) == m:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the return value of `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `low` is less than `high`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `left` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute at least one time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. 

Since `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which is the same as `mid`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, it implies that `zeroes` should be equal to `m` for the loop to execute. However, the condition specifically mentions `func_1(left)`, not `func_1(mid)` or `zeroes`. 

But since `left` equals `mid`, the critical condition here is that `func_1(left)` (or equivalently, `func_1(mid)`, given `left` equals `mid`) must return `m`. 

The state does not specify what `func_1` does, so we cannot directly infer what `low` and `high` should be. However, since `left` (and `mid`) are calculated based on `low` and `high`, and `low` is less than `high`, for `func_1(left)` to return `m`, it essentially means that the calculation of `left` (which is `(low + high) // 2`) must lead to a value such that `func_1` of this value equals `m`.

Therefore, the condition that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `func_1(left)` must return `m`, but given the provided state, this translates to ensuring that the conditions are such that `func_1` of the calculated `mid` (or `left`) equals `m`. Since we do not have the specifics of `func_1`, we cannot specify exact values for `low` and `high` but acknowledge that `left` (or `mid`) should be such that it satisfies the loop condition.

Given the provided information and focusing strictly on the condition for the loop to execute, the critical factor is `func_1(left)` equals `m`. The other states provided (`m`'s range, `low` less than `high`, `zeroes` as the return value of `func_1(mid)`, and `result` being an empty list) do not directly impact the loop's ability to execute one time based on the condition `func_1(left) == m`, except insofar as they contribute to the conditions under which `func_1(left)` is evaluated.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, `func_1(left)` must return `m`, and `result` is an empty list**
