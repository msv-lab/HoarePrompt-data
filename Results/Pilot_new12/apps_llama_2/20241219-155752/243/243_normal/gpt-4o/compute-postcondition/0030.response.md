The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that the code is directly inside. The pre-existing conditions and variable values remain unchanged, including the relationships between them.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `right` is the smallest value greater than `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
