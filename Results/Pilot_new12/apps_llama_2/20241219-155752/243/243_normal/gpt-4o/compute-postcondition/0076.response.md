According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `func_1(right)` and `m`. If `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is `mid + 2` and `func_1(left)` does not return `m` for `left` being the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which this condition holds. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must return `m`. Since `right` is `mid + 2`, and we do not have any information about the behavior of `func_1` for values greater than `mid`, we need to adjust the state so that `func_1(right)` returns `m` for `right` being `mid + 2`. 

No changes are needed for `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` as their current values do not affect the condition of the while loop. `left` also does not need to be adjusted because it only affects the loop body, not the loop condition.

State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` must return `m`**
