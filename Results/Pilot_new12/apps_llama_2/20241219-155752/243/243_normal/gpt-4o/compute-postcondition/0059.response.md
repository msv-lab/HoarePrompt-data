To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop, which is `low <= high`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. However, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that this condition still holds true. 

Given the updates to `low` and `high` based on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`, we can see that:
- If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. This could potentially violate the condition `low <= high` if `mid + 1` is greater than `high`.
- If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. This could also potentially violate the condition if `mid - 1` is less than `low`.
- If `zeroes` equals `m`, a list `result` is generated, and there's no direct update to `low` or `high` that would affect the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that after any updates, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. Given the conditions and updates, the critical factor is that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after any update. 

Since `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and this does not directly affect the loop condition, we don't need to adjust `m`. The relationship between `low` and `high` is what determines whether the loop can continue.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and `low` must be less than `high`.**
