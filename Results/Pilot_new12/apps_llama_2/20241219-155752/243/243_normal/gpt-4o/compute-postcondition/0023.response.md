The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial state provides the values and relationships of the variables. 

`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, 
`m` remains unchanged, 
`low` is 0, 
`high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, 
`mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, 
`result` is an empty list, 
`zeroes` equals `m`, 
and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. 

When we increment `right` by 1, we get `right` equals `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`. 

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`**
