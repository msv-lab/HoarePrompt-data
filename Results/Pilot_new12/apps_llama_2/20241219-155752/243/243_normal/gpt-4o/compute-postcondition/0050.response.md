To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
- `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- `right` is `mid + 2`.
- `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`.

The loop condition depends solely on the values of `func_1(right)` and `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. 

Since `right` is `mid + 2`, and we know that `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, for `func_1(right)` to also equal `m`, there's no direct constraint on `m`, `mid`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, or `left` that needs to be adjusted based on the given information. The crucial piece of information is that `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, which implies that the function's behavior around the `mid` value is consistent with the requirement for the loop to continue.

However, since `right` is defined as `mid + 2` and we are given that `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, for the loop to continue, `func_1(mid + 2)` (which is `func_1(right)`) must also equal `m`. There's no explicit constraint in the given states that guarantees `func_1(mid + 2)` equals `m` based on the previous iteration's states. The only adjustment needed for the loop to potentially execute one more time is that `func_1(right)` (or `func_1(mid + 2)`) must equal `m`, but since we don't have direct control over the function's behavior, we focus on the fact that `right` needs to be in a position where `func_1(right)` could potentially equal `m`, given the function's previous behavior.

Thus, no specific adjustments to `m`, `mid`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, or the relationship between `low` and `high` are explicitly required based on the given information, except ensuring that the condition `func_1(right) == m` can be met, which is inherently tied to the behavior of `func_1` and not directly to the values of `m`, `mid`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, or `left`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
