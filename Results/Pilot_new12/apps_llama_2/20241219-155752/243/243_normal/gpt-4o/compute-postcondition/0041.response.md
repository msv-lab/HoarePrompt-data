To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state. The initial state is as follows: 
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` must equal `m`.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `(low + high) // 2`.

The given code snippet is `left -= 1`. This means the value of `left` will be decremented by 1.

Given that `left` is initially `(low + high) // 2`, after decrementing by 1, `left` will become `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.

The other variables (`m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` must equal `m`.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`**
