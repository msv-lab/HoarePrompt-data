To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the states at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is `low <= high`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must hold true. 

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`.
- The updates of `low`, `high`, and `result` depend on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`.

Let's examine the conditions under which `low` and `high` are updated:
1. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`.
2. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `high` is updated to either `5 * (m + 1)` (in the case of `zeroes` equals `m` and specific conditions for `result`) or `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1` (in the case of `zeroes` greater than `m`).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be satisfied. Based on the updates:
- If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` becomes `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`, which is less than `high` (`5 * (m + 1)`), so this scenario naturally satisfies the loop condition without needing further adjustments.
- If `zeroes` equals `m`, the loop breaks under specific conditions, so we don't need to adjust for this case as it doesn't proceed to another iteration.
- If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`. For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to this new `high`. Given that `low` was previously updated to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` when `zeroes` was less than `m`, for the loop to execute again after `zeroes` becomes greater than `m`, it must be the case that `low` and `high` are adjusted so that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

However, based on the given updates and the condition for the loop to execute again, the critical adjustment needed for the loop to proceed is ensuring that `low` is indeed less than or equal to `high` after each iteration. 

The description of state adjustments based on `zeroes` and the updates to `low` and `high` indicates that the loop's ability to continue hinges on the relationship between `low` and `high`. For `low` and `high` to satisfy the loop condition `low <= high` after any update:
- If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to be greater than `mid`, but still less than `high`.
- If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to be less than `mid`, specifically to `mid - 1`.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, considering all paths of updates, are about ensuring `low` and `high` maintain a relationship where `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 

However, the critical insight here is recognizing that the loop condition `low <= high` must be maintained. The provided state descriptions and updates imply that for the loop to continue, `low` and `high` must be such that `low` does not exceed `high` after any iteration, considering the updates based on the `zeroes` value.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.**
