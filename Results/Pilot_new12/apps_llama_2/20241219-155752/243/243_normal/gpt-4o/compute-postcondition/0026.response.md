To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given condition for the `while` loop: `func_1(right) == m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
- `m` remains unchanged
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` equals `m`
- `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`
- `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2)` equals `m`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true. Given that `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2)` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`, it means `func_1(right)` currently does not equal `m` since `right` is not equal to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`. 

To satisfy the loop condition, `right` needs to be adjusted so that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Since we know `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2)` equals `m`, for the loop to execute again, `right` should be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, ideally `right` should be equal to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2` for the condition to be met based on the given information.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`, and `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2)` equals `m`**
