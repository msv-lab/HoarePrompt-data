The value of `mid` is updated to be the average of `low` and `high`. The previous value of `mid` was `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, but this is overwritten by the new calculation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.**
