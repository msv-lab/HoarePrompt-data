To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the variables and their initial states.

Given Initial State:
- `left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `low` remains unchanged.
- `high` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `right` is `mid + 2` and `func_1(right)` must return `m`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
right += 1
```

This code increments the value of `right` by 1.

Given that `right` was `mid + 2`, after executing `right += 1`, `right` becomes `mid + 3`.

The states of `left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `low` remains unchanged.
- `high` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `right` is `mid + 3`.

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is `mid + 3`.**
