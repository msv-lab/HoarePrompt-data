Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`. Additionally, `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m` and `zeroes` is equal to `m`.**
