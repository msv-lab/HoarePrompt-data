The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` assigns to `result` a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. 

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not return `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
