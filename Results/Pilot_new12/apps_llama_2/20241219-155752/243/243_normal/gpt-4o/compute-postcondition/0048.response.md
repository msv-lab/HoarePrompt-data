According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the return value of `func_1(right)`. If `func_1(right)` equals `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `right` is `mid + 1`, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. 

For the loop to execute at least one time, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. There is no direct information about the value of `func_1(right)`, but we know that `right` is `mid + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute, we should assume that `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, but since we don't have any direct relationship between `m` and `func_1(mid + 1)`, we can only conclude that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Given that `right` equals `mid + 1`, this means `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`. 

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is `mid + 1`, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
