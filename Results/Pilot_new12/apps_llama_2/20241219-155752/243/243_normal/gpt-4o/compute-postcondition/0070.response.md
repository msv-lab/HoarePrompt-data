To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement.

1. The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
   - `low` is less than `high`.
   - `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `left` is `mid - 2`.
   - `func_1(mid - 1)` must return `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.

Given that the loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`, for the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` after the previous iteration. 

Since `left` is defined as `mid - 2`, and we know `func_1(mid - 1)` returns `m`, there's no direct information that guarantees `func_1(left)` will return `m` without knowing more about `func_1`. However, since `left` is `mid - 2`, and we want the loop to potentially execute again based on the same condition, we need to consider how `func_1` behaves.

Given the provided conditions, for the loop to potentially execute one more time, we don't need to adjust `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `result` directly because the loop's continuation is solely based on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The critical aspect here is ensuring that the condition `func_1(left) == m` can still be true after the previous iteration.

Since we are not provided with the specifics of `func_1`'s behavior, we must infer from the given state. If `func_1(mid - 1)` returns `m`, and we want `func_1(left)` to return `m` as well (where `left = mid - 2`), it implies that `func_1` should return `m` for the value of `left` after the previous iteration.

However, without explicitly knowing how `func_1` behaves for different inputs, we can only state what we know and what must be true for the loop to potentially execute again: `func_1(left)` must equal `m`, which means `left` must be a value that results in `m` when passed to `func_1`.

Thus, considering the provided information and focusing strictly on the loop condition, we need to ensure that after the previous iteration, the conditions that allow `func_1(left)` to potentially return `m` are still met. Since `func_1(mid - 1)` must return `m`, and `left` is defined as `mid - 2`, for the loop to execute again, it must be possible for `func_1` to return `m` for `left`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `func_1(mid - 1)` must return `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `func_1(left)` must return `m`**
