The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, so the new value of `left` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`**
