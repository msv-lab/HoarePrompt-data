The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, we can express `low` as `(mid + high) // 2` before the update and `mid` as `(low + high) // 2` which makes `low` less than `mid` and `high` greater than `mid`, and `mid` and `high` will still keep that property after the update because `low` becomes greater than `mid`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` before `low` update, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is `mid + 1`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.
