To find the output state after running the given Python code based on the initial state, we analyze the code and the initial conditions:

- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.
- The code is `high = mid - 1`.

Given the code `high = mid - 1`, we understand that the variable `high` is being updated to be one less than the current value of `mid`. The values of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and the relationship between `low` and `high` are not directly altered by this line of code, except for the new value of `high` which now affects the `low` and `high` relationship.

Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, changing `high` to `mid - 1` will effectively change the range between `low` and `high` but does not directly change `low` or `mid` in this specific step. However, `mid` is dependent on `low` and `high`, so its calculation may need to be reconsidered based on the new value of `high` in subsequent steps.

The output state therefore maintains the initial conditions with the update that `high` is now `mid - 1`, and by extension, this could potentially affect how `mid` and the relationship between `low` and `high` are considered in the context of the overall algorithm or subsequent calculations.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` was `(low + high) // 2` before the update, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `high` is now `mid - 1`, and the relationship between `low` and `high` is updated with `high` being `mid - 1`, which may necessitate a recalculation of `mid` based on the updated `high` and the constraint that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.**
