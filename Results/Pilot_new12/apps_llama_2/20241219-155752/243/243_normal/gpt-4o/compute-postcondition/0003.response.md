According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`. Since `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `high` will always be greater than `low`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list**
