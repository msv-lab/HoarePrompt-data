Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1` or `(low + high_prev) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not return `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, at which point we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `m`, `low`, `mid`, `zeroes` remaining unchanged.**
