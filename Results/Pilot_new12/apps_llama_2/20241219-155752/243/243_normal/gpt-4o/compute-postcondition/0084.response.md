Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then either `high` is updated to `mid - 1` or `(low + high_prev) // 2 - 1`, or `left` and `right` are found such that `func_1(left)` and `func_1(right)` do not return `m`, and a list `result` is generated containing integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `m`, `low`, `mid`, `zeroes` remaining unchanged in the latter case.**
