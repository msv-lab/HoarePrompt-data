The code updates the value of `zeroes` to be the return value of `func_1(mid)`. The previous value of `zeroes`, which was `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`, is overwritten. The values of `m`, `mid`, `low`, and `high` are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.**
