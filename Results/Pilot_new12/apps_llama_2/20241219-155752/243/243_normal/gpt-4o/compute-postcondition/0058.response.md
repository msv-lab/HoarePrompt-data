Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then either `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, or a list `result` is generated containing numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value (incrementing from `mid + 1`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, when `zeroes` equals `m`.***
