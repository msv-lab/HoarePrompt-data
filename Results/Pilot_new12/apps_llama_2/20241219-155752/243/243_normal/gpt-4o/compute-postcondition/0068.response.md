According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` returning the value `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `func_1(left)` must return `m`, and `left` is `mid - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still return `m` after the state adjustment. Since `left` is `mid - 1` and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and we know `low` is less than `high`, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` can still return `m` after the adjustment.

The state of `m` as a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not changed by the loop condition. The state of `result` as an empty list also does not need to be adjusted, as it is not related to the loop condition.

However, we need to ensure that the relationship between `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `left` can still satisfy the loop condition after adjustment. The current values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `left` are such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`. 

To guarantee that `func_1(left)` can still return `m` in the next iteration, we need to ensure that the updated `left` can still produce `m` when input into `func_1`. Since the current `left` is `mid - 1`, if we were to adjust `low` and `high` such that `mid` changes, `left` would also change. 

Given these considerations, we should focus on the condition that must hold for the loop to execute again: `func_1(left)` must return `m`. The adjustment of `low` and `high` should aim to preserve this condition.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` must return `m`, and `result` is an empty list**
