To determine the final output state of the loop, we can analyze the pattern from the given output states after the loop executes a certain number of times. The key observations are:

1. **`right` Increases**: With each iteration, `right` increases by 1. This is directly from the loop code `right += 1`.
2. **Condition for Iteration**: For the loop to execute at least once, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`. For it to execute twice, `func_1(mid + 1)` and `func_1(mid + 2)` must both equal `m`, and so on. This implies that the loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate when `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. At this point, `right` will be the first value (incrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Given these observations:

- **`m`** remains unchanged as it's a constant within the scope of this loop.
- **`mid`** is the average of `low` and `high`, but its value does not change within the loop. `low` and `high` are also unchanged.
- **`zeroes`** is the return value of `func_1(mid)` but does not change within the loop.
- **`result`** is an empty list initially, but there is no operation within the loop that modifies `result`, so it remains an empty list.
- **`left`** is defined as the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, but its value is not updated within the given loop. It's a definition based on `mid` and `func_1`, but the loop only increments `right`.
- **`right`** increases by 1 with each iteration until `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. At the end of the loop, `right` will be the first value (incrementing from `mid + 1`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Thus, the loop's output state after all iterations have executed will have `right` as the first value (incrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, with all other variables retaining their initial values or definitions based on the original values of `mid`, `low`, `high`, and `m`.

Output State: **`right` is the first value (incrementing from `mid + 1`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of the original `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` based on the original `mid`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is defined as the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, based on the original `mid` and the definition of `func_1`.**
