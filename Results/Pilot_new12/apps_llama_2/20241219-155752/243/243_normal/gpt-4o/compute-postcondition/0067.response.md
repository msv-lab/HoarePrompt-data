To calculate the output state, we need to understand the changes made by the given code snippet.

The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which is the same as `mid`. After the decrease, `left` becomes `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.

Other variables such as `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `result` are not directly affected by this operation. The condition that `func_1(left)` must return `m` is still valid, but now `left` has a new value. 

Given that `left` is now `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, and considering that `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`, we can conclude that `left` is one less than `mid`.

The value of `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is still less than `high`, and `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `func_1(left)` must return `m`, and `result` is an empty list**
