Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is either `5 * (m + 1)` or `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `zeroes` is either greater than `m` or equals `m`, and `result` is either an empty list or a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are determined based on the condition of `func_1(left)` not equaling `m` and `func_1(right)` not equaling `m` respectively, if `zeroes` equals `m`, otherwise `result` remains unchanged; if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`, otherwise the loop breaks with the described `result` and `right` as the smallest value greater than `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.**
