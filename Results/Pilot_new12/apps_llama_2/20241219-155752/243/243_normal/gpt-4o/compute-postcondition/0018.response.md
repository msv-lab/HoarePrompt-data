According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` being equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is `left - 1`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `func_1(left - 1)` must be equal to `m`. Since we don't have any information about the function `func_1`, we cannot determine its output directly. However, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left - 1)` should be equal to `m`, which means `left` must be in a state such that `func_1(left - 1)` equals `m`.

Other states like `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, and `zeroes` do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left - 1)` equals `m`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`**
