Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `high` is either `5 * (m + 1)` or `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `result` is either an empty list or a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are determined based on the condition of `func_1(left)` not equaling `m` and `func_1(right)` not equaling `m` respectively. In the case where `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` remains unchanged and the loop breaks with the described `result` and `right` as the smallest value greater than `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
