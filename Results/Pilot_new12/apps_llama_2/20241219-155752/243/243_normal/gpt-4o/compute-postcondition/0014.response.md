To ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can only analyze based on the given condition and the states provided.

Given that `left` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2` and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, for the loop to execute, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we cannot directly infer how `left` or `m` should be adjusted to satisfy this condition, as `func_1`'s behavior is unknown.

However, the loop's condition does not directly depend on `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, or `zeroes`. It solely depends on the relationship between `func_1(left)` and `m`. Thus, for the loop to certainly execute one time, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m` at the start.

Given that we cannot alter the behavior of `func_1` or know its specifics, and assuming the code is structured such that `func_1` could potentially return a value equal to `m` under the given conditions, the state adjustments should focus on ensuring that the loop condition could be met based on the information provided.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and it must be possible for `func_1(left)` to equal `m`**
