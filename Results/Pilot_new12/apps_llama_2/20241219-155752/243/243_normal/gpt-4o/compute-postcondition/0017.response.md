The code provided decrements the value of `left` by 1. The initial state provides the following information: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`.

After decrementing `left` by 1, the new value of `left` becomes `left - 1`. However, without knowing the exact function `func_1`, we cannot determine how this change affects the relationship between `left` and `m`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` is `left - 1` (which was initially such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`), and `zeroes` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` is `left - 1`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`.**
