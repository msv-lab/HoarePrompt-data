To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and `low` must be less than `high`. The code calculates `mid` as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Given the initial conditions:
- `m` is a positive integer, `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `low` is less than `high`.

The code executed is:
```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

This code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result of the division. 

Since `low` is less than `high`, and both are integers (their specific types aren't mentioned but based on the context of comparison and division, we can infer they are integers or at least behave as integers in this operation), `mid` will be an integer that is either exactly midway between `low` and `high` if their sum is even, or it will be the integer just below the exact midpoint if their sum is odd.

The value of `m` is not directly affected by this operation, and `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Only `mid` is introduced or updated.

Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions with the addition of `mid` being the integer average of `low` and `high`, which can be expressed as `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
