Based on the given information, we can analyze the loop's behavior as follows:

- The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` returns `m`.
- In each iteration, `left` is decremented by 1.
- The loop will stop when `func_1(left)` no longer returns `m`.

From the output states after executing the loop 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer the following patterns:

- `left` decreases by 1 in each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to execute at least `n` times is that `func_1(mid - (n - 1))` must return `m`.

Given that the loop will continue until `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, we can conclude that the final state of `left` will be the smallest value for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, while `func_1(left + 1)` does return `m`.

Considering that the initial value of `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, and it decreases by 1 in each iteration, the loop will eventually stop when `func_1(left)` does not return `m`. This means that `left` will be the first value from `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop have executed will include the final value of `left`, which is the first value from the original `mid` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, and the other variables remain unchanged as per the given loop code.

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, and `result` remains an empty list**
