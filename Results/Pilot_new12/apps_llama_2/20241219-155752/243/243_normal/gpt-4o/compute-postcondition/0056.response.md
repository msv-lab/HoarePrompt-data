The code snippet is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`result` is a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `m` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of the original `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` based on the original `mid`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value (incrementing from `mid + 1`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
