The code assigns `mid + 1` to the variable `right`. The previous values of `left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is `mid + 1`**
