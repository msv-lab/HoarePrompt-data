The code changes the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`. 

`low` is now `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)` which is less than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2)` which is less than `m`.**
