The given code snippet is `result = list(range(left + 1, right))`. 

`left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value (incrementing from `mid + 1`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. 

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`. The `list()` function then converts this sequence into a list.

The states of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and the definitions of `func_1`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`result` is a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `m` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of the original `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` based on the original `mid`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value (incrementing from `mid + 1`) for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.**
