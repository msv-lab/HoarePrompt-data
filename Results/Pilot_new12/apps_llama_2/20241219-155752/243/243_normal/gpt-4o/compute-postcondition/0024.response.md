To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the provided program state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop statement is: 
```
while func_1(right) == m:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `func_1(right) == m` is met.

Given program state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
- `m` remains unchanged
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` equals `m`
- `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be satisfied. Since we do not have any information about the function `func_1` or its behavior, the only adjustment we can reason about is related to the condition itself.

At the end of the previous iteration, we do not know if `func_1(right)` equals `m` or not because `right` is defined but its relation to `m` through `func_1` is not explicitly stated as equal. However, for the loop to proceed, it must be that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`, and `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
