To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while func_1(right) == m`. This loop will continue to execute as long as the function `func_1(right)` returns the value `m`.

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `low` remains unchanged.
- `high` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `right` is `mid + 3`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must still be true. However, since `right` is `mid + 3` and we do not have information about the behavior of `func_1` at `mid + 3`, we cannot directly infer the outcome of `func_1(right)` based on the given states.

However, considering that the loop is conditional on `func_1(right)` returning `m`, and knowing that `left` is defined as the first value from `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, it implies that for values less than `left`, `func_1` might return `m`. The condition of the loop suggests that `right` should be in a state where `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to continue.

Given that `right` is `mid + 3`, and considering the loop's condition depends solely on the value of `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`, the critical adjustment is ensuring that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m`. Since we cannot alter the function's behavior or the value of `m`, the states provided do not directly influence the loop's continuation except for the requirement that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

Therefore, the states do not need adjustment in terms of their current values (`left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`) because the loop's condition hinges on `func_1(right)` returning `m`. The loop can only proceed if this condition is met, and since we are given `right` is `mid + 3`, we must infer that `func_1` at this `right` should still return `m` for the loop to continue, without altering the other states directly based on the given information.

State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is `mid + 3` with the understanding that `func_1(right)` must return `m`**
