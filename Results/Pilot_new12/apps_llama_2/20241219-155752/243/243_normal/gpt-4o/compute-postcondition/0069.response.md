The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Initially, `left` is `mid - 1`, so after the decrement, `left` becomes `mid - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `func_1(mid - 1)` must return `m`, and `result` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `func_1(mid - 1)` must return `m`, and `result` is an empty list**
