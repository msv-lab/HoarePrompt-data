According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left` and the function `func_1(left)` returning a value equal to `m`. For the loop to execute at least one time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. Given that `left` is `(low + high) // 2` and `mid` is also `(low + high) // 2`, it implies that `left` and `mid` have the same value. Since `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` and we want `func_1(left)` to equal `m`, it means `zeroes` should also equal `m` for the loop to potentially execute, considering `left` and `mid` are equal.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2`**
