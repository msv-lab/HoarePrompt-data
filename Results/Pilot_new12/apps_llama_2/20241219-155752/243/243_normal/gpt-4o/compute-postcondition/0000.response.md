To solve this problem, we need to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of `n!`, since each pair of 2 and 5 contributes a factor of 10. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we just need to count the number of factors of 5.

The number of factors of 5 in `n!` can be calculated using the formula: `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +...`, where `//` denotes integer division.

Let's denote the result of this calculation as `k`. Then, we are looking for all `n` such that `k == m`.

However, without a specific Python code snippet, we cannot determine the exact output state. 

But based on the initial condition and problem description: 
The initial state is that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and we are looking for all `n` such that `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`.**
