To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
   - `low` is less than `high`.
   - `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, which implies `mid` is an integer since it's the result of integer division in Python.

2. **Code**: 
   - `zeroes = func_1(mid)`

Given the initial state and the code, the impact of the code on the program is the assignment of the result of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, so we cannot determine its exact behavior or return value. However, we can infer that:

- The value of `zeroes` will be whatever `func_1` returns when given `mid` as an argument.
- The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` are not changed by the code, as there are no operations performed on these variables.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the code's effect:

- `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
- `low` remains less than `high`.
- `mid` remains `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, which is unknown without the definition of `func_1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.**
