To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. This means the loop will decrement `left` until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

2. **Initial State and Updates**:
   - `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
   - `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` starts as the average of `low` and `high`.

3. **Output States After Loop Executes**:
   - After 1 iteration: `left` is decremented by 1, indicating `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` at the start.
   - After 2 iterations: `left` is decremented by 2, suggesting `func_1(left)` remained equal to `m` after the first decrement.
   - After 3 iterations: The pattern continues, with `left` being decremented further until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

Given this pattern, the loop will continue to decrement `left` as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. When `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, the loop will terminate.

**Output State Calculation**:
- Since the loop decrements `left` until `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, we can deduce that upon termination, `left` will be the first value (starting from the initial average of `low` and `high` and moving downwards) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is used for comparison and does not get updated.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and `result` do not get updated within the loop provided. Thus, their values remain as initially set or updated before the loop, with the exception that `result` remains empty as there are no operations in the loop that modify it.
- `left` is the variable that changes, and its final value is the first value (decrementing from the initial `mid`) where `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.

Therefore, considering the information and the pattern observed:
- `m` retains its original value.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high` retain their initial or pre-loop updated values.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, and its final value is the first such decrement where this condition is not met.

**Output State: `m` remains unchanged, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high` retain their pre-loop values, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is the first value (starting from the initial average of `low` and `high` and decrementing) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`.**
