The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The previous value of `right` was `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`. 

The new value of `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, 
`m` remains unchanged, 
`low` is 0, 
`high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, 
`mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, 
`result` is an empty list, 
`zeroes` equals `m`, 
`right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`, 
and `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2)` equals `m`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`, and `func_1(5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2)` equals `m`.**
