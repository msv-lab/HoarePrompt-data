To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition that must be met for the loop to proceed: `func_1(right) == m`.

Given the states:
- `left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
- `m` remains unchanged
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` equals `m`
- `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`

The condition `func_1(right) == m` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Since we do not have information about the function `func_1`, we can only adjust the state based on the given condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Given that `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`, and considering the other states, the only thing we can deduce is that the function `func_1` should return `m` when given the current value of `right`.

No specific adjustments to `left`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`, or `zeroes` are directly implied by the condition of the loop, as the loop's condition solely depends on `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`. The initial states provided do not directly influence whether `func_1(right)` equals `m`, except for the value of `right` and the fact that `m` remains unchanged.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we must ensure `func_1(right)` equals `m`, given the current `right` value. All other states remain as initially described, without needing further specifications to guarantee one iteration of the loop.

State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
