The code initializes an empty list `result`. This operation does not affect the values of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, or `high`. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`, and `result` is an empty list.**
