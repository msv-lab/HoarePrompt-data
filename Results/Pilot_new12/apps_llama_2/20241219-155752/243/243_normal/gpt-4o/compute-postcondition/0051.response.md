The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `right` is `mid + 2`. The updated value of `right` becomes `mid + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is `mid + 3`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, and `func_1(mid + 2)` must equal `m`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is `mid + 3`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, and `func_1(mid + 2)` must equal `m`**
