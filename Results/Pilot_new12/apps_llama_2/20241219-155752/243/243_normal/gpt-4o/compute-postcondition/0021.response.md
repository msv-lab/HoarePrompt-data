`right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`, where `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1**
