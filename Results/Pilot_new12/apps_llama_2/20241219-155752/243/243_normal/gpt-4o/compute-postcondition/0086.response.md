Output State: **The program returns a list of numbers `result` that contains all numbers `n` within the determined range where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, or an empty list if no such solution exists, with `m` being the original value and the determined range being between `low` and `high` where `low` is greater than `high` and `high` is less than or equal to `5 * (m + 1)`**
