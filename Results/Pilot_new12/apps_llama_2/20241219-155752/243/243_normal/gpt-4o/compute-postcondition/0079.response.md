`right` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `right` is `mid + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is `mid + 4`**
