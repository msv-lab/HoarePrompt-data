To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. This means the loop will stop when `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.
2. In each iteration, `right` is incremented by 1.
3. The initial value of `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`.
4. The output state after the loop executes some number of times shows a pattern where `right` increases by 1 in each iteration, as long as the condition `func_1(right)` equals `m` is met.

Considering these points, the loop will execute until `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. At this point, `right` will be the smallest value greater than its initial value for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Given the increments of `right` in each iteration, the final value of `right` will be the first value for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, starting from its initial value `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1`.

Other variables like `left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`, and `zeroes` do not change within the loop, so their values remain as initially stated.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.**
