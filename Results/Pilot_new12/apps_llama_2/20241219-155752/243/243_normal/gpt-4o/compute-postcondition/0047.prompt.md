You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. This means the loop will decrement `left` until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

2. **Initial State and Updates**:
   - `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
   - `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` starts as the average of `low` and `high`.

3. **Output States After Loop Executes**:
   - After 1 iteration: `left` is decremented by 1, indicating `func_1(left)` was equal to `m` at the start.
   - After 2 iterations: `left` is decremented by 2, suggesting `func_1(left)` remained equal to `m` after the first decrement.
   - After 3 iterations: The pattern continues, with `left` being decremented further until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

Given this pattern, the loop will continue to decrement `left` as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. When `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, the loop will terminate.

**Output State Calculation**:
- Since the loop decrements `left` until `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`, we can deduce that upon termination, `left` will be the first value (starting from the initial average of `low` and `high` and moving downwards) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is used for comparison and does not get updated.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and `result` do not get updated within the loop provided. Thus, their values remain as initially set or updated before the loop, with the exception that `result` remains empty as there are no operations in the loop that modify it.
- `left` is the variable that changes, and its final value is the first value (decrementing from the initial `mid`) where `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.

Therefore, considering the information and the pattern observed:
- `m` retains its original value.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high` retain their initial or pre-loop updated values.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, and its final value is the first such decrement where this condition is not met.

**Output State: `m` remains unchanged, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high` retain their pre-loop values, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is the first value (starting from the initial average of `low` and `high` and decrementing) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`.**
```
right = mid + 1

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
