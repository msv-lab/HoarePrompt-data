The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `left` must be such that `func_1(left - 1)` equals `m`, the new `left` should be such that `func_1(left - 1 - 1)` equals `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left - 2)` equals `m`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left - 2)` equals `m`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`**
