The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, but the code does not change these values. 
The value of `m` is still a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is still less than `high`, and `result` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list**
