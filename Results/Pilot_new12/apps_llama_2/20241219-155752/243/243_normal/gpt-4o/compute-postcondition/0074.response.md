To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given condition in the `while` loop statement, which is `func_1(right) == m`. For this loop to execute at least once, the condition must be true. 

Given:
- `left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `low` remains unchanged.
- `high` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `right` is `mid + 1`.

The loop can execute if `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Since `right` is `mid + 1`, for the loop to execute, `func_1(mid + 1)` must return `m`. There's no direct information about the value of `func_1(mid + 1)`, but since `left` is defined as the first value from `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, and given that `right` is `mid + 1`, it implies that `mid` could potentially be the value from which `func_1(mid)` does return `m` because `left` is the first such value where `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, found by moving downwards from `(low + high) // 2`.

However, the critical piece of information for the loop to execute is that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Given that `right = mid + 1`, and we want the loop to execute at least once, it must be the case that `func_1(mid + 1)` returns `m`. Since we do not have direct information that guarantees `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`, but we know `right` needs to satisfy this condition for the loop to run, the state regarding `func_1(right)` or the relationship of `right` to `m` through `func_1` needs clarification.

But to simplify, since `right` is defined and `m` is unchanged, for the loop to execute, `func_1(right)` needs to equal `m`. The provided states about `left`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` do not directly affect the condition for the loop to start executing, given that `right` and `m` are the variables involved in the loop condition.

Thus, focusing on the necessary condition for the loop to execute, we see that no additional adjustments are needed beyond what's already given, except ensuring that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, which means `right` must be in a state where `func_1` of it returns `m`. Given that `right = mid + 1`, and we're working with the information provided about `left` and the search for a value where `func_1` does or does not return `m`, the critical insight is ensuring that `right` (or `mid + 1`) satisfies the loop's condition.

State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is `mid + 1` and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.**
