To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

Given states:
- `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
- `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- `right` is `mid + 3`.
- `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`.
- `func_1(mid + 2)` must equal `m`.

Since the loop condition depends on `func_1(right) == m` and we know that `right` is `mid + 3`, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(mid + 3)` must also equal `m`. The current states provided do not directly guarantee that `func_1(right)` (or `func_1(mid + 3)`) equals `m`, but we have information about `func_1(mid + 1)` and `func_1(mid + 2)` equaling `m`. To ensure the loop can execute again based on the given condition, we need to consider the implication of `right` being `mid + 3` and the requirement for `func_1(right)` to equal `m`.

Adjusting states based on the requirement for the loop to execute one more time, we see that:
- The condition of `func_1(mid + 1)` and `func_1(mid + 2)` equaling `m` already provides some insight into the behavior of `func_1` around `mid`.
- However, to ensure `func_1(right) == m` for the next iteration, given `right` is `mid + 3`, we need `func_1(mid + 3)` to equal `m` for the loop to execute again.

The provided states about `m`, `mid`, `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, and the specific values of `func_1` at `mid + 1` and `mid + 2` do not directly need adjustment for the loop condition to be possible. However, the critical adjustment is in understanding that for the loop to continue, `func_1(mid + 3)` (which is `func_1(right)`) must equal `m`, which is not explicitly stated in the given states but is implied as a necessity for the loop's next iteration.

State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is `mid + 3`, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`, `func_1(mid + 2)` must equal `m`, and `func_1(mid + 3)` must equal `m`**
