According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and the function `func_1(left)` which should return `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. Since we do not know the implementation details of `func_1`, we cannot directly adjust `left`. However, we can infer that since `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1` and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, for `func_1(left)` to still equal `m`, `left` should be adjusted so that it still satisfies the condition `func_1(left) == m`. 

However, as `left` is calculated based on `low` and `high`, we should ensure that the relation between `low` and `high` allows `left` to be in a state where `func_1(left)` could potentially equal `m`. Given `left` is one less than `mid`, and `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, for `left` to potentially satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m` after the previous iteration, `low` and `high` must be such that they can produce a new `left` that satisfies the condition. 

But since the actual condition that matters is `func_1(left) == m`, and we do not know how `func_1` behaves, we must ensure that the state allows for the possibility of `func_1(left)` equaling `m` again. Thus, the critical adjustment is conceptual, ensuring that `left` can potentially lead to `func_1(left) == m`, but without specific knowledge of `func_1`, we cannot explicitly adjust `left`, `low`, or `high` without more context.

Therefore, considering the lack of information about `func_1` and its behavior, and focusing strictly on the provided state and the condition for the loop to continue, we acknowledge that the loop's continuation depends on a condition that involves an external function's behavior, which we cannot directly influence without additional details.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`**
