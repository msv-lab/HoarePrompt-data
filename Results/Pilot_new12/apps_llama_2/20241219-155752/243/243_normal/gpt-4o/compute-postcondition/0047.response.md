To determine the output state after the given code executes, let's analyze the provided information step by step.


1. **Previous State**: Before executing the line `right = mid + 1`, the state of the variables is as follows:
   - `m` remains unchanged, a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
   - `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` is the first value (starting from the initial average of `low` and `high` and decrementing) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`.

2. **Code Execution**: The code `right = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to the variable `right`.

3. **Output State Calculation**:
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged.
   - `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high` retain their pre-loop values.
   - `result` remains an empty list.
   - `left` retains its final value from the previous loop, which is the first value (starting from the initial average of `low` and `high` and decrementing) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`.
   - A new variable `right` is introduced and assigned the value of `mid + 1`.

Therefore, considering the information and the code execution:
- `m` retains its original value.
- `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high` retain their pre-loop values.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `left` retains its value as the first decrement from the initial average of `low` and `high` where `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value (decrementing from `mid`) for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 1`.**
