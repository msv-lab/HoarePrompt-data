The code decreases the value of `left` by 1. Given that `left` is initially `mid - 2`, after the decrease, `left` becomes `mid - 3`. The other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`) and conditions (`1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `func_1(mid - 1)` returns `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `func_1(left)` returns `m`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 3`, `result` is an empty list, `func_1(mid - 1)` returns `m`, and `func_1(left)` returns `m`**
