The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, but since `high` has been updated, we need to consider the previous value of `high`. Let's denote the previous value of `high` as `high_prev`. Then, `mid` is `(low + high_prev) // 2`. 

Now, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, which is `((low + high_prev) // 2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high_prev) // 2`, `high` is `(low + high_prev) // 2 - 1`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high_prev) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1` or `(low + high_prev) // 2 - 1`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`**
