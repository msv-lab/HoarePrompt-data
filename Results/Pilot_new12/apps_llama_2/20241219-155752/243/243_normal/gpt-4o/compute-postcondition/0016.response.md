To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must examine the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`. 

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the result of `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Since `m` is a fixed value within the range `1 <= m <= 100000` and is also equal to `zeroes`, the key to whether the loop can execute again lies in the value of `left` and the behavior of `func_1(left)`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1(left)`**: Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only infer that for the loop to continue, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. This implies that the value of `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

3. **Current State of Variables**:
   - `m` is a positive integer, `1 <= m <= 100000`.
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`.
   - `left` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - `zeroes` is equal to `m`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still return `m`. Since `left` is calculated based on `m` and the loop body is not provided, we cannot accurately predict how `left` or `m` would change within the loop body. However, we know that for the condition to hold true for another iteration, the relationship between `left` and `m` through `func_1(left)` must remain consistent.

Given the lack of specific details about `func_1` and how the variables are modified within the loop body, we cannot precisely adjust the states without making assumptions. However, based on the condition provided:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `zeroes` is equal to `m`** 

This description acknowledges the necessity for `func_1(left)` to equal `m` without specifying how `left` or other variables should be adjusted, given the absence of details on `func_1` and the loop body's operations.
