To find the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can analyze the pattern from the given examples and apply it to the loop's code.

The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` returns `m`. In each iteration, `right` is incremented by 1. This means the loop will stop when it finds a `right` value for which `func_1(right)` does not return `m`.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that `left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged, while `right` increases by 1 in each iteration.

The key to understanding the final output state is recognizing that `right` will keep incrementing as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. Once `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, the loop will terminate.

Therefore, the loop's output state, after all iterations have executed, can be described as follows: `left` remains the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged. The value of `right` will be the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not return `m`, because that's when the loop condition is no longer met, causing the loop to terminate.

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `result` remains an empty list, and `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not return `m`.**
