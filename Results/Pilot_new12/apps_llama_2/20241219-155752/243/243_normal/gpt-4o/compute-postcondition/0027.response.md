The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial value of `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2`. 

The new value of `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 3`**
