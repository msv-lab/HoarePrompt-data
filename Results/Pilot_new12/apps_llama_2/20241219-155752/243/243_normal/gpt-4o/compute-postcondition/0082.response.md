The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`left` is the first value from the original `(low + high) // 2` downwards for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` remains unchanged, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `zeroes` remains unchanged, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not return `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
