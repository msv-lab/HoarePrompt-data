The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `low` was less than `high`, and `mid` was the average of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` is `mid + 1 = ((low + high) // 2) + 1`. The value of `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, and `zeroes` is still the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is greater than `low`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`**
