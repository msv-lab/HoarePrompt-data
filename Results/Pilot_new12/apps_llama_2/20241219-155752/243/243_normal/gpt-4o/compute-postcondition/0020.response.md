To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to understand the condition that stops the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`. With each iteration, `left` is decremented by 1. This means the loop will stop when `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, or in other words, when `left` reaches a value such that `func_1(left)` does not return `m`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe that `left` starts at `5 * (m + 1) // 2` and is decremented by 1 with each iteration. The variables `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`, and `zeroes` do not change within the loop.

When the loop stops, `left` will be such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`. This could happen for various reasons depending on what `func_1` does, but the loop's condition is the key. 

Since `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, once the loop ends, `left` will have the smallest value for which `func_1(left)` does not return `m`, or it will be the value right before that, depending on the exact nature of `func_1`. However, without the definition of `func_1`, we can only describe the termination condition in terms of `func_1(left)` not equaling `m`.

Other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`, `zeroes`) do not change inside the loop, so their final state remains the same as their initial state, except for `left`, which is decremented until the loop condition is no longer met.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is an empty list, and `zeroes` equals `m`.**
