The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after updates based on `zeroes` relative to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid` which is `(low + high) // 2`.
