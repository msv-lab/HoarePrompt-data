Based on the provided information and the loop's behavior, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be determined as follows:

- The loop will continue to execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 
- When `zeroes` equals `m`, the loop breaks, and `result` is updated to contain all numbers `n` such that `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m` within the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` and `right` are the first values for which `func_1(left)` and `func_1(right)` do not equal `m`, respectively.
- If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. This process continues until `zeroes` equals `m` or `low` is greater than `high`.
- Once the loop breaks, `low` will be greater than `high` if no solution is found, or `result` will contain the list of numbers `n` that satisfy the given condition.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.

Considering these points, the output state of the loop can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, and if a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, then `result` contains all such numbers `n` within the determined range; otherwise, `result` remains an empty list. The original value of `m` remains unchanged, and `high` will be less than or equal to the original `high` which is `5 * (m + 1)`.**
