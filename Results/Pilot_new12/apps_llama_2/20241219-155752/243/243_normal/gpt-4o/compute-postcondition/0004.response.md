`mid` is assigned the value of the average of `low` and `high`, which is `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, we can substitute these values into the equation. 
So, `mid` becomes `(0 + 5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2` or `5 * (m + 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, and `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, and `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`**
