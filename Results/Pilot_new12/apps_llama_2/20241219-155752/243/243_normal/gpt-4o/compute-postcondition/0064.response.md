The given Python code initializes an empty list called `result`. 

The value of `m` is still a positive integer, `low` is still less than `high`, `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is still the return value of `func_1(mid)`. The states of these variables are not affected. 

However, a new variable `result` is introduced and is assigned an empty list value.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `low` is less than `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list.**
