To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`.

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can only infer based on the given states and the loop condition.

2. **Analyzing the Given States**:
   - `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`.
   - `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `zeroes` must equal `m`.
   - `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 2`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The critical variable in the loop condition is `left`, as it directly affects the outcome of `func_1(left)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. Since we don't know the nature of `func_1`, we cannot directly infer how `left` should be adjusted based on its current definition `(low + high) // 2 - 2`.
   - However, given that `left` is defined in terms of `low` and `high`, and considering the loop condition, we need to ensure that any adjustment to `low` and `high` does not violate the condition `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, and that `func_1(left)` can potentially still equal `m` after adjustments.
   - Since `zeroes` equals `m` and this is a crucial state for potentially determining the behavior of `func_1(left)` (assuming `func_1` might relate to counting zeroes or some similar operation), this relationship should be maintained.
   - The state of `result` being an empty list does not directly impact the loop condition but is part of the overall program state.
   - `mid` is defined but not directly used in the loop condition. However, its definition in relation to `low` and `high` might be relevant for understanding how `left` is positioned relative to the range `[low, high]`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop can execute again if `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Given the lack of information about `func_1`, the critical aspect is ensuring that `left` can still satisfy this condition after the previous iteration.
   - Since we're looking at the state after the previous iteration and need the loop to potentially execute again, we must consider how `left` (and by extension, `low` and `high`) might need to be positioned to satisfy the loop condition again.
   - However, without explicit information on how `func_1` behaves or how `left` is updated within the loop, we can only conclude based on the given states and the necessity for `func_1(left)` to equal `m` for the loop to continue.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is such that `func_1(left)` can potentially equal `m`**
