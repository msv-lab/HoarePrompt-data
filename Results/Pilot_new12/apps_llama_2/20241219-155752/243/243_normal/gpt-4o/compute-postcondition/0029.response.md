The value of `result` is updated to be a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Output State: **`left` is such that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `mid` is `5 * (m + 1) // 2`, `result` is a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` equals `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `5 * (m + 1) // 2 + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
