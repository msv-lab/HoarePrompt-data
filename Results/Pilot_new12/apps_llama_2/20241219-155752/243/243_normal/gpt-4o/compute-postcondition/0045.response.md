The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is `left - 1` such that `func_1(left - 1)` can potentially equal `m`.
