The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `m`, a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and returns a list of numbers `n` where the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 equals `m`. The returned list includes all numbers within a determined range where this condition is met, or an empty list if no such numbers exist. The function does not modify the input `m`. If a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, the function will find all consecutive numbers `n` that satisfy this condition within the determined range. The function handles edge cases where no numbers satisfy the condition, returning an empty list in such scenarios, and it is designed to efficiently search for the target numbers within a constrained range, ultimately returning a list of numbers that match the specified condition or an empty list if none are found. The upper limit of the search range is bounded by `5 * (m + 1)`, ensuring that the function remains efficient for large values of `m`.
