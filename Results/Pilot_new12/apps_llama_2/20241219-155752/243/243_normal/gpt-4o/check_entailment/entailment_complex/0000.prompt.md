You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Annotated Functions:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the pattern from the given output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times.
    #
    #1. **First Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
    #   - `count` becomes `count + n // 5`.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 25.
    #
    #2. **Second Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 25 (which is 5^2).
    #   - `count` becomes `count + n // 5 + n // 25`.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 125 (which is 5^3).
    #
    #3. **Third Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 125 (which is 5^3).
    #   - `count` is updated by adding `n // 125` to its previous value.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 625 (which is 5^4).
    #
    #**Pattern Observation**:
    #- The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the current `power_of_5`.
    #- `count` accumulates the integer division of `n` by powers of 5, starting from 5^1, 5^2, 5^3, and so on, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the respective power of 5.
    #- `power_of_5` is multiplied by 5 at each iteration, effectively increasing its power by 1.
    #
    #**Final Output State**:
    #- The loop will terminate when `n` is less than the current `power_of_5`. This means `power_of_5` will be the first power of 5 that exceeds `n`.
    #- `count` will accumulate the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 up to but not including the power of 5 that first exceeds `n`. This is essentially calculating the number of factors of 5 in all numbers up to `n`, considering the powers of 5.
    #- Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `count` starts at 0, once the loop terminates, `count` will hold the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, considering all powers of 5.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than `n`, `count` is the sum of `n // 5^k` for all `k` where `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `n`.**
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, which is the sum of `n // 5^k` for all `k` where `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. It does this by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 up to but not including the power of 5 that first exceeds `n`. This effectively counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (n factorial). The function does not modify the input `n` and handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 (in which case it returns 0) or when `n` is less than 5 (in which case it also returns 0), as well as any other non-negative integers. The function's output is a non-negative integer representing the total count of factors of 5 in the range from 1 to `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, and if a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, then `result` contains all such numbers `n` within the determined range; otherwise, `result` remains an empty list. The original value of `m` remains unchanged, and `high` will be less than or equal to the original `high` which is `5 * (m + 1)`.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of numbers `result` that contains all numbers `n` within the determined range where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, or an empty list if no such solution exists, with `m` being the original value and the determined range being between `low` and `high` where `low` is greater than `high` and `high` is less than or equal to `5 * (m + 1)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `m`, a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and returns a list of numbers `n` where the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 equals `m`. The returned list includes all numbers within a determined range where this condition is met, or an empty list if no such numbers exist. The function does not modify the input `m`. If a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, the function will find all consecutive numbers `n` that satisfy this condition within the determined range. The function handles edge cases where no numbers satisfy the condition, returning an empty list in such scenarios, and it is designed to efficiently search for the target numbers within a constrained range, ultimately returning a list of numbers that match the specified condition or an empty list if none are found. The upper limit of the search range is bounded by `5 * (m + 1)`, ensuring that the function remains efficient for large values of `m`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
