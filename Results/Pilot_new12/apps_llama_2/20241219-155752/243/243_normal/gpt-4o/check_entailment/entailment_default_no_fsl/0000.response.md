Correctness: **True**

The given Python program seems to accurately solve the problem of finding all positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! by summing the integer divisions of n by powers of 5. This approach is based on the fact that trailing zeroes in a factorial are caused by factors of 5 and 2, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of factors of 5 determines the number of trailing zeroes.

The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes. It starts with an initial range `[0, 5 * (m + 1)]` and then narrows down the range by repeatedly dividing it in half and checking if the middle number has more or fewer than m trailing zeroes. Once it finds a number with exactly m trailing zeroes, it expands its search to the left and right to find the entire range of numbers that satisfy this condition.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when no numbers satisfy the condition, and it returns an empty list in such scenarios. The examples provided also seem to work correctly, with the program returning the expected output for the given inputs.

Overall, based on the provided code and output hints, it seems that the program accurately solves the problem and handles all potential cases correctly.
