Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by using the fact that trailing zeroes in a factorial are caused by the multiplication of 2 and 5. Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of factors of 5.

2. The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the first number `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It then expands around this number to find all numbers `n` that satisfy this condition.

3. The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, when `m` is 1, the program correctly returns the numbers 5 to 9, because these are the numbers whose factorials end with exactly one trailing zero.

4. The program also handles cases where there are no numbers `n` whose factorial ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. For example, when `m` is 5, the program correctly returns an empty list, because there are no numbers `n` whose factorial ends with exactly five trailing zeroes.

Overall, the program is correct because it uses a sound mathematical approach to solve the problem and handles all edge cases correctly. It correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial and uses binary search to find all numbers `n` that satisfy the given condition.
