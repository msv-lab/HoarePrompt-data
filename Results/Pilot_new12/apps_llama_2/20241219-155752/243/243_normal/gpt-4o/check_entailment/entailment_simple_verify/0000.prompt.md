You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.

`func_1(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5 in `n!`. This is because a trailing zero in `n!` is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than factors of 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5.

`func_2(m)` uses binary search to find the range of numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It starts with a range `[low, high]` and repeatedly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the midpoint `mid` of the range using `func_1(mid)`. If the number of trailing zeroes is less than `m`, it moves the `low` end of the range to `mid + 1`. If the number of trailing zeroes is greater than `m`, it moves the `high` end of the range to `mid - 1`. If the number of trailing zeroes is equal to `m`, it finds the range of numbers `n` that satisfy this condition by moving to the left and right of `mid` until it finds numbers with more or fewer trailing zeroes.

The program correctly handles all potential cases because:

1. `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5.
2. `func_2(m)` uses binary search to efficiently find the range of numbers `n` that satisfy the condition.
3. The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `m` is 1 or when `m` is a large number.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the pattern from the given output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times.
    #
    #1. **First Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
    #   - `count` becomes `count + n // 5`.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 25.
    #
    #2. **Second Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 25 (which is 5^2).
    #   - `count` becomes `count + n // 5 + n // 25`.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 125 (which is 5^3).
    #
    #3. **Third Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 125 (which is 5^3).
    #   - `count` is updated by adding `n // 125` to its previous value.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 625 (which is 5^4).
    #
    #**Pattern Observation**:
    #- The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the current `power_of_5`.
    #- `count` accumulates the integer division of `n` by powers of 5, starting from 5^1, 5^2, 5^3, and so on, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the respective power of 5.
    #- `power_of_5` is multiplied by 5 at each iteration, effectively increasing its power by 1.
    #
    #**Final Output State**:
    #- The loop will terminate when `n` is less than the current `power_of_5`. This means `power_of_5` will be the first power of 5 that exceeds `n`.
    #- `count` will accumulate the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 up to but not including the power of 5 that first exceeds `n`. This is essentially calculating the number of factors of 5 in all numbers up to `n`, considering the powers of 5.
    #- Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `count` starts at 0, once the loop terminates, `count` will hold the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, considering all powers of 5.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than `n`, `count` is the sum of `n // 5^k` for all `k` where `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `n`.**
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, which is the sum of `n // 5^k` for all `k` where `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`.

    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1

                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, and if a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, then `result` contains all such numbers `n` within the determined range; otherwise, `result` remains an empty list. The original value of `m` remains unchanged, and `high` will be less than or equal to the original `high` which is `5 * (m + 1)`.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of numbers `result` that contains all numbers `n` within the determined range where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, or an empty list if no such solution exists, with `m` being the original value and the determined range being between `low` and `high` where `low` is greater than `high` and `high` is less than or equal to `5 * (m + 1)`
