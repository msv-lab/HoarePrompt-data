Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The main function `func_2` uses binary search to efficiently find the range of numbers `n` for which `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It utilizes the helper function `func_1` to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`, which is done by summing the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5.

The code annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic behind both functions and how they work together to solve the problem. The annotations also describe the state of the program before and after each function call, providing insight into the algorithms used.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when no numbers satisfy the condition, returning an empty list in such scenarios. It also efficiently searches for the target numbers within a constrained range, ultimately returning a list of numbers that match the specified condition.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For instance, when the input is `1`, the program correctly outputs `5` followed by the numbers `5 6 7 8 9`, which are the numbers `n` for which `n!` ends with exactly `1` trailing zero. Similarly, when the input is `5`, the program correctly outputs `0`, indicating that there are no numbers `n` for which `n!` ends with exactly `5` trailing zeroes.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The use of binary search and the helper function `func_1` makes the program efficient and accurate in finding the desired numbers.
