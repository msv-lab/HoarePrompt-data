You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the pattern from the given output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times.
    #
    #1. **First Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
    #   - `count` becomes `count + n // 5`.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 25.
    #
    #2. **Second Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 25 (which is 5^2).
    #   - `count` becomes `count + n // 5 + n // 25`.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 125 (which is 5^3).
    #
    #3. **Third Execution**: 
    #   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 125 (which is 5^3).
    #   - `count` is updated by adding `n // 125` to its previous value.
    #   - `power_of_5` becomes 625 (which is 5^4).
    #
    #**Pattern Observation**:
    #- The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the current `power_of_5`.
    #- `count` accumulates the integer division of `n` by powers of 5, starting from 5^1, 5^2, 5^3, and so on, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the respective power of 5.
    #- `power_of_5` is multiplied by 5 at each iteration, effectively increasing its power by 1.
    #
    #**Final Output State**:
    #- The loop will terminate when `n` is less than the current `power_of_5`. This means `power_of_5` will be the first power of 5 that exceeds `n`.
    #- `count` will accumulate the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 up to but not including the power of 5 that first exceeds `n`. This is essentially calculating the number of factors of 5 in all numbers up to `n`, considering the powers of 5.
    #- Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `count` starts at 0, once the loop terminates, `count` will hold the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, considering all powers of 5.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than `n`, `count` is the sum of `n // 5^k` for all `k` where `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `n`.**
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, which is the sum of `n // 5^k` for all `k` where `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 100000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, and if a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, then `result` contains all such numbers `n` within the determined range; otherwise, `result` remains an empty list. The original value of `m` remains unchanged, and `high` will be less than or equal to the original `high` which is `5 * (m + 1)`.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of numbers `result` that contains all numbers `n` within the determined range where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, or an empty list if no such solution exists, with `m` being the original value and the determined range being between `low` and `high` where `low` is greater than `high` and `high` is less than or equal to `5 * (m + 1)`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
