To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its logic and behavior based on the provided problem description. The task is to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes, where `m` is a given integer.

### Program Logic Analysis

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n`. The logic is based on the fact that trailing zeroes in `n!` are created by the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in `n!`, the number of factors of 5 determines the number of trailing zeroes. The function accurately counts the factors of 5 in all numbers up to `n` by dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing up the results.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**: Given `m`, this function finds all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It uses a binary search approach to narrow down the range of possible `n` values and then checks each `n` in the determined range to see if `n!` has `m` trailing zeroes. The binary search starts with a range from 0 to `5 * (m + 1)`, which is a reasonable upper bound because the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` grows as `n` increases, and for any `n`, the number of trailing zeroes is less than or equal to `n/5 + n/25 + n/125 +...`, which is less than `n`. Once it finds an `n` where `n!` has `m` trailing zeroes, it expands the search around this `n` to find all `n` that satisfy the condition.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program assumes that the input will be a valid positive integer `m`. Given this assumption, it correctly handles the calculation of trailing zeroes for any valid input `m`.

- **Logic for Finding `n`**: The binary search approach in `func_2` efficiently finds an initial `n` for which `n!` has `m` trailing zeroes, if such an `n` exists. The subsequent expansion around this `n` to find all relevant `n` values ensures that no solutions are missed.

- **Accuracy of `func_1`**: The method used in `func_1` to count factors of 5 is accurate and complies with the mathematical principle that the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 occurs as a factor in all the numbers from 1 to `n`.

- **Compliance with Problem Description**: The program follows the problem description by first finding all `n` values for a given `m` and then printing the count of these `n` values followed by the `n` values themselves. If no such `n` exists, it prints 0.

### Conclusion

The provided Python program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of any given number and uses this to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes for a given `m`. Given the assumptions about valid input, the program does what the problem description asks for in every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
