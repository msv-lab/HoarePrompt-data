You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Functions with output description for each function:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function calculates and returns the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. It does this by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 up to but not including the power of 5 that first exceeds `n`. This effectively counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (n factorial). The function does not modify the input `n` and handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 (in which case it returns 0) or when `n` is less than 5 (in which case it also returns 0), as well as any other non-negative integers. The function's output is a non-negative integer representing the total count of factors of 5 in the range from 1 to `n`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `m`, a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and returns a list of numbers `n` where the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 5 equals `m`. The returned list includes all numbers within a determined range where this condition is met, or an empty list if no such numbers exist. The function does not modify the input `m`. If a solution exists where `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... == m`, the function will find all consecutive numbers `n` that satisfy this condition within the determined range. The function handles edge cases where no numbers satisfy the condition, returning an empty list in such scenarios, and it is designed to efficiently search for the target numbers within a constrained range, ultimately returning a list of numbers that match the specified condition or an empty list if none are found. The upper limit of the search range is bounded by `5 * (m + 1)`, ensuring that the function remains efficient for large values of `m`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
