Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (n factorial) by counting the factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`. `func_2` uses `func_1` to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

The output hints for both functions agree with the code and help to understand how the functions work. The first function correctly counts the trailing zeroes in `n!`, and the second function efficiently searches for the target numbers within a constrained range.

The code handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 0 or when no numbers satisfy the condition, and it is designed to efficiently search for the target numbers. The upper limit of the search range is bounded by `5 * (m + 1)`, ensuring that the function remains efficient for large values of `m`.

The provided examples also suggest that the code works correctly. For instance, when `m` is 1, the output should be the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which are indeed the numbers whose factorials end with exactly one trailing zero. When `m` is 5, there are no numbers whose factorials end with exactly five trailing zeros, so the output is 0.

In conclusion, the code seems to correctly solve the problem and handle all potential cases, so the correctness is **True**.
