Correctness: **True**.

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.

`func_1(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5 in `n!`. This is because a trailing zero in `n!` is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than factors of 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5.

`func_2(m)` uses binary search to find the range of numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It starts with a range `[low, high]` and repeatedly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the midpoint `mid` of the range using `func_1(mid)`. If the number of trailing zeroes is less than `m`, it moves the `low` end of the range to `mid + 1`. If the number of trailing zeroes is greater than `m`, it moves the `high` end of the range to `mid - 1`. If the number of trailing zeroes is equal to `m`, it finds the range of numbers `n` that satisfy this condition by moving to the left and right of `mid` until it finds numbers with more or fewer trailing zeroes.

The program correctly handles all potential cases because:

1. `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the number of factors of 5.
2. `func_2(m)` uses binary search to efficiently find the range of numbers `n` that satisfy the condition.
3. The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `m` is 1 or when `m` is a large number.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
