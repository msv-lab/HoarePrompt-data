The function calculates and returns the total count of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. It does this by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 up to but not including the power of 5 that first exceeds `n`. This effectively counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (n factorial). The function does not modify the input `n` and handles edge cases such as when `n` is 0 (in which case it returns 0) or when `n` is less than 5 (in which case it also returns 0), as well as any other non-negative integers. The function's output is a non-negative integer representing the total count of factors of 5 in the range from 1 to `n`.
