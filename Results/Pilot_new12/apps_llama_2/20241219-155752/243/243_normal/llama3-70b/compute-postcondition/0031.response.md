The `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only exits the most internal loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `m`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the value 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
