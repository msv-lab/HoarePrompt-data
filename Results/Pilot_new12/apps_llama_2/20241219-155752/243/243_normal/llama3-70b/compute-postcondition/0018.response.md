The code `ans = []` initializes an empty list and assigns it to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `n`, or `count`. 

The value of `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + n > 100`. Since `n` is 1, `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, which means `5*m > 99`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the original input integer, `n` is 1, `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, and `ans` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 1, `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, and `ans` is an empty list**
