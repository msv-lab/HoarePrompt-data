To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code's impact on it.

The initial state indicates:
- `m` is the original input integer.
- `n` is 1.
- `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`. This implies `count` is calculated based on `m`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- There's a conditional statement that if `n`/(5^`count`) is less than `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given the code snippet `ans.append(n)`, this line of code adds the current value of `n` to the list `ans`.

Since `n` is 1, after executing `ans.append(n)`, the list `ans` will now contain the value 1.

The states of `m`, `n`, and `count` do not change due to this operation. The condition regarding the loop or if statement doesn't affect the values of the variables but determines the flow of the program. However, the specific operation of appending `n` to `ans` doesn't inherently change `n` or trigger the conditional break based on the given snippet alone.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the original input integer, `n` is 1, `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, and if `n`/(5^`count`) is less than `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 1, `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, and if `n`/(5^`count`) is less than `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
