To find the output state, let's first determine the values of `m`, `count`, and `n` based on the given conditions.

1. `m` is the original input integer.
2. `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`. This means `5*m > 99`, so `m > 19.8`. Therefore, the smallest integer `m` that satisfies this condition is `20`, making `count` equal to `20` since `m` itself is the input integer and `count` seems to be directly derived from the condition related to `m`.
3. `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5 > m`. Given that `m` is `20`, `n // 5` must be greater than `20`, meaning `n` must be greater than `100`. The smallest integer `n` that satisfies this is `101`.

However, the code snippet provided is `print(len(ans))`, which indicates it's printing the length of a list or sequence `ans`. Since `ans` is not defined in the initial state or modified by the given code snippet, we have to assume that `ans` is defined elsewhere in the code not shown here.

Given the information we have, the initial state conditions, and the fact that the code simply prints the length of `ans` without modifying `m`, `count`, or `n`, the output state regarding `m`, `count`, and `n` remains unchanged. The code's execution does not alter the values of `m`, `count`, or `n` based on the provided initial state. 

The value of `ans` and its length are not specified in the initial conditions, so we can't provide a specific value for `len(ans)`. However, we can state that the print statement will output the length of `ans`, whatever that may be.

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `count` equals `m` which is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5 > m`, and the length of `ans` has been printed as output, with its actual value dependent on the definition of `ans` not provided in the initial state.**
