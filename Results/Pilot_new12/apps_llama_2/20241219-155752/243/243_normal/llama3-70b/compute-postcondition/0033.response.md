To solve this problem, we first need to evaluate the condition `n // 5 < m`. Given that `n` is 3 and `m` is the original input integer, we can simplify this to `3 // 5 < m`, which further simplifies to `0 < m` because `3 // 5` equals 0. This condition implies that `m` must be greater than 0 for the code within the if statement to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is the original input integer.
- `n` is 3.
- `ans` is a list containing the value 2.

The code `ans.append(n)` will execute if the condition `0 < m` is true. Since `n` is 3, this means that the value 3 will be appended to the list `ans` if `m` is greater than 0.

Therefore, if `m` is greater than 0, `ans` will become a list containing the values 2 and 3. If `m` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged as a list containing only the value 2.

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 3, if `m` is greater than 0 then `ans` is a list containing the values 2 and 3, else `ans` is a list containing the value 2.**
