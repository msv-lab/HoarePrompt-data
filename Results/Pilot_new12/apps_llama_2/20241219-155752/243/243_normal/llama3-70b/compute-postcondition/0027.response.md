Postcondition: ***`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 2, if `n // 5 ** count` is less than `m`, then `count` is 20, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `ans` being a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as defined in the precondition, with `count` being the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, and `ans` being a list containing the value 1.***
