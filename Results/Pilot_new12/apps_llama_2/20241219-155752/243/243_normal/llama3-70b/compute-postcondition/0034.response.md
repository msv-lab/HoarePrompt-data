The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is 3, so the new value of `n` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the original input integer, `n` is 4, if `m` is greater than 0 then `ans` is a list containing the values 2 and 3, else `ans` is a list containing the value 2.
Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 4, if `m` is greater than 0 then `ans` is [2, 3], else `ans` is [2]**
