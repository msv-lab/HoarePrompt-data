The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 2, so the new value of `count` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The condition if `n // 5` is still pending as `n` is 1, so it is still `n // 5 = 0`, which is less than 1 and hence `n` is still less than 5. `m` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) and its value is the input integer.
Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) and its value is the input integer, `count` is 3, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is still less than 1, as `n` is 1.**
