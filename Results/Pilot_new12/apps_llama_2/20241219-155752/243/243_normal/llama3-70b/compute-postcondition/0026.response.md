To find the value of `count`, we first need to solve the inequality `5*m + 1 > 100`. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives `5*m > 99`. Dividing both sides by 5 gives `m > 19.8`. Since `m` is an integer, the smallest value of `m` that satisfies this inequality is 20. 

However, we are given that `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, which means `count` is not directly equal to `m` but rather is determined based on the condition related to `m`. The condition itself defines a threshold for `m`, but `count` is a separate variable that takes the smallest integer value satisfying the given condition related to `m`. 

Given the inequality, for `m = 20`, `5*m + 1 = 5*20 + 1 = 101`, which indeed is greater than 100. Thus, `count` would be the smallest integer `m` that makes `5*m + 1 > 100` true, which we've established would be 20, considering the context provided.

However, since the task involves a `break` statement, which doesn't alter the values of variables but exits the loop or conditional statement it's directly inside of, the values of `m`, `n`, `count`, and `ans` are not changed by the `break` statement itself.

Therefore, considering the `break` statement does not change variable values but we've established the context for `count` based on `m`:

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 2, `count` is 20, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
