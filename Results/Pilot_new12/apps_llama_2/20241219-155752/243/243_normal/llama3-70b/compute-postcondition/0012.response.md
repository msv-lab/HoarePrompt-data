According to the code, the `while` loop statement is `while True`, which means the loop will always execute again regardless of the current state. Since there are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to continue, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) and its value is the input integer, `count` is 2, `n` is 1**
