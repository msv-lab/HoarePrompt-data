To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `m` is the original input integer, `n` is 2, if `n // 5` (this condition seems incomplete, but we will assume it's a part of a larger conditional statement that doesn't affect the initial values of `m` and `n` directly). `ans` is a list that is being appended with the value of `n`.

Given Code:
```python
ans.append(n)
```

This code appends the value of `n` (which is 2) to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value 2**. 

Note: Since `n // 5` seems like an incomplete condition and doesn't directly influence the values of `m`, `n`, or the operation on `ans` as provided, we focus on the direct outcome of the given code snippet. If there's additional context or a complete condition, it might alter how we interpret the state of `n` or other variables, but based on the information given, `n` remains 2, and `ans` is updated to include this value.
