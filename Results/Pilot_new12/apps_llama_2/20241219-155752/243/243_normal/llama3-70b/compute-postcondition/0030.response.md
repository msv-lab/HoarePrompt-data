To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the current state of the program.

The `while` loop statement is `while True:`, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement or an exception that stops its execution. Since the condition is always `True`, the loop does not depend on any variable conditions to proceed to the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is the original input integer,
- `n` is 3,
- `ans` is a list containing the value 2.

Because the loop condition is `while True`, it will always execute the next iteration regardless of the values of `m`, `n`, or `ans`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the current state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is the original input integer, `n` is 3, `ans` is a list containing the value 2**
