Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is trying to solve the problem of finding the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. However, the program does not work correctly for all cases.

One potential case that the program does not handle correctly is when the input m is a large number. The program uses a while loop to increment the count until n // 5 ** count >= m. However, this loop may not terminate for large values of m, because the value of n // 5 ** count may never be greater than or equal to m.

Another issue with the program is that it uses a second while loop to find the values of n that satisfy the condition n // 5 ** count >= m. However, this loop starts from n = 1, which means it will include values of n that are less than the actual values that satisfy the condition. The loop should start from a value of n that is closer to the actual values that satisfy the condition.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use the fact that the number of trailing zeroes in n! is equal to the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of n!. This can be calculated using the formula: 

number of trailing zeroes = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) +...

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    ans = []
    n = 5 * m
    while True:
        num_zeros = 0
        i = 5
        j = n
        while j // i >= 1:
            num_zeros += j // i
            i *= 5
        if num_zeros == m:
            ans.append(n)
            count += 1
        elif num_zeros > m:
            break
        n += 1
    print(count)
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
```

This program calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! for each value of n, and checks if it is equal to m. If it is, the value of n is added to the list of answers. The program stops when the number of trailing zeroes exceeds m.
