Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not accurately solve the problem for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program counts the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number. 

The program uses `n // 5 ** count` to determine the number of trailing zeroes, but this approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the number of trailing zeroes by counting the number of factors of 5 in the factorial, not by using the exponentiation operator `**`.

Here's a specific case where the program does not work correctly: 

For the input `3`, the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2 10 11`. This is because `10!` and `11!` both end with exactly `3` zeroes (i.e., `3628800` and `39916800`, respectively).

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each number `n` and check if it equals the given number `m`. 

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = 0
        temp = n
        while temp >= 5:
            count += temp // 5
            temp //= 5
        if count == m:
            ans.append(n)
        elif count > m:
            break
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
```
