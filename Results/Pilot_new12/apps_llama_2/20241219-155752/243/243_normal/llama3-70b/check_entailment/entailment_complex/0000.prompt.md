You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is an integer m, such that 1 <= m <= 100000.
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is the original input integer, `n` is 1, and `count` is the smallest integer such that `5
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        
        ans.append(n)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is the original input integer, `count` is the smallest integer such that `5*m + 1 > 100`, `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer input from the user, calculates the smallest integer count such that 5^count is greater than or equal to the input integer m, generates a list of integers n that when divided by 5^count are greater than or equal to m, and prints the length of this list and the list itself. The function does not return any value and only prints the results. The function assumes that the input integer m is between 1 and 100000, but does not perform any error checking to ensure this. If the input is outside this range, the function may not behave as expected. The function also does not handle any exceptions that may occur during the input or calculation process.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
