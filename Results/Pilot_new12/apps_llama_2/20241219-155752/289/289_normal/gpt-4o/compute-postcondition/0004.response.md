Functionality: **The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the maximum number of games required for a tournament with `n` players, and prints the result. The input `n` is expected to be an integer between 2 and 10^18. The function returns no value (i.e., `None`), but prints the calculated maximum number of games, which is one less than the bit length of `n`. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer input or input outside the specified range, which may result in errors or unexpected behavior. After execution, the program's state is that it has printed the calculated maximum number of games to the console and terminated, with no changes to the input or any external state.**
