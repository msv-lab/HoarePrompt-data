The code prints the value of `max_games`. The value of `max_games` is one less than the bit length of `n`, thus `max_games` = `n`.bit_length() - 1, ranging from 1 to 60. The state of `n` is not affected. The value of `max_games` is printed, but its value remains the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is one less than the bit length of `n`, thus `max_games` = `n`.bit_length() - 1, ranging from 1 to 60,  and the value of `max_games` has been printed**
