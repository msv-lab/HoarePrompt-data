The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but based on the problem description, it can be assumed that the input is a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). The function's return value is not explicitly stated in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and return a value based on the input.


However, since the actual output or return value of the function is not provided, the exact functionality description is incomplete. For a complete description, the return value or the output cases (if any) should be considered.


Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, but the return value is not specified.**
