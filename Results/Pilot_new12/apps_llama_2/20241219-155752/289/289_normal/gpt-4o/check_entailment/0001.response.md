Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct. Here's an explanation of why it works:

The program uses the `bit_length` method of Python integers, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number in binary. For example, the number 10 (which is 1010 in binary) has a `bit_length` of 4.

The reason this works is that the number of games a player can play in a knockout tournament with the given rule is equivalent to the number of times we can subtract the largest possible power of 2 from `n` before we reach 0.

When `n` is a power of 2, the maximum number of games is simply `bit_length(n) - 1`, because the player can play against each of the other players in a binary tree structure, where each game eliminates half of the remaining players.

When `n` is not a power of 2, the maximum number of games is still `bit_length(n) - 1`, because the player can play against each of the other players in a similar binary tree structure, but with some players eliminated in earlier rounds.

For example, if `n` is 10, the `bit_length` is 4, and the maximum number of games is `4 - 1 = 3`. However, the player can only play 4 games if there are 8 or more players (a power of 2), but since there are only 10 players, the player can only play against 3 other players (for example, player 1 can play against players 2, 3, and then the winner of the game between players 4 and 5, and the winner of the game between players 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), so the result is correct.

The code passes all the test cases provided, and there is no obvious case where it would fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
