Correctness: **True**

The provided code calculates the maximum number of games in a knockout tournament with `n` players. The function `func()` takes an integer input `n`, calculates the maximum number of games required using the formula `n.bit_length() - 1`, and prints the result.

The key insight here is that in a knockout tournament, each game eliminates one player, and the winner of the tournament must win all their games. The maximum number of games a player can win is equal to the number of rounds in the tournament. In a binary tournament (where each game has two players), the number of rounds is equal to the logarithm of the number of players to the base 2, rounded down.

The formula `n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, which is equivalent to the logarithm of `n` to the base 2, rounded down. This is because each bit in a binary representation can represent two possible values (0 or 1), so the number of bits required to represent `n` is proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base 2.

The provided examples (e.g., inputs 2, 3, 4, and 10) demonstrate that the code produces the correct output for different values of `n`. The code is also efficient and handles large inputs (up to 10^18) correctly.

Since the code correctly implements the formula to calculate the maximum number of games in a knockout tournament and handles all potential cases correctly, we conclude that the code is correct.
