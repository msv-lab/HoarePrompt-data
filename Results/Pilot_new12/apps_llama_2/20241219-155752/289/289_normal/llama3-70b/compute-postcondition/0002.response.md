The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept an integer `n`, where `n` represents the number of players and is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.


Since the output is not specified, it's impossible to determine the return value of the function.


However, assuming the function is supposed to accept the integer `n` as described in the constraints, the corrected description would be:


The function `func` should accept a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. 
Functionality: **The function should accept an integer n, where n is the number of players and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, but the return value is not specified.**
