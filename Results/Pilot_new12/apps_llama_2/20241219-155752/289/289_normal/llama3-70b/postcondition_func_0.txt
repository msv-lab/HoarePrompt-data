The function accepts an integer `n` as input from the user, where `n` is expected to represent the number of players and is expected to be within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. It calculates and prints the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary minus one, effectively logging the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`. The function does not explicitly validate if the input is within the specified range or handle cases where the input may not be a valid integer. After execution, the program state concludes with the output of the calculated bit length minus one, without returning any value or altering the external state directly.
