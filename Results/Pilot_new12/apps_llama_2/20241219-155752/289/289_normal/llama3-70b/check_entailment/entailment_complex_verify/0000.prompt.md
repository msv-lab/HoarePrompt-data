You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program works by finding the bit length of the input number `n` and subtracting 1. This approach is based on the observation that the maximum number of games the winner can play is equal to the number of rounds in a binary tree with `n` leaves.

In a knockout tournament, each game eliminates one player, and the winner moves on to the next round. Since the tournament follows knockout rules from the very first game, each round reduces the number of players by roughly half. This is analogous to a binary tree, where each internal node represents a game, and the leaves represent the players.

The bit length of a number `n` represents the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. For a number `n` with bit length `k`, we know that `2^(k-1) <= n < 2^k`. Therefore, the number of rounds required to eliminate all players is `k-1`, which is equivalent to the bit length of `n` minus 1.

The program correctly implements this idea, and it works for all potential cases. The provided examples illustrate this, and there are no obvious edge cases where the program would fail. Therefore, the program is correct.

In more detail, the mathematical explanation is as follows:

- The number of players `n` is a power of 2, `n = 2^k`. In this case, the tournament is a perfect binary tree, and the winner plays `k-1` games.
- The number of players `n` is not a power of 2, `2^(k-1) <= n < 2^k`. In this case, the tournament is not a perfect binary tree, but the winner still plays at most `k-1` games.

In both cases, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `k-1`, which is equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1. The program correctly implements this idea and works for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a single integer n, where n is the number of players and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` as input from the user, where `n` is expected to represent the number of players and is expected to be within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. It calculates and prints the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary minus one, effectively logging the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`. The function does not explicitly validate if the input is within the specified range or handle cases where the input may not be a valid integer. After execution, the program state concludes with the output of the calculated bit length minus one, without returning any value or altering the external state directly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
