#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a single integer n, where n is the number of players and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` as input from the user, where `n` is expected to represent the number of players and is expected to be within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. It calculates and prints the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary minus one, effectively logging the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`. The function does not explicitly validate if the input is within the specified range or handle cases where the input may not be a valid integer. After execution, the program state concludes with the output of the calculated bit length minus one, without returning any value or altering the external state directly.
