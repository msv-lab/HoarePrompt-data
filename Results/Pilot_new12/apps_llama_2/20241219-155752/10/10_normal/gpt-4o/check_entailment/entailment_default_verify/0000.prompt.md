You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to solve the problem by comparing each sofa's coordinates with every other sofa's coordinates to count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the current sofa. However, the logic for counting the sofas is incorrect.

The conditions for counting a sofa to the left, right, top, or bottom of the current sofa are not properly implemented. Specifically, the conditions `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j` and `if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j` are not sufficient to determine if a sofa is to the left or right of the current sofa. 

Similarly, the conditions `if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j` and `if y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` are not sufficient to determine if a sofa is to the top or bottom of the current sofa. 

To correctly count the sofas, we need to consider all the cells covered by each sofa and compare them with the cells covered by the current sofa.

For example, consider a case where there are two sofas with coordinates (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2) respectively. The current program would incorrectly count the second sofa as not being to the right of the first sofa.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to correctly compare the cells covered by each sofa. We can do this by iterating over all the cells covered by each sofa and comparing them with the cells covered by the current sofa.

Here's an example of how we can modify the program to correctly count the sofas:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        cells = set([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)])
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            cells_j = set([(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)])
            if all(x < x1_j for x, _ in cells) or all(x < x2_j for x, _ in cells):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if all(x > x1_j for x, _ in cells) or all(x > x2_j for x, _ in cells):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if all(y < y1_j for _, y in cells) or all(y < y2_j for _, y in cells):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if all(y > y1_j for _, y in cells) or all(y > y2_j for _, y in cells):
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)

```

This modified program correctly counts the sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. However, even this modified program may not cover all the edge cases and may not be entirely correct. 

To ensure the correctness of the program, we need to thoroughly test it with different inputs and edge cases. 

In any case, the original program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes input related to dimensions, sofa coordinates, and counts, and returns the index of the sofa that matches the given counts of sofas to its left, right, top, and bottom, or -1 if no match is found. The function takes no parameters, reads input from the user, and returns an integer representing the index of the matching sofa. The input is expected to be well-formed and follows a specific format. The function handles edge cases where no matching sofa is found, and it does not perform any error checking on the input. The function's output will be either the index of a matching sofa (1-indexed) or -1, indicating that no sofa matches the given counts.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
