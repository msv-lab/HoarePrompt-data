Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. The problem statement specifies that sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. However, the code checks if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j to count the number of sofas to the right, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would be to check if there exists a cell covered by sofa A that is to the left of a cell covered by sofa B. Similarly, the code should check if there exists a cell covered by sofa A that is to the right of a cell covered by sofa B, and so on.

For example, consider the case where d = 2, n = 2, m = 2, and the sofa coordinates are (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2). The counts should be (0, 1, 0, 0) for the first sofa and (1, 0, 0, 0) for the second sofa. However, the code will not produce the correct counts for this case.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if min(x1, x2) < min(x1_j, x2_j) and max(x1, x2) < max(x1_j, x2_j):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if min(x1, x2) > min(x1_j, x2_j) and max(x1, x2) > max(x1_j, x2_j):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if min(y1, y2) < min(y1_j, y2_j) and max(y1, y2) < max(y1_j, y2_j):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if min(y1, y2) > min(y1_j, y2_j) and max(y1, y2) > max(y1_j, y2_j):
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and top_count[i] == cnt_t and bottom_count[i] == cnt_b:
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)

```

Note: The code still doesn't completely solve the problem because it checks if the entire sofa is to the left/right/top/bottom of another sofa, not just if there exist cells covered by the two sofas that satisfy the condition. The correct code would need to iterate over all cells covered by each sofa and check if there exist cells covered by other sofas that satisfy the condition.

Here is a more complete solution:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        cells = []
        if x1 == x2:
            for y in range(min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2) + 1):
                cells.append((x1, y))
        else:
            for x in range(min(x1, x2), max(x1, x2) + 1):
                cells.append((x, y1))
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            cells_j = []
            if x1_j == x2_j:
                for y in range(min(y1_j, y2_j), max(y1_j, y2_j) + 1):
                    cells_j.append((x1_j, y))
            else:
                for x in range(min(x1_j, x2_j), max(x1_j, x2_j) + 1):
                    cells_j.append((x, y1_j))
            to_left = False
            to_right = False
            to_top = False
            to_bottom = False
            for cell in cells:
                for cell_j in cells_j:
                    if cell[0] < cell_j[0]:
                        to_left = True
                    if cell[0] > cell_j[0]:
                        to_right = True
                    if cell[1] < cell_j[1]:
                        to_top = True
                    if cell[1] > cell_j[1]:
                        to_bottom = True
            if to_left:
                left_count[j] += 1
            if to_right:
                right_count[j] += 1
            if to_top:
                top_count[j] += 1
            if to_bottom:
                bottom_count[j] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and top_count[i] == cnt_t and bottom_count[i] == cnt_b:
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)

```

This code correctly checks if there exist cells covered by two sofas that satisfy the condition. However, it's still not a complete solution because it counts the number of sofas that are to the left/right/top/bottom of each sofa, not the number of sofas that are to the left/right/top/bottom of each sofa and not equal to it. To fix this, the code should only increment the counts if the two sofas are not equal.

Also, this code has a time complexity of O(d^2 * m * n) which is not efficient for large inputs. The code can be optimized by using a different data structure to store the cells covered by each sofa, such as a set or a dictionary, which would allow for faster lookups and comparisons.
