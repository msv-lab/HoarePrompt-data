Correctness: **False** 

The provided program is incorrect. It does not handle the cases where two cells of a sofa are on the same row or column correctly. 

For example, if we have two sofas with coordinates (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2), the program will not correctly count the number of sofas to the left and right of each sofa. This is because it does not correctly handle the case where two cells of a sofa are on the same column.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to correctly handle the cases where two cells of a sofa are on the same row or column. 

Here is an example of how we can modify the program:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        min_x = min(x1, x2)
        max_x = max(x1, x2)
        min_y = min(y1, y2)
        max_y = max(y1, y2)
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            min_x_j = min(x1_j, x2_j)
            max_x_j = max(x1_j, x2_j)
            min_y_j = min(y1_j, y2_j)
            max_y_j = max(y1_j, y2_j)
            if min_x_j > max_x:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if max_x_j < min_x:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if min_y_j > max_y:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if max_y_j < min_y:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```
