Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to solve the problem by comparing each sofa's coordinates with every other sofa's coordinates to count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the current sofa. However, the logic for counting the sofas is incorrect.

The conditions for counting a sofa to the left, right, top, or bottom of the current sofa are not properly implemented. Specifically, the conditions `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j` and `if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j` are not sufficient to determine if a sofa is to the left or right of the current sofa. 

Similarly, the conditions `if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j` and `if y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j` are not sufficient to determine if a sofa is to the top or bottom of the current sofa. 

To correctly count the sofas, we need to consider all the cells covered by each sofa and compare them with the cells covered by the current sofa.

For example, consider a case where there are two sofas with coordinates (1, 1, 1, 2) and (2, 1, 2, 2) respectively. The current program would incorrectly count the second sofa as not being to the right of the first sofa.

To fix this, we need to modify the program to correctly compare the cells covered by each sofa. We can do this by iterating over all the cells covered by each sofa and comparing them with the cells covered by the current sofa.

Here's an example of how we can modify the program to correctly count the sofas:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        cells = set([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)])
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            cells_j = set([(x1_j, y1_j), (x2_j, y2_j)])
            if all(x < x1_j for x, _ in cells) or all(x < x2_j for x, _ in cells):
                right_count[i] += 1
            if all(x > x1_j for x, _ in cells) or all(x > x2_j for x, _ in cells):
                left_count[i] += 1
            if all(y < y1_j for _, y in cells) or all(y < y2_j for _, y in cells):
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if all(y > y1_j for _, y in cells) or all(y > y2_j for _, y in cells):
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)

```

This modified program correctly counts the sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. However, even this modified program may not cover all the edge cases and may not be entirely correct. 

To ensure the correctness of the program, we need to thoroughly test it with different inputs and edge cases. 

In any case, the original program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.
