The function processes input related to dimensions, sofa coordinates, and counts, and returns the index of the sofa that matches the given counts of sofas to its left, right, top, and bottom, or -1 if no match is found. The function takes no parameters, reads input from the user, and returns an integer representing the index of the matching sofa. The input is expected to be well-formed and follows a specific format. The function handles edge cases where no matching sofa is found, and it does not perform any error checking on the input. The function's output will be either the index of a matching sofa (1-indexed) or -1, indicating that no sofa matches the given counts.
