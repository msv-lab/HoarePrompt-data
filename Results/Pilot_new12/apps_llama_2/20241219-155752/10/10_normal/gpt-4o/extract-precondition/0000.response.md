Precondition: **The input is well-formed and follows the given format: the first line contains an integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), the second line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), the next d lines contain four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) representing coordinates of sofas, and the last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).**
