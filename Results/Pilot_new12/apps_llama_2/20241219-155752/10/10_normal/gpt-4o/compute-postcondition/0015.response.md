The code initializes a new list `right_count` with `d` zeros. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, where each tuple represents four input integers, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, where each tuple represents four input integers, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros**
