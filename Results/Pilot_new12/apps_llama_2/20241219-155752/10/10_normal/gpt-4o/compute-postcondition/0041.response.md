The code increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count` is a list where the element at index `i` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count` are lists, the tuple at index `j` in `sofas` has elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the tuple at index `j` in `sofas`.**
