Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and if `i` equals `j`, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged since there is no else part to handle the alternative condition***
