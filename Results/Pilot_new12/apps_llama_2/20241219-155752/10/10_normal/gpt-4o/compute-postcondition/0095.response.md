Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the third tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the third tuple in `sofas`. If `i` equals `j`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, with `i` equals 0 and `j` equals 2. Since `i` equals 0 and `j` equals 2, `i` will never equal `j`, and thus, no change will occur***
