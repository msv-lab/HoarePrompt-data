The value of `target_sofa` is updated to `i + 1`. Given that `i` equals 1, `target_sofa` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, `i` equals 1, `target_sofa` equals 2, and the condition `if left_count[i] equals cnt_l, right_count[i] equals cnt_r, top_count[i] equals cnt_t, and bottom_count[i] equals cnt_b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, `i` equals 1, `target_sofa` equals 2**
