Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` contain the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa, respectively, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the first tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the first tuple in `sofas`. The current value of `x1` is less than `x1_j` and the current value of `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
