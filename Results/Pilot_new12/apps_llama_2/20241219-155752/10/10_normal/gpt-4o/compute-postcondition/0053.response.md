The given code increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is conceptually in its next position if `i` equals `j`, `x1_j` is the first element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `y1_j` is the second element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `x2_j` is the third element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1**
