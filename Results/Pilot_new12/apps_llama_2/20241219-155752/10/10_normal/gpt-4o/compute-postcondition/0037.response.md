To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the information given and the structure of the for loop.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
And the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `n` and `m` are integers,
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples,
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers,
- `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists with specific conditions based on the elements of `sofas` and comparisons between them,
- `i` equals `j`, indicating that `i` and `j` are used interchangeably in the context,
- Conditions for updating `bottom_count` and `top_count` are based on comparisons between `y1`, `y2`, and `y2_j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `d`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` (or `i`) has reached a certain value. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `j` equals `i` and at the end of the last iteration, `i` equals `j`, we can infer that `i` (or `j`) is currently at some index less than `d` since the loop hasn't terminated. For the next iteration to occur, `j` (or `i`) must be incremented to the next index.

Considering the constraints and the structure of the loop, the adjustments needed for the state to reflect the start of the next iteration are:
- `j` (or `i`) needs to be incremented by 1, so it points to the next index in the range of `d`.
- The conditions for `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` might need updates based on the new value of `j` (or `i`), as these lists' values depend on the comparisons involving elements of `sofas` at index `j`.

However, without explicit details on how `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, and the specific updates to `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are affected by the loop iteration, we focus on the increment of `j` (or `i`) and the implications for `sofas` and related lists.

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list that may need updating based on new `j`, `top_count` is a list that may need updating based on new `j`, `right_count` is a list that may need updating based on new `j`, `bottom_count` is a list that may need updating based on new `j` and comparisons with `y1`, `y2`, and `y2_j`, the first tuple in `sofas` has elements `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and for a given index `j`, the tuple at index `j` in `sofas` has elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `i` (or `j`) is incremented to the next index**
