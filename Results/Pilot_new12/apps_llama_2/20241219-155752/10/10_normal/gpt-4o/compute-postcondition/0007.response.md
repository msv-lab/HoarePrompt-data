The code is reading four integers from the input and assigning them to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The initial state has `sofas` as a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, but the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are being updated.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) but has been decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four input integers, and the rest of the input remains to be read, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four input integers**
