The code appends a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. Initially, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples, but its first (and only given) tuple is now `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. This means that after the execution of the code, `sofas` will contain three tuples, with the first two tuples being the original ones and the third tuple being `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` which is also the first tuple. Therefore, the first and the last tuples in `sofas` will be the same.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 - 1 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, `sofas` is a list containing three tuples, where the first and the last tuples are `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and the second tuple is the original second tuple in `sofas`.**
