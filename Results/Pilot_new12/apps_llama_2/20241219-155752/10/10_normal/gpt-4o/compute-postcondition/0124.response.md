Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list. If `y1` is greater than `y1_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. `left_count` and `right_count` contain the total counts of sofas to the left and right of each sofa respectively, `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, all other conditions regarding `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` remain unchanged as described in the precondition.***
