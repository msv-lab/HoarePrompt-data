Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the element at index `i` in `left_count` is incremented by 1, and the state of `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of all variables remains unchanged, as there is no else part to modify them.***
