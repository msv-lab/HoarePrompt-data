The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not terminate the loop, but rather passes control to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop provided in the code snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined. 

Assuming the given code is part of a loop, the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration. The values of the variables before the `continue` statement are not changed by the `continue` statement itself.

Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the values of the variables do not change directly as a result of the `continue` statement, because `continue` itself does not alter variable values. It only affects the flow of the program.

Therefore, after executing the `continue` statement, the state of the variables remains as it was before the statement, assuming no other operations are performed between the `continue` statement and the end of the current iteration.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the second tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the second tuple in `sofas`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
