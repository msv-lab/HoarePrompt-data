To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

The code is appending a tuple containing four input integers (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) to the list `sofas`. 

Given the initial state:
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `n` and `m` are integers.
- `sofas` is an empty list.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are four input integers.
- The rest of the input remains to be read.

The impact of the code is that it adds a new element to the `sofas` list. The new element is a tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Since the code only modifies the `sofas` list by adding a new tuple to it, the values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. The list `sofas` is no longer empty but now contains a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `n` and `m` are integers.
- `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are four input integers.
- The rest of the input remains to be read.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are four input integers, and the rest of the input remains to be read**
