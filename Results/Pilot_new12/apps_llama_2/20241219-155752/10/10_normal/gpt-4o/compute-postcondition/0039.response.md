Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists that may need updating based on new `j`, the first tuple in `sofas` has elements `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and for a given index `j`, the tuple at index `j` in `sofas` has elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, and if `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, implicitly incrementing `i` (or `j`) to the next index, otherwise the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
