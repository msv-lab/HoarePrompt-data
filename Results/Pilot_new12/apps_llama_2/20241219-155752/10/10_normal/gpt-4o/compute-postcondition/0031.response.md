Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the current value of `left_count` is a list where the `j`th element is 1 and the rest are zeros, otherwise the current value of `left_count` remains a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count` is a list where the `j`th element is 1 and the rest are zeros, otherwise the current value of `right_count` remains a list of `d` zeros, the first tuple in `sofas` has elements `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and for a given index `j`, the tuple at index `j` in `sofas` has elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `i` equals `j`, maintaining the initial state of all other variables. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j` and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
