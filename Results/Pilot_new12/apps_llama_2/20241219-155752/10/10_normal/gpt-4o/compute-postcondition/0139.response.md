Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 2, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the third tuple in the `sofas` list. If `i` equals `j`, we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop; since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, this condition is never met and the program will not continue to the next iteration of the loop based on this condition***
