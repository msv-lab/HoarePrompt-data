Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then the value at index `i` in `bottom_count` is incremented by 1, and the state of `left_count`, `top_count`, and `right_count` remains unchanged; otherwise, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
