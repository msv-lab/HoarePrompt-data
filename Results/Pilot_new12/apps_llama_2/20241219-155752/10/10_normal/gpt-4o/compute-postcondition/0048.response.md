Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then the value at index `i` in `bottom_count` is incremented by 1. In all cases, if neither of the above conditions is met, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and `left_count` and `right_count` remain the same.***
