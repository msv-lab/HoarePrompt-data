The given Python code unpacks the `j-th` tuple in the `sofas` list into the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is conceptually in its next position if `i` equals `j`, `x1_j` is the first element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `y1_j` is the second element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `x2_j` is the third element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas**.
