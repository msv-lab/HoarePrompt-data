The input is well-formed and follows the given format. The first line contains an integer `d` which is now read and converted to an integer. 

`d` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^5. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: The input is well-formed, `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), the rest of the input remains to be read.

Output State: **The input is well-formed, `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), the rest of the input remains to be read.**
