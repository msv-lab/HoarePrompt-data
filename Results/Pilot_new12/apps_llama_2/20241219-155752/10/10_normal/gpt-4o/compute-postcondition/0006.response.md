According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again, because the loop runs `d` times. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are four input integers, and the rest of the input remains to be read. The loop variable `_` is not used, so we don't need to consider it. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 1. However, since we're only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we should consider that the loop has already executed once, so `d` should be at least 2 but since it is a counter we decrease it by 1.
State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) but has been decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are four input integers, and the rest of the input remains to be read**
