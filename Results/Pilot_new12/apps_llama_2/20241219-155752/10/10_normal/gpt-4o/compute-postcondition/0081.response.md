According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1. So, `j` should be 1. Since `j` is used to iterate over the `sofas` list, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` should be equal to the second tuple in `sofas`. 

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the second tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the second tuple in `sofas`**
