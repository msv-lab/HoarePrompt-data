Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, indicating that the sofa's position is to the right of the sofa at `sofas[0]`. The `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, and given the conditions that led to this point, if `x1` was less than `x1_j` and `x2` was less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[0]` would have been increased by 1, otherwise, it retains its previous value.**
