The given code is a `continue` statement. This statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. 

Since `continue` does not change any variable values, the Output State will be the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the third tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the third tuple in `sofas`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
