Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, `j` is 0, if `i` equals `j` (which is 0), then the current value of `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from the last valid tuple in the `sofas` list if it exists, and we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.**
