The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are updated to be the elements of the tuple at index `j` in the list `sofas`. Since `j` equals 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` will be equal to the third tuple in `sofas`. 

The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are not changed and are still equal to the third tuple in `sofas`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the third tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the third tuple in `sofas`, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 2**
