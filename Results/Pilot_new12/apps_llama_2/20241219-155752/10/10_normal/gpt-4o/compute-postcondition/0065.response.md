Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` contain the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa, respectively. The current value of `i` is 0, which is also the current value of `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equals the first tuple in `sofas`.**
