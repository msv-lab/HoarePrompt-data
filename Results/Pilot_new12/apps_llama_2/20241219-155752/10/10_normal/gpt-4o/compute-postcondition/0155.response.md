The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`n` and `m` are integers, 
`sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, 
`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, 
`left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, 
`right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, 
`top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, 
and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, 
`i` equals 0, 
`left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, 
`right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, 
`top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, 
`bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`, 
and `target_sofa` equals 1 
and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
