The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 2, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the third tuple in the `sofas` list, `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1**
