The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will have no effect on the program.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `sofas`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `sofas`, `x2` is the third element of the first tuple in `sofas`, `y2` is the fourth element of the first tuple in `sofas`, and the current values of `i` and `j` are equal**
