According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and `d` must be greater than 1.
State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the second tuple in the `sofas` list**
