The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
