The code initializes a list `left_count` with `d` zeros. The initial state of the variables `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, where each tuple represents four input integers, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros**
