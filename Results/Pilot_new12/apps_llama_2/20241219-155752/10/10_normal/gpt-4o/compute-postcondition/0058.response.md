Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is conceptually in its next position if `i` equals `j`, `x1_j` is the first element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `y1_j` is the second element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `x2_j` is the third element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` remains unchanged. If the condition `y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j` is not met, then no changes are made to `bottom_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, or `right_count[i]`.**
