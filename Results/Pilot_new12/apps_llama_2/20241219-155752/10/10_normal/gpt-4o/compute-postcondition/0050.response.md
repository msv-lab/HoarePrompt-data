The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. 

Given the initial state: `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, and `j` is conceptually in its next position.

The values of the variables do not change but we move to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is conceptually in its next position, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
