The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since the code is empty and doesn't affect any of the variables, we can conclude that no variables will have their values changed.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 2, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the third tuple in the `sofas` list and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
