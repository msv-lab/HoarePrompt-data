To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code reads:
```python
for _ in range(d):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
```

The initial state consists of:
- `d` as an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `n` and `m` as integers read from the input,
- `sofas` as an empty list,
- The rest of the input remains to be read.

After the loop executes, the following can be inferred:
1. The value of `d` dictates how many times the loop executes. Since the loop runs `d` times, `d` must be at least 1 to execute the loop at least once. However, its value does not change within the loop.
2. `n` and `m` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain constant throughout the execution.
3. `sofas` starts as an empty list. With each iteration, it appends a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers. After all iterations, `sofas` will contain `d` tuples.

Given this analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop finishes executing will be:
- `d` remains an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), but since it dictates the number of iterations, its original value is what matters for determining the loop's execution count.
- `n` and `m` are integers, unchanged from their initial state.
- `sofas` will be a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple representing four input integers.

If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if `d` were less than 1, but since `d` is defined as being between 1 and 10^5, this scenario does not align with the given initial conditions), the variables would retain their initial values:
- `d` would still be as initially defined (though this scenario contradicts `d`'s defined range),
- `n` and `m` would remain unchanged,
- `sofas` would remain an empty list.

However, given `d`'s defined range (1 to 10^5), the loop will always execute at least once, and thus, `sofas` will not remain empty.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, where each tuple represents four input integers.**
