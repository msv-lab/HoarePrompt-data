Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, and `j` is conceptually in its next position if `i` equals `j`, otherwise the state remains unchanged as there is no else condition.**
