Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, `i` equals 0, if `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`, then `target_sofa` equals 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged**
