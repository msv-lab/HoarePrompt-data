To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given Initial State:
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `n` and `m` are integers
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers
- `i` equals 0
- `j` equals 1
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the second tuple in `sofas`
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the second tuple in `sofas`
- If `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no change occurs

Given Code:
```python
x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]
```

Since `j` equals 1, this code assigns the values of the second tuple in `sofas` to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`. 

The initial state already specifies that `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the second tuple in `sofas`, which means these variables already hold the values of the second tuple. Therefore, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` do not change as a result of this operation because they are being assigned the same values they already have.

However, since this is an assignment operation and not a conditional or loop control statement, the condition "If `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no change occurs" does not directly apply to this specific line of code. It seems to be a part of a larger loop structure not shown in this snippet. 

Thus, focusing solely on the provided code and initial state, the variables directly affected are `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, but their values are not changing because they are already equal to the second tuple in `sofas`. The states of other variables (`d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unaffected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the second tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the second tuple in `sofas**
