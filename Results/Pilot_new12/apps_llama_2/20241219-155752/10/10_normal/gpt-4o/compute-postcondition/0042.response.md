Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the elements at index `i` in `left_count`, `top_count`, and `right_count` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The tuple at index `j` in `sofas` has elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`.**
