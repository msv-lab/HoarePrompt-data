The code `n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`, respectively. The `strip()` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and `split()` splits the input into a list of strings separated by whitespace.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, the rest of the input remains to be read**.
