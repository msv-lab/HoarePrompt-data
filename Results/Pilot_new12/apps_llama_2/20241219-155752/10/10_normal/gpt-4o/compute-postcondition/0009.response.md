To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for _ in range(d):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `_` (a throwaway variable) is within the range of `d`. Since `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) and has been decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0 after the decrease.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` has been decreased by 1. So, if `d` was initially between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), after decreasing by 1, it will be between 0 and 10^5 - 1 (inclusive). However, for the loop to execute again, `d` must be at least 1.

Given that `n`, `m`, and `sofas` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition (the loop depends solely on `d`), their states do not need adjustment based on the loop execution condition itself. 

However, considering the context that we're looking at adjustments for the loop to execute one more time and assuming `d` was decreased as part of the previous iteration's loop body (not shown), for the loop to continue, `d` must be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration. Given `d` has been decreased by 1, and assuming this decrease happens as part of the loop's body or before the next iteration begins, `d` will be one less than its previous value.

State: **`d` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 - 1 (inclusive) but must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
