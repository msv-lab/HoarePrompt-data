Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` equals 0, `j` equals 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equal the second tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` equal the second tuple in `sofas`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[0]` is increased by 1, and if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the state of `right_count[0]` remains unchanged. If the condition `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j` is not met, then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.***
