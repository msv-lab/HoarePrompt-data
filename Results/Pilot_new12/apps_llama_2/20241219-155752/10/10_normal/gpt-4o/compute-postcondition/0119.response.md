Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from the first tuple in the `sofas` list. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the current value of `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa with `right_count[0]` increased by 1. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the current value of `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa where `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the current value of `left_count` and `right_count` contain the total counts of sofas to the left and right of each sofa respectively. `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j` and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
