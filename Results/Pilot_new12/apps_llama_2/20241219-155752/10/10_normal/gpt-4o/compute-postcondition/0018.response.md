To adjust the states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(d):`, which means the loop will execute `d` times, with `i` taking values from 0 to `d-1`. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `n` and `m` are integers
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers
- `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` zeros

For the loop to execute, the critical piece of information is the value of `d`, as it determines the number of iterations. Since `d` must be between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), the loop will execute at least once. 

The initial state of `i` before the loop starts is not defined, but once the loop begins, `i` will be 0 in the first iteration. 

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to execute, we consider:
- `d` must be within its defined range and greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.
- Other variables' states (`n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count`) are already defined but are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, which solely depends on `d`.

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` zeros, `i` is 0**
