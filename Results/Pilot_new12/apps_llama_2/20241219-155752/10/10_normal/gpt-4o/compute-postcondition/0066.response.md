The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. However, since we do not have any loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` contain the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa, respectively, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` equals the first tuple in `sofas`.**
