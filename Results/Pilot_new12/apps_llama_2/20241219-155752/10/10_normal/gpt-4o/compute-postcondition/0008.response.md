The code appends another tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. Initially, `sofas` contains one tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, so after appending another tuple, `sofas` will contain two tuples, both being `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) but has been decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing two tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four input integers, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four input integers**
