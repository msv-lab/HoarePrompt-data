The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. In this case, the `break` statement will cause the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

However, the values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` contains the total counts of sofas to the right of each sofa, `top_count` contains the total counts of sofas above each sofa, and `bottom_count` contains the total counts of sofas below each sofa, `i` equals 1, `target_sofa` equals 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
