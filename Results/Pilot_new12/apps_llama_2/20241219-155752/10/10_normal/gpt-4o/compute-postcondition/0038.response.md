The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no explicit loop provided in the code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger loop structure, likely iterating over the `sofas` list given the context.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the impact on the program is that it will skip to the next iteration of the loop without executing any code that follows the `continue` statement within the loop body.

Checking the previous values of the affected variables:
- `d` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `n` and `m` are still integers, but their values haven't been changed by the `continue` statement.
- `sofas` is still a list containing `d` tuples.
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are still input integers.
- `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists that may need updating, but the `continue` statement does not affect their current state directly.
- The elements of the tuples in `sofas` (e.g., `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and their counterparts for a given index `j`) remain unchanged.
- `i` (or `j`) is incremented to the next index implicitly by the loop mechanism, not directly by the `continue` statement.

The `continue` statement does not alter any variable's value directly; it merely controls the flow of the loop. Therefore, after executing the `continue` statement, the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop, and all variables retain their current values unless changed by subsequent code, which is not shown here.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists that may need updating based on new `j`, the first tuple in `sofas` has elements `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and for a given index `j`, the tuple at index `j` in `sofas` has elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop, implicitly incrementing `i` (or `j`) to the next index.**
