According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The other variables `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `sofas` is an empty list, but they do not affect the execution of the loop. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use.

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `sofas` is an empty list, the rest of the input remains to be read**
