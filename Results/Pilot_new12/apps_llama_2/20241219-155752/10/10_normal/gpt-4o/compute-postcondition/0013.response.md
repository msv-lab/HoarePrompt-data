The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each of the input values, which are split by spaces. The input values are expected to be integers.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `n` and `m` are integers, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, where each tuple represents four input integers, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer**
