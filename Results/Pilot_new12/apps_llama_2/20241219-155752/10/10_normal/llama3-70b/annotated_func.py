#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of four non-negative integers representing coordinates of a sofa and sofas is a list of lists of four non-negative integers, each representing coordinates of a sofa.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers, `left` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are to the left of `sofa`, `right` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are to the right of `sofa`, `top` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are above `sofa`, `bottom` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are below `sofa`.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the number of sofas to the left of `sofa`, the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, the number of sofas above `sofa`, and the number of sofas below `sofa`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sofa, represented as a list of four non-negative integers, and a list of sofas, where each sofa is a list of four non-negative integers, and returns the count of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the given sofa. The function considers the first pair of coordinates of each sofa for comparison. If a sofa comparison results in the same x-coordinate, it checks the y-coordinate to determine if it's above or below. Similarly, if the y-coordinates match, it compares the x-coordinates to determine if it's to the left or right. The function returns four values: the number of sofas to the left, the number of sofas to the right, the number of sofas above, and the number of sofas below the given sofa. The function handles edge cases where the input sofa is equal to one of the sofas in the list, as it skips comparisons with itself. However, the function assumes that the input list of sofas contains at least one sofa and does not perform any error checking for empty lists. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input sofa or any sofa in the list has fewer or more than four coordinates, which may lead to errors if such cases occur. After executing the function, the state of the program includes the returned counts and the original input variables remain unchanged.
