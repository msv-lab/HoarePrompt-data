You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases. Specifically, it only checks if the first cell of one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first cell of another sofa. It does not consider the second cell of each sofa.

In the given problem description, the definition of one sofa being to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa is based on any cell of one sofa being to the left, right, top, or bottom of any cell of another sofa. The program does not implement this definition correctly.

A correct implementation should check all possible pairs of cells from two different sofas and count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, or bottom based on these pairs.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            if (sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] < s[1][0]) or (sofa[1][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] < s[1][0]):
                left += 1
            if (sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] > s[1][0]) or (sofa[1][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] > s[1][0]):
                right += 1
            if (sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] < s[1][1]) or (sofa[1][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] < s[1][1]):
                top += 1
            if (sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] > s[1][1]) or (sofa[1][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] > s[1][1]):
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, this corrected function still has a bug because it counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, or bottom for each sofa independently. It should count these numbers for all cells of a sofa.

To correctly implement the `func_1` function, we should iterate over all cells of a sofa and compare them with all cells of other sofas.

Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = set()
    for s in sofas:
        cells.add(s[0])
        cells.add(s[1])
    for cell in cells:
        if cell not in sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < cell[0] or sofa[1][0] < cell[0]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > cell[0] or sofa[1][0] > cell[0]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < cell[1] or sofa[1][1] < cell[1]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > cell[1] or sofa[1][1] > cell[1]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left // 2, right // 2, top // 2, bottom // 2)
```

However, this function still does not count the number of sofas correctly. It should count the number of sofas based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

To correctly implement the `func_1` function, we should iterate over all sofas and compare their cells with the cells of the given sofa.

Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            for cell in s:
                if cell[0] < sofa[0][0] and cell[0] < sofa[1][0]:
                    left += 1
                    break
                elif cell[0] > sofa[0][0] and cell[0] > sofa[1][0]:
                    right += 1
                    break
                elif cell[1] < sofa[0][1] and cell[1] < sofa[1][1]:
                    top += 1
                    break
                elif cell[1] > sofa[0][1] and cell[1] > sofa[1][1]:
                    bottom += 1
                    break
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of four non-negative integers representing coordinates of a sofa and sofas is a list of lists of four non-negative integers, each representing coordinates of a sofa.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers, `left` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are to the left of `sofa`, `right` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are to the right of `sofa`, `top` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are above `sofa`, `bottom` is the number of sofas in `sofas` that are below `sofa`.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the number of sofas to the left of `sofa`, the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, the number of sofas above `sofa`, and the number of sofas below `sofa`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sofa, represented as a list of four non-negative integers, and a list of sofas, where each sofa is a list of four non-negative integers, and returns the count of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the given sofa. The function considers the first pair of coordinates of each sofa for comparison. If a sofa comparison results in the same x-coordinate, it checks the y-coordinate to determine if it's above or below. Similarly, if the y-coordinates match, it compares the x-coordinates to determine if it's to the left or right. The function returns four values: the number of sofas to the left, the number of sofas to the right, the number of sofas above, and the number of sofas below the given sofa. The function handles edge cases where the input sofa is equal to one of the sofas in the list, as it skips comparisons with itself. However, the function assumes that the input list of sofas contains at least one sofa and does not perform any error checking for empty lists. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input sofa or any sofa in the list has fewer or more than four coordinates, which may lead to errors if such cases occur. After executing the function, the state of the program includes the returned counts and the original input variables remain unchanged.
