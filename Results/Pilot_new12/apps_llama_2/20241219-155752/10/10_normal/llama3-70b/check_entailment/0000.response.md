Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases. Specifically, it only checks if the first cell of one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first cell of another sofa. It does not consider the second cell of each sofa.

In the given problem description, the definition of one sofa being to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa is based on any cell of one sofa being to the left, right, top, or bottom of any cell of another sofa. The program does not implement this definition correctly.

A correct implementation should check all possible pairs of cells from two different sofas and count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, or bottom based on these pairs.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            if (sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] < s[1][0]) or (sofa[1][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] < s[1][0]):
                left += 1
            if (sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] > s[1][0]) or (sofa[1][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] > s[1][0]):
                right += 1
            if (sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] < s[1][1]) or (sofa[1][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] < s[1][1]):
                top += 1
            if (sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] > s[1][1]) or (sofa[1][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] > s[1][1]):
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, this corrected function still has a bug because it counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, or bottom for each sofa independently. It should count these numbers for all cells of a sofa.

To correctly implement the `func_1` function, we should iterate over all cells of a sofa and compare them with all cells of other sofas.

Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells = set()
    for s in sofas:
        cells.add(s[0])
        cells.add(s[1])
    for cell in cells:
        if cell not in sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < cell[0] or sofa[1][0] < cell[0]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > cell[0] or sofa[1][0] > cell[0]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < cell[1] or sofa[1][1] < cell[1]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > cell[1] or sofa[1][1] > cell[1]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left // 2, right // 2, top // 2, bottom // 2)
```

However, this function still does not count the number of sofas correctly. It should count the number of sofas based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

To correctly implement the `func_1` function, we should iterate over all sofas and compare their cells with the cells of the given sofa.

Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            for cell in s:
                if cell[0] < sofa[0][0] and cell[0] < sofa[1][0]:
                    left += 1
                    break
                elif cell[0] > sofa[0][0] and cell[0] > sofa[1][0]:
                    right += 1
                    break
                elif cell[1] < sofa[0][1] and cell[1] < sofa[1][1]:
                    top += 1
                    break
                elif cell[1] > sofa[0][1] and cell[1] > sofa[1][1]:
                    bottom += 1
                    break
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```
