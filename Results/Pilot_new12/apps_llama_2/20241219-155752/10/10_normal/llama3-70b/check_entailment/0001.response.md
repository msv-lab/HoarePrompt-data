Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

In the `func_1` function, the program checks if `sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]` to increment the `left` counter. However, this condition only checks if the first cell of the sofa is to the left of the first cell of another sofa and the y-coordinates are the same. It does not consider the case where the second cell of the sofa is to the left of another sofa.

Similarly, the conditions for `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are also incorrect. They only consider the position of the first cell of the sofa, not the second cell.

For example, if we have two sofas with coordinates (1, 1, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 1, 3), the function `func_1` will not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the top and bottom of the first sofa.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the positions of both cells of each sofa and count the number of sofas that satisfy the given conditions. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1], s[0], s[1]]
            cells.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
            if cells[0] in [sofa[0], sofa[1]] and cells[1] in [s[0], s[1]] and cells[0][0] < cells[1][0]:
                left += 1
            if cells[2] in [sofa[0], sofa[1]] and cells[3] in [s[0], s[1]] and cells[2][0] > cells[3][0]:
                right += 1
            cells.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
            if cells[0] in [sofa[0], sofa[1]] and cells[1] in [s[0], s[1]] and cells[0][1] < cells[1][1]:
                top += 1
            if cells[2] in [sofa[0], sofa[1]] and cells[3] in [s[0], s[1]] and cells[2][1] > cells[3][1]:
                bottom += 1
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)
```
