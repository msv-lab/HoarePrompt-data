Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. 

The problem description asks to count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. A sofa A is considered to be to the left of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. Similarly, sofa A is considered to be to the top of sofa B if there exist two cells a and b such that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A, and b is covered by B. The same conditions apply for the right and bottom sides.

However, the provided program only considers the first pair of coordinates of each sofa for comparison, which does not meet the requirements of the problem. The program should consider all the cells covered by each sofa, not just the first pair of coordinates.

For example, consider a sofa that covers cells (1, 1) and (1, 2), and another sofa that covers cells (2, 1) and (3, 1). The first sofa should be considered to be to the left of the second sofa, but the program would not count it as such because it only compares the first pair of coordinates (1, 1) and (2, 1), which are not the cells that determine the left-right relationship.

To fix this, the program should be modified to consider all the cells covered by each sofa when determining the left, right, top, and bottom relationships. 

Here is an example of how the function func_1 could be modified to meet the requirements of the problem description:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    sofa_cells = set(sofa)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = set(s)
            if any(x < s_x for x, y in sofa_cells for s_x, s_y in s_cells):
                left += 1
            if any(x > s_x for x, y in sofa_cells for s_x, s_y in s_cells):
                right += 1
            if any(y < s_y for x, y in sofa_cells for s_x, s_y in s_cells):
                top += 1
            if any(y > s_y for x, y in sofa_cells for s_x, s_y in s_cells):
                bottom += 1
    return left, right, top, bottom
```

This modified function correctly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa by considering all the cells covered by each sofa.
