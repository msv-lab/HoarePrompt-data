Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description states that a sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. This means that the program should check all cells of sofa A and all cells of sofa B to determine if A is to the left of B.

The current implementation of the `func_1` function only checks if the first cell of sofa A is to the left of the first cell of sofa B, which is not sufficient. 

For example, consider two sofas with coordinates (1, 1) (1, 2) and (2, 1) (2, 2). The current implementation would incorrectly determine that the first sofa is not to the left of the second sofa.

To fix this, the program should check all cells of sofa A and all cells of sofa B to determine if A is to the left of B. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    sofa_cells = set([sofa[0], sofa[1]])
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_cells = set([s[0], s[1]])
            if any(x < y for x in sofa_cells for y in s_cells if (x[1] == y[1])):
                left += 1
            if any(x > y for x in sofa_cells for y in s_cells if (x[1] == y[1])):
                right += 1
            if any(x < y for x in sofa_cells for y in s_cells if (x[0] == y[0])):
                top += 1
            if any(x > y for x in sofa_cells for y in s_cells if (x[0] == y[0])):
                bottom += 1
    return left, right, top, bottom
```

This corrected version checks all cells of sofa A and all cells of sofa B to determine if A is to the left of B. It uses sets to efficiently store and compare the cells of the sofas.
