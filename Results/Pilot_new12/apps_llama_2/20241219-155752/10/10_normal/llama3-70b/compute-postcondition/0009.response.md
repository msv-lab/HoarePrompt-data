Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list and is not equal to `sofa`. The current value of the first element of `sofa` is equal to the current value of the first element of `s`, and the current value of the second element of `sofa` is less than the current value of the second element of `s`. If the previous conditions were met before entering the if condition, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. In all other cases before entering the if condition, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` remain unchanged, which means `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
