The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The precondition conditions and variables `sofa`, `sofas`, `s`, and the conditional statement related to `left` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list. If `sofa[0][0]` is less than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` equals `s[0][1]`, then `left` remains as is. `right` is increased by 1.**
