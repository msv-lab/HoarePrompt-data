The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1, but the initial state does not mention `left`. The initial state includes `sofa`, `sofas`, and `s`, where `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list. Since `left` is not mentioned in the initial state, its initial value is unknown. 

After executing the code, `left` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `left + 1`, where `left` is its initial unknown value. The states of `sofa`, `sofas`, and `s` are not affected.

Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list, `left` is `left + 1`**
