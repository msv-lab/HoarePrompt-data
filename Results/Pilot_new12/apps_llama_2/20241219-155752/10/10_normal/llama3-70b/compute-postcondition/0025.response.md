Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the second sofa in the `sofas` list. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are updated based on the comparisons between the corresponding elements of `sofa` and `s`: if `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` equals `s[0][1]`, then `right` is increased by 1; if `sofa[0][0]` is less than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` equals `s[0][1]`, then `left` is increased by 1 and `right` is increased by 1; if `sofa[0][1]` is less than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `top` is increased by 1; if `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0]` equals `s[0][0]`, then `bottom` is increased by 1; otherwise, the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged; if `s` equals `sofa`, then no updates are made.**
