The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa` and `sofas`. `sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers representing coordinates of a sofa, and `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers, each representing coordinates of a sofa. After executing the function body, the function returns the number of sofas to the left of `sofa`, the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, the number of sofas above `sofa`, and the number of sofas below `sofa`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sofa and a list of sofas, and return the count of sofas in each of the four directions (left, right, above, below) relative to the given sofa.
