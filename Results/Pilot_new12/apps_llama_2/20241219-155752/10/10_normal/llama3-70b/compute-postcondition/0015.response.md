Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are updated based on the comparisons between the elements of `sofa` and `s`: if the first element of `sofa` is less than the first element of `s` and the second elements are equal, then `left` is 1 and `right`, `top`, `bottom` are 0; if the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second elements are equal, then `right` is 1 and `left`, `top`, `bottom` are 0; if the first elements are equal and the second element of `sofa` is less than the second element of `s`, then `left` remains 1 if it was 1 before, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 0; if the first elements are equal and the second element of `sofa` is greater than the second element of `s`, then `left`, `right`, `top` are 0 and `bottom` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` remain unchanged, meaning they are all 0. If `s` equals `sofa`, then no changes are made to `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, so they remain 0.**
