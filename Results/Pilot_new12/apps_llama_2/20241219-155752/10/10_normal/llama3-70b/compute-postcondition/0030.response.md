Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four non-negative integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of four non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list. If `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` equals `s[0][1]`, then `right` is increased by 1. If `sofa[0][0]` is less than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` equals `s[0][1]`, then `left` is increased by 1. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
