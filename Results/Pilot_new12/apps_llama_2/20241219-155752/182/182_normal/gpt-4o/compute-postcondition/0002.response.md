The codecalculates the value of `turns` based on the `normalized_angle`. The `normalized_angle` is between -359 and 359. The expression `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` first calculates the difference between 360 and `normalized_angle`, then performs integer division by 90, and finally takes the result modulo 4. The result of this expression will be an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, which will be between -359 and 359, `turns` is ((360 - (`x` % 360)) // 90) % 4**
