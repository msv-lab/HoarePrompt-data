The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is designed to operate based on an external integer input `x`, representing a camera angle in degrees, where `-10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. The sign of `x` indicates the direction of camera rotation, with positive values denoting clockwise rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation. 

Since the specific return values or conditions based on `x` are not provided in the problem statement, we can't detail the return values directly related to `x`. But we can describe the functionality based on the input constraints and the typical expectation of such a function.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates based on an external integer input representing a camera angle, and it returns a value based on the angle, considering the direction of camera rotation.**
