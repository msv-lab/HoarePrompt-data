The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x` modulo 360. The value of `x` is an integer input representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. 

Since `x` is an integer and we are taking modulo 360, `normalized_angle` will be an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive) if we consider the remainder of the division of `x` by 360. However, for any integer `x`, `x % 360` will be in the range (-359, 359] if `x` is negative, and [0, 359] if `x` is non-negative.

To ensure `normalized_angle` is within the range [0, 360), we consider two cases:
1. If `x % 360` is negative, add 360 to it.
2. If `x % 360` is non-negative, the result is already in the desired range.

However, the problem statement and code given do not explicitly handle the case where `x % 360` is negative. The modulo operation in Python returns a result with the same sign as the divisor (360 in this case), but when the dividend (`x`) is negative, the result will be negative. So, to ensure `normalized_angle` is within [0, 360), the code should ideally be `normalized_angle = x % 360` and then adjusted if necessary.

But since we're working with the given code `normalized_angle = x % 360`, and considering Python's modulo behavior:
- For negative `x`, `x % 360` will give a negative result.
- For non-negative `x`, `x % 360` will give a non-negative result between 0 and 359.

The state of `x` does not change, as it is not reassigned. Therefore, `x` remains an integer input representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. The new variable `normalized_angle` is introduced, representing the camera angle normalized to a value between -359 and 359.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, which will be between -359 and 359.**
