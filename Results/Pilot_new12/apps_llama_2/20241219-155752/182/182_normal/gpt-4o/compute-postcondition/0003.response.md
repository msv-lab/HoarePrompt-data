The given code simply prints the value of `turns`. The value of `turns` is calculated as ((360 - (`x` % 360)) // 90) % 4, which is based on the input `x` and does not change after the print statement is executed. 

The print statement does not modify the values of `x`, `normalized_angle`, or `turns`. It only outputs the value of `turns` to the console.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, which will be between -359 and 359, `turns` is ((360 - (`x` % 360)) // 90) % 4 and the value of `turns` has been printed**
