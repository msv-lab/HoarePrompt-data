Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code appears to correctly solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Normalization of the Angle**: The code takes an input angle `x` and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 360 degrees by using the modulo operator (`x % 360`). This handles cases where the input angle is greater than 360 degrees or less than 0 degrees, ensuring that the angle is always within a manageable range.

2. **Calculation of Turns**: The formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to rotate the image so that its up direction is minimally deviated from vertical. This formula works as follows:
   - `360 - normalized_angle` calculates the angle that, when added to the current angle, results in a full 360-degree rotation. This effectively "inverts" the angle to find how much more rotation is needed to align the image with the vertical.
   - `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90` calculates how many 90-degree turns are needed to achieve this inverted angle. The `//` operator performs integer division, discarding the remainder and giving the number of full 90-degree turns.
   - The `% 4` operation ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 3, because any number of turns greater than 3 can be reduced to a smaller equivalent number of turns by subtracting multiples of 4 (since 4 turns would bring the image back to its original orientation).

3. **Handling of Counter-Clockwise Rotations**: Negative input angles represent counter-clockwise rotations, which are correctly handled by the normalization step. When a negative angle is input, the normalization process (`x % 360`) correctly converts it to its equivalent positive angle within the 0 to 360-degree range.

4. **Minimizing Turns**: The code aims to minimize the number of 90-degree turns. By considering all possible rotations (0 to 3 turns), it effectively finds the minimum rotation needed to minimize the deviation from vertical.

Given the examples provided in the problem description, the code correctly outputs:
- For an input of 60 (clockwise rotation), the output is 1, which is correct because one 90-degree turn results in a 30-degree deviation from vertical, less than other options.
- For an input of -60 (counter-clockwise rotation), the output is 3, which aligns with the explanation provided in the problem description, demonstrating the code's ability to handle both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations correctly.

Overall, the code seems to correctly address all aspects of the problem description and handles various input scenarios without evident flaws, assuming valid inputs will always be provided.
