Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem description. 

The issue is with the line where the number of turns is calculated: `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.

This line does not correctly determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

To find the minimum turns, we need to consider the absolute difference between the normalized angle and the nearest multiple of 90. However, the given code does not accurately calculate this.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = min((90 - normalized_angle) % 360 // 90, 
                (180 - normalized_angle) % 360 // 90, 
                (270 - normalized_angle) % 360 // 90, 
                (360 - normalized_angle) % 360 // 90)
    print(turns)
```
This version calculates the minimum turns by comparing the normalized angle to the nearest multiples of 90 (i.e., 0, 90, 180, and 270). The `min` function returns the smallest number of turns required to align the image with the vertical.

Alternatively, the problem can be solved by finding the remainder of the normalized angle when divided by 90, and then taking the minimum between this remainder and its complement (90 - remainder). This approach also ensures that the minimum number of turns is calculated correctly.

Here's another corrected version:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    remainder = normalized_angle % 90
    turns = min(int((remainder > 45) and 4 - int(normalized_angle / 90) or int(normalized_angle / 90)), 
                4 - min(int((remainder > 45) and 4 - int(normalized_angle / 90) or int(normalized_angle / 90)), 4))
    print(turns)
```
Both of these corrected versions should produce the correct output according to the problem description.
