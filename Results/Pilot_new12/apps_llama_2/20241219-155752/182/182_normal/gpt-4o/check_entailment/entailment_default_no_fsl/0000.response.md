Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which the up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

However, the code calculates the number of turns required to face the direction opposite to the input angle, not the minimum deviation. The line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not necessarily give the minimum number of turns to achieve the minimum deviation.

For example, if the input angle is -60, the code will calculate the normalized angle as 300 (since -60 % 360 = 300), and then calculate the number of turns as (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 3, as explained in the note section of the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should compare the deviation from vertical for different numbers of turns (0, 1, 2, and 3) and find the minimum deviation. 

A correct implementation could be:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    min_deviation = float('inf')
    min_turns = 0
    for turns in range(4):
        total_angle = (normalized_angle - turns * 90) % 360
        if total_angle > 180:
            deviation = 360 - total_angle
        else:
            deviation = total_angle
        if deviation < min_deviation:
            min_deviation = deviation
            min_turns = turns
    print(min_turns)
```
This code calculates the deviation from vertical for each possible number of turns and finds the minimum deviation, which corresponds to the correct number of turns.
