To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The expression `(x + 90 - 1)` is evaluated first. This simplifies to `(x + 89)`.
2. The result of `(x + 89)` is then divided by 90 using integer division (`//`), which discards the remainder and returns the quotient.
3. The quotient from the previous step is then taken modulo 4 (`% 4`), which returns the remainder when divided by 4.

Given that `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive) and `x` is not equal to 0, let's consider how `(x + 89)` behaves:
- When `x` is in the range -359 to -90, `(x + 89)` will be negative, and after integer division by 90, it will be a negative integer. After taking modulo 4, it can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the original value of `x`.
- When `x` is in the range -89 to 89 (excluding 0), `(x + 89)` will be between 0 and 178, making the quotient after division by 90 either 0 or 1. Taking modulo 4 will then result in either 0 (for quotients that are multiples of 4) or 1 (for quotients that are 1 more than multiples of 4).
- When `x` is in the range 90 to 359, `(x + 89)` will be positive and greater than or equal to 179, leading to a quotient of 2 or more after division by 90. Taking modulo 4 can then result in 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the quotient.

However, considering the specific calculation `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, let's refine our approach:
- For any integer `x`, when we add 89 (which is equivalent to adding 90 and then subtracting 1), the division by 90 will essentially categorize the result into quartiles based on the angle offset by 89 degrees from `x`.

The key here is recognizing the cyclic nature of the modulo operation and how adding 89 shifts `x`. Since `x` is an angle in degrees modulo 360 and is not equal to 0, the expression is essentially determining in which quadrant (offset by 89 degrees) `x` falls.

Given the modulo 4 operation, the output will be an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive, depending on the result of `(x + 89) // 90`. This value is then printed.

The variable `x` retains its original value since it is not reassigned within the code snippet. Thus, the output state is that `x` remains an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive), not equal to 0, and the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` evaluates to an integer between 0 and 3, which is then printed.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive), `x` is not equal to 0, and the value of `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` has been printed.**
