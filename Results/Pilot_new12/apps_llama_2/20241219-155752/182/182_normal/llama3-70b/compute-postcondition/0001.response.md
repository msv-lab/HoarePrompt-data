The code `x = x % 360` calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 360 and assigns this value back to `x`. This operation effectively brings the value of `x` within the range of 0 to 359 (inclusive) because the remainder of any division by 360 will fall within this range.

Given that `x` is initially an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), after performing `x = x % 360`, the value of `x` will be an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive). However, because the modulus operation in Python can return a negative result if the dividend is negative, we need to consider how this operation handles negative numbers. For negative numbers, the result of `x % 360` will be negative, but it will be the negative equivalent of a value between 0 and 359. For instance, -1 % 360 = -1, which is equivalent to 359 in terms of the circle (or angle), and -360 % 360 = 0.

Thus, after the operation, `x` will represent an angle in degrees within the range of -359 to 359, but due to the circular nature of angles, values outside 0 to 359 can be normalized to this range by adding or subtracting 360. For a complete normalization to the 0-359 range, one would consider `x = x % 360`, and if `x` is negative, add 360 to `x`. However, based on the provided operation alone (`x = x % 360`), `x` will be between -359 and 359, encompassing all possible angles in a circular representation, with negative values indicating angles that could be represented as positive by adding 360.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive), representing the camera angle in degrees modulo 360.
Output State: **`x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive), representing the camera angle in degrees modulo 360.**
