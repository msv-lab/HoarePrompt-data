## Step 1: Identify the parameters and constraints
The function `func` does not explicitly define any input parameters, but it is implied that it receives an integer `x` as input, representing the camera angle in degrees, with the constraint -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.

## Step 2: Determine the return value based on the output description
Since the output description is missing, we cannot determine the specific return value or conditions for returning different values. However, we can still describe the functionality based on the input parameter.

## Step 3: Describe the functionality of the function
The function `func` accepts an implied integer parameter `x`, representing the camera angle in degrees, with the constraint -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.

The final answer is: **The function accepts an implied integer parameter x, representing the camera angle in degrees, within the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.**
