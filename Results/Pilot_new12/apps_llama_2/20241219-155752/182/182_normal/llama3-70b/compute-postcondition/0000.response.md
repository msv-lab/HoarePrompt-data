The code `x = int(input())` implies that the function will receive an integer input from the user. 

`x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. 

Since the input is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, with -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, the output state is: `x` is an integer input between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), representing the camera angle in degrees.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), representing the camera angle in degrees.**
