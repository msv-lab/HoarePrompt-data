Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly solve the problem described. The task is to determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to rotate an image captured by a camera so that its deviation from "true up" is minimized. The camera's angle of rotation is given as input.

The code takes the camera angle, normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 by taking the modulus with 360, and then calculates the required number of turns using the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This formula effectively categorizes the angle into one of four quadrants, determining the minimum number of 90-degree turns needed.

The output hints agree with the code's behavior and provide insight into its logic. The code handles the normalized angle correctly, printing 0 when the angle is 0 (no turns needed) and calculating the required turns for any other angle.

The examples provided in the problem description demonstrate the code's correctness. For instance, when the input is 60 (clockwise rotation), the output is 1, and when the input is -60 (counter-clockwise rotation), the output is 3, both of which match the expected results based on the problem description.

Given that the code's logic aligns with the problem's requirements, it does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would compromise its correctness. Assuming valid input is provided, the code will correctly determine the minimum number of 90-degree turns needed to minimize the image's deviation from "true up".
