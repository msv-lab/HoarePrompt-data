The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code, but we need to evaluate it against the output hints for confirmation.

The output hints indicate that the program normalizes the input angle to a value between 0 and 359, and then calculates the required number of turns based on this normalized angle. This process aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic for determining the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to align the camera with the vertical. The provided formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` effectively categorizes the angle into one of four quadrants, which corresponds to the minimum number of turns required.

Given that the output hints confirm the program's behavior and no evident errors or inconsistencies are present, we can conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
