Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input handling**: The program accepts an integer input `x` representing the camera angle in degrees, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Normalization**: The program normalizes the input angle to a value between 0 and 359 by taking the modulus of the input angle with 360 (`x = x % 360`). This ensures that the program handles large input angles correctly.

3. **Special case handling**: The program checks if the normalized angle `x` is 0, and if so, it prints 0. This is because no rotation is needed if the camera is already aligned with the vertical direction.

4. **Rotation calculation**: For non-zero normalized angles, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align the camera with the vertical direction. The calculation `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is correct and can be explained as follows:
   - Adding 90 to `x` is equivalent to rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise.
   - Subtracting 1 from the result is a trick to ensure that the division by 90 rounds down to the nearest integer (i.e., it's equivalent to performing floor division).
   - Dividing by 90 and taking the result modulo 4 gives the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align the camera with the vertical direction.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns, which aligns with the problem description.

In summary, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible input cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
