In the provided code snippet, `print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)` checks the value of `max_len`. If `max_len` is greater than 0, it prints that value; otherwise, it prints 0. The value of `max_len` remains unchanged after the execution of the code, only its value is printed. The other variables (`s` and `n`) are not affected either.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `n` is the length of `s`.**
