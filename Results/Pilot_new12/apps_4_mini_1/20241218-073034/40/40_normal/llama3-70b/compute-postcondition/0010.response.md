The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring taken from the string `s` starting at index `i` and ending just before index `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, this means that `substr` will take the first two characters from the string `s`. The initial conditions for `s`, `max_len`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `substr`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `substr` is the substring `s[0:2]`.**
