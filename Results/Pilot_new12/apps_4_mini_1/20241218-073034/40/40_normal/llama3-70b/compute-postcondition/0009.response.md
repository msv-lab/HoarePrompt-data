According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will run as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `substr` is the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will be 2, and for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 2. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
