According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` starts at `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the starting value of `j` will be 2, since `i + 1` equals 2. 

Next, the loop condition states that `j` should iterate until it reaches `n + 1`. Since `j` starts at 2, it means that for the loop to run, `n` must be at least 2 (so that `j` can go from 2 to 2 or more, meaning `j` will have valid iterations).

At the end of the last iteration, the state of `j` will be `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we deduce the following:

1. `i` starts at 1.
2. `n` must be at least 2 (so that the loop can execute).
3. `j` begins at 2 (the value of `j` on the first loop iteration).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2**
