The variable `max_len` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr`, which is `s[1:3]`, will be 2 since it takes the second and third characters of the string `s` (assuming `s` has at least 3 characters as `n` is greater than or equal to 3). Therefore, `max_len` is assigned the greater value between its previous value and 2.

The other variables, `s`, `substr`, `i`, `n`, and `j`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `substr` is `s[1:3]`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3.**
