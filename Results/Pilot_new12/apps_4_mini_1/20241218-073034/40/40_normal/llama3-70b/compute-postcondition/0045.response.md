The line of code `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` compares `max_len` with the length of `substr` and assigns the larger value to `max_len`. 

The initial state indicates that `max_len` can either be unchanged or equal to 2, and `substr` is equal to `s[2:5]`, which means its length will depend on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `substr` will have a length between 1 and 3 depending on the characters in `s` from index 2 to 5.

The evaluation of `len(substr)` will yield a value based on the actual string `s`. However, we know that the length of `substr` can at most be 3, as it spans three characters starting from index 2. 

Considering the value of `max_len`:
- If `max_len` is unchanged or equals 2, and `len(substr)` can be 1, 2, or 3, we find:
  - If `len(substr)` is 1, `max_len` remains unchanged (if it was greater than 1).
  - If `len(substr)` is 2, `max_len` remains 2 (if it was also 2 or less).
  - If `len(substr)` is 3, then `max_len` is updated to 3, irrespective of its previous value.

Without loss of generality, we do not assign an explicit value to `max_len` beyond stating that it can be either unchanged or 2, and we understand that it now will account for at least a length of 3 if `len(substr)` equals 3.

Updating the output state:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is either unchanged or now equal to 3 (if `len(substr)` equals 3), `i` remains 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `j` is 5, and `substr` is equal to `s[2:5]`.**
