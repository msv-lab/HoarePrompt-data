To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the given initial state and the structure of the loop code.

1. Initially, `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters.
2. `max_len` starts as the length of the longest non-palindromic substring.
3. `i` is initialized at 2, meaning the loop will start forming substrings from the third character (index 2).
4. `n` is the length of `s`, which is at least 2 since `s` is non-empty.
5. `j` starts at `n + 1` and will be decremented after every iteration where the loop runs to check substrings.

The loop constructs substrings starting from index `i` and varying the endpoint `j`. It evaluates each substring, and if it's not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` with the maximum value found so far.

Given that the loop executes every time `j` progresses from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, the loop will run for `n - i` times. At each iteration:
- `substr` captures substrings from `s[i:j]`, where `j` changes from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
- After all iterations, the value of `max_len` will be equal to the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found within all possible substrings of `s` starting at index `i`.

Finally, since `j` will have taken on all values from `3` up to `n + 1`, after the loop concludes:
- If no non-palindromic substring was found, `max_len` will remain unchanged from its value at the beginning of the loop. 
- If at least one non-palindromic substring was found, `max_len` will reflect the longest such substring.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s` starting from index 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is `n + 1`.**
