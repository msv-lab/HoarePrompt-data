According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of the string `s`. Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `s`, and `j` is `n + 1`**
