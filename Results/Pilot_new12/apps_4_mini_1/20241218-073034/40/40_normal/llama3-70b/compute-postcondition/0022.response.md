The value of `max_len` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a substring of `s` and is not a palindrome, its length is 1. Thus, `len(substr)` evaluates to 1. 

The value of `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1. However, the exact previous value of `max_len` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only conclude that `max_len` will be at least `max_len` (its previous value) or increase to 1 if it was less than 1 prior to execution.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters; `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 1; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `substr` is the substring `s[1:2]`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, indicating that `substr` is not a palindrome.**
