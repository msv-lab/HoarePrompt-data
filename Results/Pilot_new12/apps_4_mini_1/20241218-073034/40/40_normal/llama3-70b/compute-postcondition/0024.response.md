According to the code, the loop will continue to execute while `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, and `substr` is the substring `s[1:2]`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3**
