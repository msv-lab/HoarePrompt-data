According to the code, the loop execution depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increase by 1 to become 4. Additionally, for the loop to be able to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `substr` is `s[1:3]`, if `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2, while `i` remains 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is 4**
