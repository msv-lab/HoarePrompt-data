`substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which translates to `s[0:3]`, effectively taking a substring from `s` starting at index `0` and ending at index `3`. Since `i` is `0` and `j` is `3`, `substr` will contain the first three characters of `s`. The values of `s` and `max_len` remain the same, along with `n`, which must still be greater than or equal to `3`. The variable `i` remains `0`, while `j` remains `3`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `substr` is the substring `s[0:3]`.**
