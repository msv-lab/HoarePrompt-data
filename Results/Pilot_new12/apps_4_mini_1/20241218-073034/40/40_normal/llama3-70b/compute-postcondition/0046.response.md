Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is either unchanged or now equal to 3 if the length of `substr` equals 3, `i` remains 2, `n` is greater than 4, `j` is 5, and `substr` is equal to `s[2:5]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` may be equal to 3; otherwise, the postcondition reflects the unchanged values of `max_len`, `i`, `n`, and `j`, while `substr` remains equal to `s[2:5]`.***
