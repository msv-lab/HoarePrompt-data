The substring `substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `substr` becomes `s[1:3]`, which means it takes the characters from the string `s` starting at index 1 and ending at index 2 (inclusive). The string `s` remains unchanged, as well as the values of `max_len`, `n`, and `i`. The value of `j` is also not modified. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `substr` is `s[1:3]`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3.**
