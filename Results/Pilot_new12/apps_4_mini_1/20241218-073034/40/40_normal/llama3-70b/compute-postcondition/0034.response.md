According to the code, the loop is designed to execute while `j` varies from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` is the length of the string `s`, the loop will execute as long as `j` takes values starting from `3` (since `i + 1 = 3`) up to `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute, it's necessary that `n + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. Since `i + 1` is `3`, `n` must be at least `2` (which it will be if the string has a length of at least 2, and since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer).

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `j` will equal `n + 1`, which implies that the loop covers `j` values from `3` up to `n + 1`. 

Hereâ€™s how to clarify the state adjustments:

- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` must be 2 or greater (since it is initialized to the length of `s`).
- `i` begins at 2 (consistent with starting values).
- `j` must start from `3` (because of how `j` is set to `i + 1`).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` starts at 3**
