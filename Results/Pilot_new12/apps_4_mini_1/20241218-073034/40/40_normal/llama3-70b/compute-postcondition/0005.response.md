The value of `substr` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, `substr` will take the first character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. After executing the code, we have:

- `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s`, which is at least 1.
- `max_len` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` remains 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
