The length of the string `s` is found using the `len` function, which counts the number of characters in the string. Since `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, its length is guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most 50 characters. Thus, `n` is assigned a value equal to the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`**.
