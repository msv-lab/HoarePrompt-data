According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, which is equal to the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be at least 1, which implies the loop can execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will begin at 0 for the first iteration.

Since `n` is already defined as equal to the length of `s`, and `s` is guaranteed to be non-empty, the main conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute. Thus, `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop begins.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of s, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**
