According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, and `j` starts at 3. Since `j` is initialized to 3, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 after the current iteration, making it 4. Also, since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is either unchanged or 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the character in `s` at index 2 which is not a palindrome.**
