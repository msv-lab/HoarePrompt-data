The value of `max_len` is updated to the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is a character from `s` at index 2 and is not a palindrome by definition, we can derive the following:

- `len(substr)` will always be equal to 1, as `substr` is a single character.
- `max_len` should be updated to either its current value or 1, whichever is larger.

Thus, if `max_len` was originally greater than or equal to 1, it will remain unchanged; if it was less than 1, it will be updated to 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is either unchanged or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` starts at 3, and `substr` is the character in `s` at index 2 which is not a palindrome.**
