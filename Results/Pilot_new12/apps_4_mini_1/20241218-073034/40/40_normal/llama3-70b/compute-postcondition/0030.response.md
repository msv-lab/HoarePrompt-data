Let's analyze the code snippet step by step:

1. `substr` is derived from `s`, specifically `s[1:4]`, which means it contains characters from index 1 to index 3 of `s`. The length of `substr` will always be less than or equal to 3 if `s` has a minimum length of 4 (as `n >= 4`).
   
2. The function `max()` compares the current value of `max_len` and `len(substr)`. Since `len(substr)` is potentially 3 (if `s` has 4 or more characters), `max_len` can either remain the same or become 3 depending on which value is larger.
   
3. The other variables `s`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged by this operation.

Given this analysis, we conclude that `max_len` will either remain its current value or be updated to 3 (provided that its current value was less than 3).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `substr` is `s[1:4]`, `max_len` may either remain its previous value or be updated to 3, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4.**
