Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` starts at 3, and `substr` is the character in `s` at index 2. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse (i.e., `substr` is not a palindrome).***
