Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `substr` is the substring `s[0:2]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, the conditions remain as stated; otherwise, there is no change since there is no else part in the code.***
