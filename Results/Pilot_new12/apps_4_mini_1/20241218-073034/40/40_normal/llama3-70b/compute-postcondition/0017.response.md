Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of s, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0.  
Code of the loop:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    substr = s[i:j]
    if substr != substr[::-1]:
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

To analyze the state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we must consider the following points:

1. The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` (which is 1) to `n + 1`, incrementing `j` each time until it reaches `n + 1`.
2. For each iteration, a substring `substr` is taken from `s`, starting at index `i` to index `j`.
3. The condition checks if `substr` is not a palindrome. If it is not, `max_len` is updated to the larger of its current value and the length of `substr`.

### Possible Outputs After Loop Execution

- If `s` consists entirely of the same character (like "aaa"), all substrings will be palindromes, and `max_len` will remain 0.
- If there are varying characters, `max_len` will be updated to reflect the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found during the iterations.

### General Conclusions

After the loop executes:
- `max_len` will be the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`.
- `j` will equal `n + 1` after the last iteration.
- `i` remains 0 throughout since it does not change in the loop.
- `n` is the original length of `s`.

Considering these points:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
