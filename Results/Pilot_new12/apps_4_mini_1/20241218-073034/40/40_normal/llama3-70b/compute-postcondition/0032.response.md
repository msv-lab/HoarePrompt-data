To determine the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop code and the relationships between the variables.

1. The loop iterates over `j`, starting from `i + 1` (which is 2) to `n + 1`. This means the loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to the length of `s`.

2. Within the loop, a substring `substr` is created from `s` starting at index `i` (which is 1) and ending at index `j`. The loop checks if this substring is not a palindrome and updates `max_len` accordingly.

3. Since the loop is designed to test all possible substrings starting from `s[1]`, it will continue executing for each index of `j` until it reaches the end of the string `s`.

Assuming the string `s` has a length of `n`, the loop will execute a total of `n - i` iterations if we start at `i = 1`, meaning it will iterate from `j = 2` to `j = n`.

At the end of all iterations:
- `max_len` will ultimately be the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in any of the iterations from `s[1:n]`.
- `i` will remain 1, as there are no modifications made to `i` within the loop.
- `n` will remain constant, representing the length of the original string.
- `j` will take the value `n + 1`, which is beyond the bounds of the original string.

Taking all of this into consideration, we can define the final output state as follows:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
