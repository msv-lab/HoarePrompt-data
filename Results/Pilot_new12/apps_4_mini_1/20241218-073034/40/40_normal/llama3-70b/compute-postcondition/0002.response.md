The variable `max_len` is assigned the value 0. The initial state provided specifies that `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, and `n` is equal to the length of `s`. This means `n` has a value greater than or equal to 1 (since `s` is non-empty) and less than or equal to 50 (due to the length constraint).

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, and `max_len` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is 0**.
