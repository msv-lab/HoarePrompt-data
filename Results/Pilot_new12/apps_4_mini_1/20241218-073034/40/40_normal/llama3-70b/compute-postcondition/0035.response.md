The variable `subs` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `j`. Given that `i` is currently 2 and `j` is 3, the substring `substr` will take the characters between these indices. 
This means the value of `substr` is the character in `s` at index 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` starts at 3, `substr` is the character in `s` at index 2.**
