Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `substr` is the substring `s[0:3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, the condition holds; otherwise, there is no execution specified for the else part.***
