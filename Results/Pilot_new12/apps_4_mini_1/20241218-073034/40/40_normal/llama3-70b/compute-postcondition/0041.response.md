In this scenario, we have the following initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string
- `max_len` is either unchanged or 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `j` is 4
- `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`, which means it pulls characters from the string `s`, starting at index 2 up to, but not including, index 4.

Now we assess the line of code executed: 
```
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `len(substr)` calculates the length of the substring created from `s`, which pulls two characters starting at index 2 and ending at index 4. Since `substr` is constructed from two indices, its length is 2.
2. The `max` function is then called with `max_len` and `len(substr)`. Depending on the current value of `max_len` (which is either unchanged or 1):
   - If `max_len = 1`, `max(max_len, len(substr))` will yield a result of 2.
   - If `max_len` is already a value greater than or equal to 2, `max` will simply return that value.
3. `max_len` is updated to the result of this calculation.

The potential outputs for `max_len` could be:
- If `max_len` started at 1, it would be updated to 2.
- If `max_len` started at a value of 2 or more, it remains the same.

Since `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` retain their initial states, the only change is the possible update to `max_len`.

Considering that `max_len` could either be unchanged from a value of 2 (if it started at 2 or greater) or updated from 1 to 2 (if it started at 1):

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is either unchanged or 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`.**
