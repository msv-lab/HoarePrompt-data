The value of `max_len` is assigned to be the maximum of its previous value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is equal to `3` (since `substr` is `s[0:3]`, which extracts the first three characters of the string `s`). Given that the initial value of `max_len` is `2`, after executing the code, `max_len` will be updated to `3` because `max(2, 3)` is `3`. The other variables maintain their original values. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `substr` is the substring `s[0:3]`.**
