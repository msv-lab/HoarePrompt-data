According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. There are no specific adjustments needed for `max_len` or `j` at this point, as they do not influence the loop execution condition directly.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, and `j` is `n + 1`**
