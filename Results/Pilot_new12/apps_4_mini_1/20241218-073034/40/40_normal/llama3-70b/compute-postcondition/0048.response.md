To understand the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the provided code snippet. The loop iterates over all possible substrings of the string `s` and checks if they are not palindromic. It updates `max_len` with the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, the outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `n - 1`, meaning it will iterate `n` times. The inner loop generates all possible substrings starting from each `i`, which means for each `i`, `j` will range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Any non-empty string has palindromic and non-palindromic substrings.

After executing the nested loops, `max_len` will contain the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found in `s`. If all substrings are palindromic, `max_len` will remain 0.

Therefore, after all iterations have finished:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`, `n` is the length of `s`.**
