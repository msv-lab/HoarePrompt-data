The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to index `j`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `substr` will hold the value of the character in `s` at index 1. The length of the string `s` is not specified, but since it is a non-empty string, `s[i:j]` is valid as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Other variables (`max_len`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters; `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring in `s`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `substr` is the substring `s[1:2]`.**
