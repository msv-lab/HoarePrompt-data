The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value or the length of `substr`. Since `max_len` is initially 0 and `substr` is the first character of the non-empty string `s`, the length of `substr` is 1. Therefore, the new value of `max_len` will be 1. The other variables retain their values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
