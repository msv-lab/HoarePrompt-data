Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, and `substr` is the substring `s[1:2]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 1, while `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2.***
