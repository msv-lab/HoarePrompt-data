According to the code, the loop will execute if the range given to `j` produces at least one value. The range is determined by `i + 1` to `n + 1`. In this case, since `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of `s`, `i + 1` simplifies to 1. The loop will then iterate from 1 to `n + 1`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be at least 1 since `s` is a non-empty string. Given that `i` is 0, `j` will start at 1 when the loop executes. The loop will run as long as `n >= 1`.

Therefore, to summarize: for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, `j` will start at 1, and during the first execution, `j` will take the value of 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` (which is at least 1), `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1**
