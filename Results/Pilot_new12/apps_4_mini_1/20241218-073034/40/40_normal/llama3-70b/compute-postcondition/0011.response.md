In the given code snippet, `max_len` is being assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. The initial values are:

- `max_len` is set to 1
- `substr` is the substring `s[0:2]`, which has a length of 2 (since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).

Thus, the value of `len(substr)` is 2. The `max` function will compare `max_len` (which is 1) and the length of `substr` (which is 2). Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to 2 after this operation.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `substr` is the substring `s[0:2]`.**
