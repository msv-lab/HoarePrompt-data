According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop starts with `j` taking values from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, which means in this case, `j` will start at 3. Given that at the end of the last iteration `j` is 4, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next number, which would be 5.

Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 (since it goes up to `n + 1`, making `n` equal to 4 not sufficient for the loop to run one more time).

So, to summarize:
- The next value of `j` would be 5.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string and `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` can either be unchanged or equal to 2, `i` remains 2, `n` must be greater than 4, and `j` is 5**
