According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, starting from `i + 1` and going up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. The loop is intended to execute again if `j` can take the next integer value, which in this case means `j` needs to be increased by 1. Since `j` is currently 2 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 3. Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again, as `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `n` is currently greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `max_len` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `substr` is the substring `s[0:2]`.**
