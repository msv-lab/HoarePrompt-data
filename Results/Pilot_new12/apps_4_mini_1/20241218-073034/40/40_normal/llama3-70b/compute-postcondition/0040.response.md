The variable `substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`, which extracts a substring from the string `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, the substring will consist of the characters in `s` from index 2 up to but not including index 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is either unchanged or 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring `s[2:4]`.**
