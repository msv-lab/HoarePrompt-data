The function reads a non-empty string of lowercase English letters from input, analyzes all possible substrings to determine the length of the longest non-palindromic substring, and prints that length. If all possible substrings are palindromic or if there are no substrings to analyze (which is not the case given the input constraints), it prints 0. It accepts no parameters and operates solely on the internal variable `s`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input string contains only one characterâ€”such a string will always result in a maximum length of 0 since there are no non-palindromic substrings possible.
