You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. It reads an input string `s`.
2. It initializes a variable `max_len` to track the length of the longest non-palindrome substring.
3. The program then uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of `s`. For each substring, it checks if the substring is not equal to its reverse (which is the condition for being a palindrome).
4. If it finds a non-palindrome substring, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length found so far.
5. Finally, it prints `max_len` if it's greater than 0; otherwise, it prints 0.

The implementation checks all possible substrings, ensuring that it carefully considers every possible case of palindromes. The edge case of strings where all characters are the same (like "qqqqqqqq") is also handled correctly as it returns 0, indicating no non-palindrome substrings exist.

Since the logic correctly handles all defined scenarios, including the examples from the problem description, the program is correct. Furthermore, any string of length 1 is a palindrome, and this program does not erroneously count it as a non-palindrome. Thus, no counterexamples are found, and the solution adheres to the problem description comprehensively.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a non-empty string of lowercase English letters from input, analyzes all possible substrings to determine the length of the longest non-palindromic substring, and prints that length. If all possible substrings are palindromic or if there are no substrings to analyze (which is not the case given the input constraints), it prints 0. It accepts no parameters and operates solely on the internal variable `s`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the input string contains only one characterâ€”such a string will always result in a maximum length of 0 since there are no non-palindromic substrings possible.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
