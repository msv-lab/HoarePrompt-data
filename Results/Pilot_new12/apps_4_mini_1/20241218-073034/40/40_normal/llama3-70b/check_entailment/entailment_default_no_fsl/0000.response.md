Correctness: **False**

The provided program intends to calculate the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of a given input string. While the approach appears to check every possible substring for the non-palindromic condition, there is a crucial edge case that the program fails to account for: when the input string consists of all the same characters.

For example, for the input "aaa", all possible substrings are palindromic (i.e., "a", "aa", "aaa"). The expected output for this input should be `0`, as specified in the problem description. However, according to how the program is written, the maximum length (`max_len`) will still return `0`, but the logic behind checking for palindromes does not allow it to explicitly handle strings of the same character differently when it could potentially skip unnecessary checks.

Furthermore, the explanation in the output hints states: "the function does not handle the case where the input string contains only one characterâ€”such a string will always result in a maximum length of 0 since there are no non-palindromic substrings possible." This becomes confusing since the program does return `0` for a single character string, but the overall implication is that it does not preemptively avoid evaluating certain scenarios, which could lead to performance inefficiencies. 

Thus, the program does not meet all the requirements from the description for every potential case. It could be logically optimized to skip evaluations for strings of repeated characters upfront, and there is a concern about inconsistency in handling edge cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
