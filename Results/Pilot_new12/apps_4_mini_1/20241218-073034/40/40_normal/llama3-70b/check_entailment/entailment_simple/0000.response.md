Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program operates in relation to the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string `s`, which comprises lowercase English letters and has a maximum length of 50 characters, adhering to the problem constraints.

2. **Substring Generation**: The program generates all possible substrings of `s` using nested loops. The outer loop starts from each character, and the inner loop extends to generate substrings by including successive characters. This ensures that all substrings are considered.

3. **Palindrome Check**: For each substring, the program checks if it is a palindrome by comparing the substring to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). This accurately determines if the substring is not a palindrome.

4. **Max Length Calculation**: If a substring is found that is not a palindrome, the program compares its length to the currently stored maximum (`max_len`) and updates it if the new length is greater. This ensures that `max_len` holds the length of the longest non-palindromic substring at the end of the iterations.

5. **Output Logic**: Finally, the program outputs `max_len` if it is greater than zero; otherwise, it outputs `0`. This aligns perfectly with the problem's requirement that if no non-palindromic substrings exist, the output should be `0`.

Given that all required logic specified in the problem description is implemented correctly, the program fulfills its purpose for every valid input case described. Therefore, the correctness of the program can be stated confidently as **True**.
