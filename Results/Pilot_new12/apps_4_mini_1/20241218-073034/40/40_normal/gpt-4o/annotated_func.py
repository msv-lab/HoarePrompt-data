#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, with a length of at most 50 characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string 's' composed solely of lowercase English letters with a length of up to 50 characters. It checks whether the string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. The function returns True if 's' is a palindrome and False otherwise. There are no additional checks for empty inputs or non-lowercase strings, but it is guaranteed that 's' is non-empty and adheres to the stated constraints based on the initial program state described.
