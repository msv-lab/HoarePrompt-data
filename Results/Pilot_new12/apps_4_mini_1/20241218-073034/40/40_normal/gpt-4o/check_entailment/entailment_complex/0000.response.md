Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string `s` with lowercase English letters. The given constraints specify that the length of the string is at most 50 characters, which is properly handled by the program.

2. **Single Character Check**: If the input string has a length of 1 or less, it correctly prints `0` since a single character (or an empty string) cannot provide a non-palindrome substring.

3. **Palindrome Check**: The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If `s` itself is not a palindrome, the program correctly calculates the length of the substring which is the entire string `s`, fulfilling the requirement of returning the maximum length of a non-palindrome substring.

4. **Trimming Start and End**: If `s` is a palindrome, the program checks the substrings obtained by removing the first character (`s[1:]`) and the last character (`s[:-1]`). If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, the program calculates the length of that substring (which is `len(s) - 1`) and prints it. This approach ensures that the longest non-palindromic substring is found, even if the full string is a palindrome.

5. **All Characters Same Check**: If all characters in `s` are the same (e.g., "qqqqqqqq"), then both `s[1:]` and `s[:-1]` will still be palindromic. In this case, the program properly returns `0`, as per the problem requirements.

Overall, the logic implemented in the program ensures that all specified conditions from the problem statement are met, and it correctly identifies the length of the longest non-palindromic substring or outputs `0` when there is none. The program performs checks systematically, ensuring that it adheres to specified requirements for all potential input cases described in the problem statement.

Thus, the program is correct in its implementation.
