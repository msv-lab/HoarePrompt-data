Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input string is entirely made up of the same character but is longer than 1 character. For example, the input "aaaaa" is a palindrome, and the function `func_1` will return `True`. Consequently, none of the checks to produce the output will succeed, resulting in the output being 0. However, according to the problem description, there are no non-palindromic substrings in "aaaaa," so it should correctly return 0. 

However, let's consider the input "abcba". This input is a palindrome as well. The code attempts to check whether the entire string is a palindrome first. If it fails, it checks the two cases of removing the first or last character, which will again lead to further palindromes being generated until the same incorrect logic returns 0 instead of possibly acknowledging substrings smaller than three characters that are non-palindromic (like "abc").

Additionally, the program relies on checks against the whole string, which can lead to missing cases of non-palindromic combinations in larger ranges.

The fact that it misses such conditions for longer strings composed of identical characters or palindromic behavior shows that the program fails to deliver the expected output accurately in all potential situations, thus making the output incorrect.
