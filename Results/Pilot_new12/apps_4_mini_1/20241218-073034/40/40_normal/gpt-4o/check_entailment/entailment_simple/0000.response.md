Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description through the following logic:

1. **Palindrome Check:** The program defines a helper function `func_1(s)` that checks whether a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). This is essential as the problem centers around identifying substrings that are not palindromes.

2. **Handling Short Strings:** The first part (`if len(s) <= 1`) handles edge cases where the string length is 0 or 1. These cases are trivial as they cannot contain any non-palindrome substrings and should return 0, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Checking the Whole String:** The conditional `elif not func_1(s):` checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If true, it returns the length of `s`, as the longest substring that is not a palindrome is the string itself.

4. **Checking Substrings:** The next conditions (`elif not func_1(s[1:]):` and `elif not func_1(s[:-1]):`) check if the substring without the first character or the substring without the last character is not a palindrome. Both of these checks are necessary because they ensure that if the whole string is a palindrome, but removing one character leads to a non-palindrome, the program can identify it correctly and returns the length of `s` minus 1.

5. **Final Case:** The last `else` statement returns 0, which correctly corresponds to the scenario where all possible substrings of `s` are palindromes, as stipulated in the description.

Overall, the program correctly identifies whether there are non-palindromic substrings and calculates their lengths, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements in all specified cases.
