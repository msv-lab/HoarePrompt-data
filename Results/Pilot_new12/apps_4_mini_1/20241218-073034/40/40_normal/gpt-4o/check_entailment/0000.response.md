To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem description recap:
The goal is to find the length of the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome. If all substrings are palindromes, the output should be `0`.

### Analyzing the program:
```python
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` and trims any whitespace.
2. **Length Check**: If the string length is `<= 1`, it outputs `0`, which is correct since a single character cannot have a non-palindromic substring.
3. **Main Logic**:
    - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If it's not, the output is the length of `s`.
    - It then checks the substring `s[1:]` (removing the first character). If this is not a palindrome, it outputs `len(s) - 1`.
    - It checks the substring `s[:-1]` (removing the last character) next. If this is also not a palindrome, it outputs `len(s) - 1`.
    - If none of the conditions are met, it outputs `0`.

4. **Palindrome Check (func_1)**: This function correctly determines if the string is a palindrome.

### Finding Edge Cases:
- Consider the string `aabb`. This string itself is not a palindrome (since `aabb` != `bbaa`), so the program should return `4` (the length of `aabb`). The program would work correctly here.
- For the string `aaaa`, all substrings (e.g., `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, `aaaa`) are palindromes. The correct output should be `0`. The program checks this correctly.
- For the string `abcba`, it is a palindrome, and thus checks against `bcb` and reports the correct length `4` for `abcb` or `ab` if it removes one character only. The output here would incorrectly be `0` because it doesn't handle removing characters effectively after checking the whole string.

### Edge Case Found:
For a string like `aa` or sequences of the same letter (e.g., `aaaaa`), the first condition will output `0`, and while it works as expected, the checks with the removal of the edges do not apply correctly to non-repeated strings or complex sequences. 

Thus, if you enter:
- Input: `abccba` - Even though `abccba` is a palindrome, the longest non-palindrome would still be `6` since the whole substring can be checked correctly.

There exists the `abba` pattern which would yield `3` but the whole program would return `0` unnecessarily.

Since the program does not account for all edge cases correctly, it can lead to incorrect results.

**Conclusion**: There are cases where the output could be wrong, hence, the provided implementation doesn't fulfill all mentioned requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
