To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic implemented and consider various test cases.

The program checks for the longest non-palindromic substring using the following structure:
1. If the input string \( s \) has a length of 1 or less, it returns 0, since a single character is always a palindrome.
2. If \( s \) itself is not a palindrome, it returns the length of \( s \).
3. If the substring excluding the first character (i.e., \( s[1:] \)) is not a palindrome, it returns \( len(s) - 1 \).
4. If the substring excluding the last character (i.e., \( s[:-1] \)) is not a palindrome, it also returns \( len(s) - 1 \).
5. If all of the above checks fail, it returns 0.

### Analysis of the Logic
Now let's consider some test cases to validate the given implementation.

1. **Test Case: `"mew"`**
   - `func_1("mew")` -> `False` (not a palindrome)
   - Expected output: 3 (itself is not a palindrome, and has length 3)
   - Actual output: 3 

2. **Test Case: `"wuffuw"`**
   - `func_1("wuffuw")` -> `True` (it is a palindrome)
   - `func_1("uffuw")` -> `False` (not a palindrome)
   - Expected output: 5 (since `wuffu` is not a palindrome)
   - Actual output: 5

3. **Test Case: `"qqqqqqqq"`**
   - `func_1("qqqqqqqq")` -> `True` (it is a palindrome)
   - `func_1("qqqqqqq")` -> `True` (it is still a palindrome)
   - Expected output: 0 (all substrings are palindromes)
   - Actual output: 0

4. **Additional Test Case: `"a"`**
   - `len("a") <= 1`, should return 0.
   - Correct output: 0 
   - Actual output: 0

5. **Additional Test Case: `"abc"`**
   - `func_1("abc")` -> `False` (not a palindrome)
   - Expected output: 3 (itself is not a palindrome)
   - Actual output: 3 

### Finding a Failing Case
One potential issue arises with strings composed of the same character repeated, such as `"aa"`. 

- For the string `"aa"`:
   - `func_1("aa")` returns `True` (it is a palindrome).
   - The code checks `func_1("a")`, which is also a palindrome.
   - Therefore, it would return 0.
   - However, the longest non-palindromic substring to consider would be the complete string itself in certain contexts.

Let's consider the string `"aabb"`:
- `func_1("aabb")` returns `False` (not a palindrome).
- Expected output: 4
- Actual output: 4

### Conclusion
After testing various edge cases, including palindromes and non-palindromic structures, the logic does return the expected outputs in all observed cases. 

As I did not find any case where the implementation deviates from the expected output based on the problem description and it accurately returns the length of the longest non-palindromic substring or 0 when necessary:

Correctness: **True**
