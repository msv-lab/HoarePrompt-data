To assess the correctness of the provided annotated program against the problem description, we first need to understand what the program is expected to do.

### Problem Statement Recap:
Kolya wants to check whether he can express his total game-coins `n` as a sum of multiples of three specific costs:
- Houses: 1,234,567 game-coins
- Cars: 123,456 game-coins
- Computers: 1,234 game-coins

The task is to find non-negative integers \( a, b, c \) such that:
\[ a \times 1,234,567 + b \times 123,456 + c \times 1,234 = n \]

If such a combination exists, the program should print "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Program Overview:
1. The function `func()` takes an input `n` and iteratively tries different combinations for \( a \) and \( b \).
2. For each valid \( a \), it computes the maximum valid \( b \).
3. It calculates the resulting \( c \) based on the remaining value after subtracting the contributions from \( a \) and \( b \).
4. If it finds a valid combination that meets the equation, it prints "YES" and exits.
5. If after exhausting all possibilities a combination is not found, it prints "NO".

### Logical Flows in the Code:
1. The outer loop computes potential values for \( a \) based on how many houses Kolya could buy without exceeding `n`.
2. The inner loop calculates potential values for \( b \) (number of cars) based on the remaining coins after accounting for the cost of houses.
3. The variable \( c \) is computed as the number of computers that could be bought with the leftover coins. The equation checks if \( c \) is non-negative and a valid integer that satisfies the original equation.

### Verification:
- **Completeness**: The double loop will explore all combinations of \( a \) and \( b \) from their respective ranges. For each combination, it directly calculates whether \( c \) can be a valid non-negative integer.
- **Termination**: The program will terminate either when a valid combination is found (printing "YES") or all combinations are exhausted (printing "NO").
- **Correctness of Logic**: The mathematical operation involved maintains the condition that \( a, b, c \) must all be non-negative integers.

### Edge Cases:
- The program will handle cases where \( n \) is exactly 1,234 (the cost of a computer), where it can buy only computers. It also correctly processes larger values and combinations.
- The printed output is directly aligned with "YES" and "NO" as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic necessary to solve the problem as described. Thus, it effectively checks if `n` can be expressed as required.

Correctness: **True**
