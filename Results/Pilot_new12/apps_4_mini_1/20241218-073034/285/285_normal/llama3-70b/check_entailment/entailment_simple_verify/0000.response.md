Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description. Analyzing the annotated version confirms that the function systematically examines all potential combinations of purchasing houses, cars, and computers using a structured nested loop approach. The conditions established in the loops ensure that all monetary configurations permissible under the constraints are considered, leading to a valid "YES" or "NO" response. The annotations support the algorithm's functionality as it demonstrates that `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly calculated to ensure completion of the check against the input `n`. Therefore, the implementation meets the problem requirements and does so reliably for all valid inputs.
