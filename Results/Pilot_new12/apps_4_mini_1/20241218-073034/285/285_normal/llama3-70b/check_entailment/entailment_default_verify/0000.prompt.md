You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for a in range(n // 1234567 + 1):
        for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
            c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
            if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
                print('YES')
                exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the given program according to the problem description, let's break down the potential cases the function tries to cover.

The function `func` aims to determine if it is possible to represent a given number `n` using the equations involving purchasing houses, cars, and computers, where:

- Houses cost \(1,234,567\) game-coins
- Cars cost \(123,456\) game-coins
- Computers cost \(1,234\) game-coins

The core of the algorithm involves two nested loops which iterate over the potential quantities of houses and cars that can be purchased. For each combination of the number of houses `a` and cars `b`, the program computes how many computers `c` can be purchased with the remaining game-coins. 

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Outer Loop for Houses**: 
   - The outer loop runs through all possible values of `a` (houses), from `0` to `n // 1234567`. This range seems correct since you can't buy more houses than can fit in your total coins.

2. **Inner Loop for Cars**: 
   - The inner loop runs through all possible values of `b` (cars), adjusting for how many coins are left after buying `a` houses. 

3. **Computing Remaining Coins for Computers**: 
   - The program calculates how many computers `c` can potentially be bought with the remaining coins, which should work as intended.
   
4. **Condition to Print "YES"**: 
   - If there's a combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfies the equation, "YES" is printed and execution exits. If no combination works after checking all possibilities, "NO" is printed.

### Possible Edge Cases:
Now, let’s identify if there are any possible edge cases where the function might fail to provide correct results:
- For `n` values that are very close to the costs of the smallest item, which is `1,234`. For example, checking the values of 1233 and 1 (both should return "NO" since they can’t afford even one computer).
- Large values for `n` which should cover cases where combinations won't fit.

For high boundary values, specification within the ranges would need to cover scenarios where all combinations or none yield the desired total.

### Conclusion:
By reviewing the code's logic against the requirement of finding non-negative integers that satisfy the equation, it appears that:
- The code handles all the specified costs appropriately and iteratively checks each valid combination,
- It correctly recognizes when it can't find any valid combinations as well.

Since I could not identify a single case where the implementation fails based on the outlined problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The `func` implementation works correctly in all defined circumstances and adheres to the problem's requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function receives an integer input `n` where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), and checks if it is possible to express `n` as a combination of non-negative integer multiples of 1234567, 123456, and 1234. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' and exits. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and does not take any parameters. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is less than the smallest multiple (i.e., less than 1234), and situations where `n` can only be expressed using a single type of multiple. The logic indeed lacks any handling for invalid input or verification of the input's range upon receipt.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
