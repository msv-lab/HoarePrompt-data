The `exit()` command halts the execution of the program immediately, and thus, no further operations are performed on the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The values of these variables remain unchanged in the output state, but since no further processing occurs and the program terminates, we acknowledge that the program's execution has ended.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234; 'YES' is printed and the program terminates.**
