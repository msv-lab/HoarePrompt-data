Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `a` will be in the range from 0 to `n // 1234567`; `b` will be `((n - a * 1234567) // 123456)` at the last iteration or will not increment if `n - a * 1234567` is less than 123456; `c` will be determined as `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. If the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` is not satisfied for any combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output will not print 'YES' and the program will exit without changes to the variable states; if the loop does not execute, `a` remains 0, and `b` and `c` are not defined.**
