The code `exit()` is called to terminate the program. No variables are modified or returned in this case, but the execution stops, and the program leaves its current state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 2)`, `a` is `a + 1`, `b` is `((n - (a + 1) * 1234567) // 123456)`, `c` is `((n - (a + 1) * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234)` and 'YES' is printed; program execution is terminated.**
