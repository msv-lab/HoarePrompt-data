The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately without altering any of the existing variables. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unaffected. The output state simply reflects that no changes took place, but we acknowledge the exit from the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to `(n - 246912) // 1234`, conditioned on `n` being at least 1481479; and "YES" is printed. The program has exited without any changes to the variable states.**
