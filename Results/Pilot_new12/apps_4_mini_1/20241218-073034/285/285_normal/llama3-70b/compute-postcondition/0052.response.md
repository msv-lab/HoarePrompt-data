The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately without altering any variable values or changing the program's execution flow. Since the state specifically mentions that 'YES' has been printed, the output state must reflect that while other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **if `n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 2)`; `a` is now `a + 1`, `b` is 1, `c` is equal to `(n - (a + 1) * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
