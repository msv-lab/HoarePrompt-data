The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. None of the variables are updated or modified due to the execution of this code. The state of the variables remains the same as the initial state, and the program simply ends without returning a value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 1)`, `a` is now `a + 1`, `b` is 0, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`, and it holds that `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` is equal to `n`.**
