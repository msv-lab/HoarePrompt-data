The command `exit()` stops the execution of the program, which means that any further calculations or updates to variables will not occur. The variables themselves are not modified by this command. Therefore, the output state will maintain the precondition values while confirming that the program execution has been terminated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 1)`, `a` is updated to `a + 1`, `b` is 1, `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed; execution has been exited.**
