The code `exit()` does not change any variable values but terminates the program. Therefore, the states of the variables remain the same as before execution. 

The output will include the unchanged values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the confirmation that the program exits. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 2)`; `a` is `a + 1`; `b` is `0`; `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567) // 1234`; Output is 'YES' and the program exits.**
