Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 2)`, `a` is incremented by 1, `b` is the maximum value of `((n - a * 1234567) // 123456)` after all iterations, `c` is calculated as `((n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234)`; if the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` holds true for any combination of `b` and `c`, then 'YES' would be printed, otherwise the loop will terminate without printing anything.**
