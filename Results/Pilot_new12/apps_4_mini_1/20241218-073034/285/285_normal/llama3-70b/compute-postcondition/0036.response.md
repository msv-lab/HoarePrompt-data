Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 1)`, `a` has been incremented to `a + 1`, `b` is equal to `((n - a * 1234567) // 123456)`, `c` is `((n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234)`; the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` holds true and equals `n` if the loop executes completely. If the loop does not execute, then `b` is 0 and `c` remains as `((n - a * 1234567) // 1234)` ensuring `a` was incremented.**
