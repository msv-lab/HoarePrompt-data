To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The variable `n` is an integer that must be greater than `1234567 * (a + 1)`. This ensures that the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` indeed results in a non-negative integer for `b` to range over.

2. The statement `a` is incremented to `a + 1`. Therefore, we need to consider the new value of `a`, which is `a + 1`.

3. From the new `a`, the term `n - a * 1234567` can be calculated to see if it is sufficient for `b` to be at least 0. This requires the value of `n` to be sufficiently large given the new `a` value.

4. The range for `b` is given as `((n - a * 1234567) // 123456) + 1`. For `b` to be a valid range, `n` must be at least `a * 1234567`. If `a` is newly incremented, then `n` must be greater than or equal to:

   \[
   (a + 1) * 1234567
   \]

   Accounting for the adjustment in variable `a`, we derive that the adjusted constraints on `n` must still hold true.

Given these considerations, we formulate the adjustments that need to be made:

State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 1)`, `a` is now `a + 1`, `b` is now starting at 0 with the value of  `n` confirming that `n` must also ensure that `((n - a * 1234567) // 123456)` is non-negative, meaning `n` must still be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567` which is now `1234567 * (a + 1)`**.
