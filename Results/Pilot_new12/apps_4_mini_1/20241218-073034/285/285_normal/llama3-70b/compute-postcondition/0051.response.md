The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console but does not affect the values of any variables. The initial conditions for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` remain valid. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables while including the successful print statement.

Output State: **if `n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 2)`; `a` is now `a + 1`, `b` is 1, `c` is equal to `(n - (a + 1) * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
