The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'YES'. None of the existing variables `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c` are changed. Therefore, the output state includes all the prior variable states unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234; 'YES' is printed.**
