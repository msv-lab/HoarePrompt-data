The code `exit()` will terminate the program execution. Therefore, control exits from the program without any changes to the variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged since no further operations or exits alter their values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `1234567 * (a + 1)`; `a` is `a_old + 1`; `b` is 2; `c` is equal to `(n - (a_old + 1) * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234; 'YES' has been printed.**
