The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program but does not change any variable values. Therefore, all preexisting variables retain their values as defined in the initial state. The program may provide output but the internal variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9; `a` is 0; `b` is 0; `c` is equal to `n // 1234;` and the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, and the output printed is 'YES'**.
