The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The condition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 remains valid. Therefore, `n` is now the provided integer input.

Output State: **`n` is now an integer value obtained from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
