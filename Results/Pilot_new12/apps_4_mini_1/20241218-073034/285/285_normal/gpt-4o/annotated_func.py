    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least `0`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is at most `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative and can be less than `car_cost`, `b` can be at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, for some values of `b`, `remaining_after_cars` can either be divisible by `computer_cost` or not, determining if the program returns 'YES' or remains without a return.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and determines if it is possible to spend exactly `n` on a combination of houses, cars, and computers. The costs are fixed: 1 house costs 1,234,567, 1 car costs 123,456, and 1 computer costs 1,234. The function iterates over possible numbers of houses that can be bought, calculating the remaining amount of money after purchasing those houses, and then checks how many cars can be bought with the remaining amount. If the remaining amount after buying houses and cars can be expressed as an exact multiple of the computer's cost, the function returns 'YES'. If no combination leads to this scenario, it concludes by returning 'NO'. The function does not consider cases where n is less than the cost of the cheapest item, failing to check direct impossibility for such amounts and only addresses combinations of items indirectly.
