You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya could have spent all of his game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1` iterates over the possible number of houses he could buy, calculates the remaining coins, and then iterates over the possible number of cars he could buy with the remaining coins. If, after buying a certain number of houses and cars, the remaining coins can be evenly divided by the computer cost, the program concludes that it is possible to spend exactly `n` coins.

Key points ensuring the correctness:
1. **Range of iterations**: It checks every possible number of houses and cars.
2. **Modulo operation**: It correctly checks if the remaining coins can be entirely spent on computers.
3. **Non-negative integer constraints**: The loops inherently handle only non-negative integers since they start from 0.

The program efficiently explores all possible combinations within the constraints provided by the problem (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), and there are no edge cases identified where it would fail based on the problem description.

Overall, it successfully meets the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least `0`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is at most `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative and can be less than `car_cost`, `b` can be at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, for some values of `b`, `remaining_after_cars` can either be divisible by `computer_cost` or not, determining if the program returns 'YES' or remains without a return.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and determines if it is possible to spend exactly `n` on a combination of houses, cars, and computers. The costs are fixed: 1 house costs 1,234,567, 1 car costs 123,456, and 1 computer costs 1,234. The function iterates over possible numbers of houses that can be bought, calculating the remaining amount of money after purchasing those houses, and then checks how many cars can be bought with the remaining amount. If the remaining amount after buying houses and cars can be expressed as an exact multiple of the computer's cost, the function returns 'YES'. If no combination leads to this scenario, it concludes by returning 'NO'. The function does not consider cases where n is less than the cost of the cheapest item, failing to check direct impossibility for such amounts and only addresses combinations of items indirectly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
