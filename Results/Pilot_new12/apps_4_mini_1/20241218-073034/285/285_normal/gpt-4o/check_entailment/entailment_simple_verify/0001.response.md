Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Kolya can spend all his initial game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. The nested loops effectively explore all combinations of possible purchases, and the conditions ensure that the remaining coins can be allocated appropriately.

The annotations support this conclusion, confirming that:
- The state of the variables within the function aligns with the mechanisms used to calculate if the total coins can be fully spent on the available items.
- The logic of iterating through possible numbers of houses and cars, followed by checking if the remaining coins can be spent on computers, matches the problem requirements.
- The output "YES" or "NO" is definitively determined by the condition checks in the loop structure.

The thorough iteration across the valid ranges and the checks for divisibility with respect to the cost of a computer ensure that all cases that meet the conditions of the problem are considered. Hence, the program meets the problem description, and the assessment is substantiated by the program's design and the annotations provided.
