The program is intended to determine whether Kolya can exactly spend his initial game-coin score \( n \) on a combination of houses, cars, and computers given their respective costs. The costs are fixed: one house is \( 1,234,567 \) game-coins, one car is \( 123,456 \) game-coins, and one computer is \( 1,234 \) game-coins.

The function `func_1` correctly iterates over possible numbers of houses that can be bought. For each number of houses, it calculates the remaining amount of money after purchasing those houses and then iteratively checks how many cars can be bought with that remaining amount. For each combination of houses and cars, it checks if the remaining amount can be expressed as an exact multiple of the computer's cost.

However, the output hints highlight a critical issue. The program does not accommodate cases where \( n \) is less than the cost of the cheapest item (the computer), which is \( 1,234 \). In such cases, it's impossible to spend exactly \( n \) on any combination of items, and the function should immediately return 'NO' for those inputs.

The program would incorrectly fail to handle inputs such as \( n = 1,000 \) (which is less than \( 1,234 \)), leading to an incorrect output since it does not check this direct impossibility first.

Because of this oversight, we can conclude that the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
