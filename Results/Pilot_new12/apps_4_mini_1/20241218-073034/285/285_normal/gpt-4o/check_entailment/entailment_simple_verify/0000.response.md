The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the program's logic and the problem description. The program effectively calculates whether Kolya can exactly spend his initial game-coin score on houses, cars, and computers based on their given costs. The nested loops check all combinations of purchasing houses and cars, and the check for remaining coins being divisible by the cost of a computer ensures that no coins are left unspent.

The state annotations are consistent with these operations, clarifying the variables and their limits during execution. The description of the states confirms that the program handles the inputs as specified and adheres to the described functionality, indicating it should correctly return "YES" or "NO" based on the feasibility of purchasing the items without any leftover coins.

Given this detailed breakdown, the original assessment of correctness as **True** is indeed accurate. The code meets the problem requirements and is logically sound based on the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
