Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to spend all of Kolya's initial game-coins on houses, cars, and computers based on their respective costs. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The outer loop iterates over the possible number of houses that can be bought (controlled by variable `a`). For each potential number of houses, it calculates the remaining game-coins after purchasing those houses.

2. The inner loop iterates over the possible number of cars that can be bought (controlled by variable `b`). For each potential purchase of cars, it calculates the remaining game-coins after purchasing the houses and cars.

3. The program then checks if the remaining game-coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (controlled by `computer_cost`). This check ensures that the remaining coins can be spent entirely on computers.

4. If it finds a valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it returns "YES", indicating that Kolya could have spent his coins correctly. If no combination works, it returns "NO".

The algorithm efficiently checks all possible combinations of houses and cars while ensuring that it finds if the remaining balance can be spent completely on computers. Given the constraints mentioned, it covers all potential edge cases correctly based on the problem description. 

Hence, the code is correct and behaves as expected for the given problem.
