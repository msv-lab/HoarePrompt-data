Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `n`, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score. This follows the input constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Cost Setup**: The program defines the costs for one house, car, and computer, which are 1,234,567, 123,456, and 1,234 game-coins respectively. These values are consistent with the problem description.

3. **Looping Over Houses**: The first for loop iterates over the possible number of houses (`a`), starting from 0 to `n // house_cost`, ensuring that the number of houses cannot exceed the maximum that can be bought with `n` coins.

4. **Remaining Calculation for Cars**: For each iteration of houses, the program calculates the remaining coins after accounting for the houses purchased. The second for loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`), calculating the remaining after purchasing cars.

5. **Checking for Computers**: Within the second loop, the program checks if the remaining amount of game-coins can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`). This check determines if the remaining coins can be used to buy non-negative integers of computers.

6. **Return Values**: If a valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` (number of houses, cars, and computers) exists such that the total spent equals `n`, the program returns 'YES'. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it returns 'NO'.

The program thus effectively checks all combinations of houses, cars, and computers and handles all cases within the constraints provided by the problem description. It guarantees that if there is a way to spend exactly `n` game-coins, it will find it, and if not, it correctly returns 'NO'.

Hence, the annotated program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality.
