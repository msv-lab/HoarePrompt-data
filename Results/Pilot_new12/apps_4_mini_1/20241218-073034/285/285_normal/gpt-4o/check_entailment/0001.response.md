Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya could have spent all of his game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1` iterates over the possible number of houses he could buy, calculates the remaining coins, and then iterates over the possible number of cars he could buy with the remaining coins. If, after buying a certain number of houses and cars, the remaining coins can be evenly divided by the computer cost, the program concludes that it is possible to spend exactly `n` coins.

Key points ensuring the correctness:
1. **Range of iterations**: It checks every possible number of houses and cars.
2. **Modulo operation**: It correctly checks if the remaining coins can be entirely spent on computers.
3. **Non-negative integer constraints**: The loops inherently handle only non-negative integers since they start from 0.

The program efficiently explores all possible combinations within the constraints provided by the problem (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), and there are no edge cases identified where it would fail based on the problem description.

Overall, it successfully meets the requirements for every potential case.
