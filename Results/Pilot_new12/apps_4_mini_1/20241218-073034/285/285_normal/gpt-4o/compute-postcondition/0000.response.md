The variable `house_cost` is assigned a specific value of `1234567`. The other variables present in the initial state (`n` being a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) remain unaffected as the code snippet modifies only `house_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567**
