Output State: **`n` is at least 2595590; `remaining_after_houses` is at least 267456 and non-negative; `b` is at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; if a suitable value of `b` exists, then `remaining_after_cars` can be expressed as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and there may or may not be a `b` such that `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`. If no such `b` exists, the program does not return 'YES'.**
