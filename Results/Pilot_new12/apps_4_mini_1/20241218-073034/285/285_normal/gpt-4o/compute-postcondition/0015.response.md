To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze what the assignment does to the variable `remaining_after_cars`.

1. The initial state gives the following values:
   - `n` is at least 1234567.
   - `house_cost` is 1234567.
   - `car_cost` is 123456.
   - `computer_cost` is 1234.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567.
   - `b` is 2.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is at least 1111111 and not divisible by 1234.

2. The code `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` updates `remaining_after_cars` based on the value of `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`.

3. Since `b` is 2 and `car_cost` is 123456, we calculate:
   - `b * car_cost` = 2 * 123456 = 246912.
   
4. Then we substitute this value into the equation:
   - `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 246912`.

Given that `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567, the minimum value of `remaining_after_cars` can be calculated as:
- If we assume `remaining_after_houses` = 1234567 (the minimum), then:
  - `remaining_after_cars = 1234567 - 246912 = 987655`.

Therefore, regardless of the specific value of `remaining_after_houses` (as long as it is at least 1234567), `remaining_after_cars` will always be equal to or exceed 987655 (noting that it must also remain at least 1111111 after this operation).

Since no other variables are affected in this code snippet, the final output state will include the updated value of `remaining_after_cars`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is at least 987655 and not divisible by 1234.**
