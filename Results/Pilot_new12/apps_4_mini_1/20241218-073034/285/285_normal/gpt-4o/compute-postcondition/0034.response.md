Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `b` is at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, and for some value of `b`, `remaining_after_cars` (which is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`) is not divisible by `computer_cost` for all iterations; if a suitable value of `b` exists that makes `remaining_after_cars` divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES', otherwise it does not return any value.**
