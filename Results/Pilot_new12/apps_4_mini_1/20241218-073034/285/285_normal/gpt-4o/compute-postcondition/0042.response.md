According to the code, the for loop will execute based on the condition given by `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. In order for the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least 267456.
- Since `b` is currently 0, for the next iteration, it will become 1.
- The upper bound for the loop is determined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the calculation must remain valid for `b = 1`.

Thus, the state should reflect:
- `b` is now 1.
- The condition for the loop still holds, meaning `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least 1 for `b` to be less than or equal to this value in the next iteration.

The variable `remaining_after_houses` must remain the same (at least 267456) and `remaining_after_cars` will also remain unchanged since it's equal to `remaining_after_houses`.

So, we need to state that `remaining_after_houses` must still be at least 267456 and adjust `b` accordingly. 

State: **`n` must be at least 2595590; `remaining_after_houses` is at least 267456; `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative; `b` is 1; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
