To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the for loop statement.

The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
```

The loop will execute as long as the lower bound of the `range` function evaluates to zero or more. We need to ensure that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is non-negative. 

Given our current state:
- `n` is at least 1234567
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0 (and calculated as `n - house_cost`)

Now let's analyze the variable `remaining_after_houses`:
- Since `house_cost` is 1234567 and `n` is at least 1234567, `remaining_after_houses` will always be at least 0, but it will specifically be 0 when n equals house_cost.

Calculating `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`:
- If `remaining_after_houses` is 0 (minimum case), then `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` will result in 0, thus `range(0 // car_cost + 1)` evaluates to `range(0 + 1)`, which results in `[0]`. This means the loop will execute exactly once.

Now, to ensure the loop can execute:
1. We can have `remaining_after_houses` being exactly 0 or any positive amount.
2. Since `car_cost` is 123456, for the loop to execute more than once, `remaining_after_houses` would need to be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.

Thus, the states we should specify to ensure the loop executes would be:
- `remaining_after_houses` must be at least 0, and it can be greater than or equal to `car_cost` to allow for multiple iterations, but it is not a strict requirement for execution.

The minimum adjustments for the loop to execute are that `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, and so `b` needs to start at 0. 

Therefore, the answer is:

State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `b` is 0**.
