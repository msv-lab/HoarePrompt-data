According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `remaining_after_houses` and how it relates to `car_cost`. The expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` determines how many times the loop can run. The last iteration would have been for `b` equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. 

Since we need to execute the loop one more time, `b` must be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `b` will be equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` now.

Consequently, we need `remaining_after_houses` to be sufficient to cover the cost of one more car. This implies that the value of `b` should be equivalent to the next available index in the range, which means `remaining_after_houses` itself needs to allow for at least this value.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` was some value that is currently valid within the loopâ€™s bounds. Thus for the loop to be executed one more time, `b` is updated to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, and `remaining_after_houses` must remain sufficient for `car_cost`.

State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be sufficient to allow one more iteration, b is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`**
