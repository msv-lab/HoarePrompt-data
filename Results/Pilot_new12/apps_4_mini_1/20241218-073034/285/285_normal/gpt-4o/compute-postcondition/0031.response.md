The value of `b` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, which indicates `b` is assigned the result of that calculation. After that, `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `remaining_after_houses` was sufficient to cover `b * car_cost`, the result for `remaining_after_cars` must be non-negative.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `remaining_after_cars`, while keeping `remaining_after_houses` and `b` as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be sufficient to allow one more iteration, `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
