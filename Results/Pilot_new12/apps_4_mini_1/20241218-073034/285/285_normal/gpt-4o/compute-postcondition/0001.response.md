The variable `car_cost` is assigned the static value of 123456. This does not depend on any previous variable; therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `house_cost` are still valid as they were initially, while `car_cost` is now specifically set to 123456.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456**
