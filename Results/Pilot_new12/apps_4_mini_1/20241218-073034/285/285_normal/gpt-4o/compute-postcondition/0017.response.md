Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567, `b` is 2, and `remaining_after_cars` is at least 987655 and not divisible by 1234. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no return value from this branch.***
