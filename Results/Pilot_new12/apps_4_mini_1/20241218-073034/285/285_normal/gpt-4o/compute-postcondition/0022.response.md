In the given code snippet, `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. To identify the impact:

- The variable `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged and is at least 0.
- The variable `b` has the value 0.
- The variable `car_cost` has the value 123456.

Now we can calculate:

- Since `b` is 0, the expression `b * car_cost` evaluates to `0 * 123456`, which is 0.
- Thus, `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - 0`, which effectively does not change the initial value of `remaining_after_houses`.

Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` will have the same value as `remaining_after_houses` after execution.

The output state will include all current variable states, indicating that `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses`, while the rest of the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
