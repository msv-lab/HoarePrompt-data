Output State: **`n` is at least `0`, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is at most `n // house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative and can be less than `car_cost`, `b` can be at most `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, for some values of `b`, `remaining_after_cars` can either be divisible by `computer_cost` or not, determining if the program returns 'YES' or remains without a return.**
