Output State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 1234567, `b` is the maximum value that satisfies `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is at least 0. If any value of `remaining_after_cars` during the loop execution is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns 'YES'; otherwise, it does not return a value.**
