The `break` statement is executed, which will terminate the nearest enclosing loop or if statement without altering the values of the variables. The state of `s`, `f`, `ind`, `bind`, and `i` remains unchanged, and we simply note that we broke out of the loop.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True; `ind` is -1; `bind` is equal to `n - 2`; `i` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
