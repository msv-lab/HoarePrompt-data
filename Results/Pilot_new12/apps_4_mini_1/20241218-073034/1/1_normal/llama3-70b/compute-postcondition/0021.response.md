Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0. If `s[i]` is '[', then `f` is set to True. If `s[i]` is ':', and `f` is True, `ind` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
