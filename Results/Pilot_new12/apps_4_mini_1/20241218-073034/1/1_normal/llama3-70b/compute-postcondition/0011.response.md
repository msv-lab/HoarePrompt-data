The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0, `ind` is 0, `f` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` is not '[', and the character at index `i` is ':' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
