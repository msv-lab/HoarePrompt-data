The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `f` remains as is, `ind` is `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
