Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True if there is at least one ']' before a ':'; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', or remains -1 if ']' never encountered or ':' exists before ']'; `ind` remains -1; if either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, the function continues without performing further actions. Otherwise, if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 is printed. If `ind` is less than `bind`, `f` is True, `bind` is correctly set to the index of the last ':' after the last ']', `ind` is less than `bind`, `ans` is initialized to 4 plus the count of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]`, and `ans` is printed.***
