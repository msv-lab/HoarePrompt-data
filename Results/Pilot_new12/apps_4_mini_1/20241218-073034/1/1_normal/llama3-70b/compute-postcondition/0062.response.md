The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console but does not modify any variables in the program. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True if there is at least one ']' before a ':'; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', or remains -1 if ']' never encountered or ':' exists before ']'; `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1. The current value of `ind` is greater than or equal to the current value of `bind`; -1 has been printed.**
