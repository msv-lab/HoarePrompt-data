The variable `ind` is assigned the value -1. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `n` remains the length of `s`, which is still between 1 and 500000. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`, and `ind` is -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is -1.**
