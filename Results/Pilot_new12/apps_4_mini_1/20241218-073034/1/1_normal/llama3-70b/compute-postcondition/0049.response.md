Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If the character at `s[n - 2]` is ']', then the state remains unchanged with `f` as True, `ind` as -1, `bind` as `n - 1`, and `i` as `n - 2`. Otherwise, if `s[n - 2]` is a colon (':') with `f` True, then `ind` remains -1, `bind` is set to `n - 2`, and `i` is also set to `n - 2`, thus causing the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
