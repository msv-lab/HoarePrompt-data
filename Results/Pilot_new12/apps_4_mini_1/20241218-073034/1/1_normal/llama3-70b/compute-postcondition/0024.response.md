The statement `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Since `i` is given to be `n` (which is greater than 0), `ind` will take the value of `n`. The other variables `s`, `f`, and `ind` remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the fact that `ind` now has the value of `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `f` remains as is, `ind` is `n`**
