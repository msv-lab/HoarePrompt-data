The value of `f` is assigned `True`. The other variables `s`, `ind`, `bind`, and `i` remain unchanged in this statement. Therefore, the output state includes all unchanged variables along with the updated value of `f`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True; `ind` is -1; `bind` is `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 2**
