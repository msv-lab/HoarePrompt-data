Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If `f` is True, `ind` remains -1, `bind` is set to `n - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `f` is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
