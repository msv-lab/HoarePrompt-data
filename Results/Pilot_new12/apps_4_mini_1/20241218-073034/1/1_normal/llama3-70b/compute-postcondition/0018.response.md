The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `i` will be the next index (`i + 1`); `ind` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
