Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ']', then `f` is True, and `ind`, `bind` remain -1 while `i` is `n - 1`. If the character is not ']', and it is ':', and if `f` is True, then `ind` remains -1, `bind` is set to `n - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `f` is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
