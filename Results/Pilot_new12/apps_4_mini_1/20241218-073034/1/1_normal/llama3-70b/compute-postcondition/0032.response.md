According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified. The loop executes as long as `i` is in the range from `n - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. The current state shows that `n` is greater than 0, which means `n - 1` will be a valid starting index for `i`. 

Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is not explicitly set. Therefore, it must start from `n - 1` (the last valid index of the string `s`) for the loop to execute. 

Furthermore, `f`, `ind`, and `bind` do not affect the loop execution directly. 

Thus, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is False; `ind` is -1; `bind` is -1; `i` is `n - 1`**
