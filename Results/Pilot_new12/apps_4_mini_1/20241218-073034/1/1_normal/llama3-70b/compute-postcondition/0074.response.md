Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', which is greater than `ind`; `ind` is a valid index (not -1) and is less than `bind`, and must be at most `bind - 3; `i` is `ind + 3`. If `s[i]` is '|', then `ans` has increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
