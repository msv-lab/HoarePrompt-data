The code snippet `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` but does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `s`, `f`, `bind`, and `ind` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True if there is at least one ']' before a ':'; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', or remains -1 if ']' never encountered or ':' exists before ']', and `ind` remains -1; either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1.**
