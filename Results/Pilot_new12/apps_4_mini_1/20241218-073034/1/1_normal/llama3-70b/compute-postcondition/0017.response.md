`ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which means that `ind` will take on the current value of `i`. The length of the string `s` remains valid as `n` is greater than 0, and there are no changes to `s` or any other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0; `i` will be the next index (i + 1); `ind` is equal to `i`.**
