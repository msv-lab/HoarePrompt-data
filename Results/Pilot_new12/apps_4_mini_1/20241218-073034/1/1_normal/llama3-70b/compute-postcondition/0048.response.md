Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If `s[n - 2]` is a colon (':') and `f` is True, then `ind` remains -1, `bind` is set to `n - 2`, and `i` is set to `n - 2`, causing the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code.***
