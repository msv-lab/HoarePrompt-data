Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `f` is True, `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', which is greater than `ind`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ans` is initialized to 4 plus the count of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]`, and `ans` is printed.***
