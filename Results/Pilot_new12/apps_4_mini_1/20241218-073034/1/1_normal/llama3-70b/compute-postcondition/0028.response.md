Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0. If `s[i]` is equal to '[', then `i` is `n`, `f` is True, and `ind` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is equal to ':', `i` remains as `n`, `f` remains unchanged, and `ind` is set to `n`. If `f` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
