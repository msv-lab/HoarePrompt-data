Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If `s[i]` is `']'`, then `f` remains True, `ind` is -1, `bind` is unchanged at `n - 2`, and `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i]` is `':'` and `f` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `ind` remaining -1, `bind` unchanged at `n - 2`, and `i` is `n - 3.***
