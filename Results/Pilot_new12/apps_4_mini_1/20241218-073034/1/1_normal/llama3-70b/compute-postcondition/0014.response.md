Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0; if the character at index `i` is '[', then `f` is set to True; otherwise, if the character at index `i` is ':' and `f` is True, `ind` is set to 0, `f` remains True, `i` is 0, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
