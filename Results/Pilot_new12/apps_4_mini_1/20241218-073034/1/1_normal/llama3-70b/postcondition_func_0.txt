The function reads a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters along with the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|` from input, and analyzes its structure to check for specific patterns. It determines the positions of the first `:` after the last `[`, and the last `:` before the first `]`. If either of these characters is absent in the expected order, it prints `-1`. If the first `:` appears after the last `[`, it counts the occurrences of `|` between these two characters, adds 4 to that count, and prints the result. If there are no valid `:` characters in the required positions, or if the positions are invalid (first `:` not after last `[`), the function will print `-1`. This function essentially checks for the proper structure between brackets and colons, and performs an arithmetic operation based on the occurrences of the `|` character.
