You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                ind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` that is greater than 0; if `s` contains at least one '[', `f` is True, and `ind` is the index of the first ':' after the last '[' (or remains -1 if no ':' follows); otherwise, if there is no '[', `f` is False, and `ind` is -1.
    bind = -1
    f = False
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            f = True
        elif s[i] == ':':
            if f:
                bind = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True if there is at least one ']' before a ':'; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', or remains -1 if ']' never encountered or ':' exists before ']'; `ind` remains -1.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        if (ind >= bind) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            ans = 4
            for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    ans += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', which is greater than `ind`; `ind` is a valid index (not -1) and is less than `bind`, which can go up to `bind - 1`; `ans` is the initial value of 4 plus the count of '|' characters found in `s[ind + 1:bind]`.
            print(ans)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `f` is True, `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', which is greater than `ind`, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ans` is initialized to 4 plus the count of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]`, and `ans` is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length `n` greater than 0; `f` is True if there is at least one ']' before a ':'; `bind` is the index of the last ':' after the last ']', or remains -1 if ']' never encountered or ':' exists before ']'; `ind` remains -1; if either `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, the function continues without performing further actions. Otherwise, if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, -1 is printed. If `ind` is less than `bind`, `f` is True, `bind` is correctly set to the index of the last ':' after the last ']', `ind` is less than `bind`, `ans` is initialized to 4 plus the count of '|' characters found in the substring `s[ind + 1:bind]`, and `ans` is printed.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
