The function processes a given string `s` that may contain lowercase Latin letters as well as the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It identifies the first occurrence of `[` and the last occurrence of `]` in the string. If either of those characters is not found, or if the first `[` appears at or after the last `]`, the function outputs `-1`. If both occurrences are found, the function then locates the first `:` after the first `[` and the first `:` before the last `]`. If either of these colons cannot be found, or if the first `:` is not located before the last `:`, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, the function counts the number of `|` characters found between these two colons and computes a result as `4 + pipe_count`, which it then prints. The output is `-1` in various error conditions and a positive integer in successful cases, specifically indicating the presence of colons and pipes in the defined range of the string.
