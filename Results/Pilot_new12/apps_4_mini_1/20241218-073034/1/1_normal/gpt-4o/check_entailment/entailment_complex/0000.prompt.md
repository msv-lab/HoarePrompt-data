You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.


-----Examples-----
Input
|[a:b:|]

Output
4

Input
|]:[|:]

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ind = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '[':
            ind = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is the length of `s`, which is between 1 and 500,000; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |.
    bind = -1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == ']':
            bind = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, or -1 if ']' does not exist in `s`; `i` is -1 after the loop's termination if no ']' is found, or an index >= 0 corresponding to the last checked element before the loop broke.
    if (ind == -1 or bind == -1 or ind >= bind) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        start_colon = -1
        for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
            if s[i] == ':':
                start_colon = i
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `i` is `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 (if no ':' found between `ind + 1` and `bind`) or the index of the first occurrence of ':' found after `ind`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, and `ind` is less than `bind`.
        end_colon = -1
        for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
            if s[i] == ':':
                end_colon = i
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `end_colon` is either -1 (if no ':' was found in the evaluated range) or the index of the first occurrence of ':' found while iterating from `bind - 1` to `ind`.
        if (start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            pipe_count = 0
            for i in range(start_colon + 1, end_colon):
                if s[i] == '|':
                    pipe_count += 1
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`, `start_colon` is not equal to -1, `end_colon` is not equal to -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `pipe_count` is equal to the number of occurrences of '|' between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon - 1`, and `i` is equal to `end_colon`.
            result = 4 + pipe_count
            print(result)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000. If `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, -1 is printed to the output. Otherwise, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`, `start_colon` is not equal to -1, `end_colon` is not equal to -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`; `pipe_count` is the number of occurrences of '|' between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon - 1`, `i` is set to `end_colon`, `result` is computed as `4 + pipe_count`, and the value of `result` is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If either `ind` or `bind` is -1, or `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, then none of the conditions for processing `s` are met. Otherwise, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, and `n` is between 1 and 500,000. If `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, -1 is printed. If `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`, `start_colon` is not -1, `end_colon` is not -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, then `pipe_count` is set to the number of occurrences of '|' between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon - 1`, `i` is set to `end_colon`, `result` is computed as `4 + pipe_count`, and the calculated `result` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a given string `s` that may contain lowercase Latin letters as well as the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It identifies the first occurrence of `[` and the last occurrence of `]` in the string. If either of those characters is not found, or if the first `[` appears at or after the last `]`, the function outputs `-1`. If both occurrences are found, the function then locates the first `:` after the first `[` and the first `:` before the last `]`. If either of these colons cannot be found, or if the first `:` is not located before the last `:`, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, the function counts the number of `|` characters found between these two colons and computes a result as `4 + pipe_count`, which it then prints. The output is `-1` in various error conditions and a positive integer in successful cases, specifically indicating the presence of colons and pipes in the defined range of the string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
