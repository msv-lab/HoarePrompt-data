The value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is 1; `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
