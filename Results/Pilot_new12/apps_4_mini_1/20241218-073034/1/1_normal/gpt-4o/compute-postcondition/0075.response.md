Postcondition: ***`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 2`, `start_colon` is not equal to -1, `end_colon` is not equal to -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`. If `s[i]` is '|', then `pipe_count` is increased by at least 1, maintaining the previous conditions.***
