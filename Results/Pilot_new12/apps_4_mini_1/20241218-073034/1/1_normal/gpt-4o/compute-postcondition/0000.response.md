The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts a string from the user that consists of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500,000. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000.**
