The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value `-1`. Since no other variables are impacted by this assignment, we retain all other information regarding the variables stated in the initial condition.

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, or -1 if ']' does not exist in `s`; `i` is an index >= 0 corresponding to the last checked element before the loop broke; and it holds that both `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1, and `ind` is less than `bind`; `start_colon` is -1.**
