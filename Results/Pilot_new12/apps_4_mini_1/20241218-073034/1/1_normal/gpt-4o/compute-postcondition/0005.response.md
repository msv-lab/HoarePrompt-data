The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `ind`. The variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected, so we keep their previous states. The value of `ind` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s` which must be at least 1; `ind` is 0; `i` is 0.**
