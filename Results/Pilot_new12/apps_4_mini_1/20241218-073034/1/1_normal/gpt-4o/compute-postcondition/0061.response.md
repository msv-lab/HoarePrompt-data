In the provided code, `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is determined by the expression `bind - 3`, and since `bind` is given to be greater than `ind + 1`, the relationship holds that `i` will also be valid under the given constraints.

At this point, the values of the affected variables are updated accordingly:

- `i` remains defined as `bind - 3`
- `end_colon` is now equal to `bind - 3`

The other variables (`ind`, `bind`, and `n`) remain unchanged in the output state.

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `i` is `bind - 3`, `end_colon` is `bind - 3`**
