Initial State: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `i` is `ind + 3`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `start_colon` is set to `ind + 1`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3`

The assignment `start_colon = i` results in `start_colon` being set to the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `ind + 3`, we can express `start_colon` in terms of `ind` as well.

Thus:
- `start_colon` becomes `ind + 3`.

The other variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `i` is `ind + 3`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `start_colon` is `ind + 3`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3`.**
