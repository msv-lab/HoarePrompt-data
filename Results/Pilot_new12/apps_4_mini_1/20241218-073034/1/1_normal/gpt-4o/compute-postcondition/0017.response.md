The value of `bind` is directly assigned -1. The variable `bind` did not exist before this assignment, but `ind` retains its previous value (the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1) and `n` will still represent the length of `s`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `bind` is now -1, while the states of `ind` and `n` are preserved.

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is the length of `s`, which is between 1 and 500,000; `bind` is -1.**
