Postcondition: ***`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '['; `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `end_colon` is either -1 (if no ':' was found in the evaluated range) or the index of the first occurrence of ':' found while iterating from `bind - 1` to `ind`. The value of `start_colon` is -1, the value of `end_colon` is -1, or the value of `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`.***
