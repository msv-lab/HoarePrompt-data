The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `bind` is `n - 3`; `i` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
