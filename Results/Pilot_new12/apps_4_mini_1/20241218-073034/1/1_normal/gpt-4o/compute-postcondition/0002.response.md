The variable `ind` is assigned the value of -1. The other variables remain unaffected by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new value of `ind`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`, which is a value between 1 and 500,000; `ind` is -1**
