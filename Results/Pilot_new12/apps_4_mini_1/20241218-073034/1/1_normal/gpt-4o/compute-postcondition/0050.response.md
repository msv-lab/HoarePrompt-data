The code assigns the value of `-1` to `end_colon`. This value is a constant and does not depend on other variables, meaning `end_colon` is now explicitly set to `-1`. The states of other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `i` is `bind`, `start_colon` is either -1 or the index of the first occurrence of ':', `end_colon` is -1.**
