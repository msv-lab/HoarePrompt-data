The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is `bind - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
