According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 2**
