Postcondition: ***`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000. If `start_colon` is -1, `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, -1 is printed to the output. Otherwise, `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`, `start_colon` is not equal to -1, `end_colon` is not equal to -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`; `pipe_count` is the number of occurrences of '|' between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon - 1`, `i` is set to `end_colon`, `result` is computed as `4 + pipe_count`, and the value of `result` is printed.***
