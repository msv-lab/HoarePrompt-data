The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '['; `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `i` is `bind - 1`; and `end_colon` is `bind - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
