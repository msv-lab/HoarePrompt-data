According to the code, the for loop iterates from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `ind + 1` must be less than `bind`. Given that `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1, it already holds that `ind` is less than `bind`. 

However, we need to ensure the indices are set properly for the loop to run. Since `i` is the index that corresponds to the last checked element before the loop broke, and the loop starts from `ind + 1`, we also need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `ind + 1` to reflect the starting position in the loop.

Therefore, the necessary states should be:

State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `i` is `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `start_colon` is -1, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, and `ind` is less than `bind`**
