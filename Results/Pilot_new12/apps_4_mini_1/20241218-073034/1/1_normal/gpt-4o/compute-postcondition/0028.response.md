In the given code, `bind` is assigned the value of `i`. The variable `i` has the value of `n - 3`. Subsequently, `bind` will take that value, which means `bind` will now be equal to `n - 3`. The other variables `ind` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `bind` is `n - 3`; `i` is `n - 3`.**
