Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |. `n` is the length of `s` which must be at least 1. If the first character of `s` at index `i` (which is 0) is '[', then `ind` is updated to 0, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
