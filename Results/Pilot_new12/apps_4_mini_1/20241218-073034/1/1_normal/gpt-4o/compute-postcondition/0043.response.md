The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']', `i` is `ind + 2`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `start_colon` is `ind + 2`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
