Postcondition: ***`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[' in `s`, or -1 if '[' does not exist in `s`; `n` is between 1 and 500,000; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, or -1 if ']' does not exist in `s`; `i` is -1 after the loop's termination if no ']' is found, or an index >= 0 corresponding to the last checked element before the loop broke. The current value of `ind` is -1 or the current value of `bind` is -1 or the current value of `ind` is greater than or equal to the current value of `bind`.***
