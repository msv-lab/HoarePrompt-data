Postcondition: ***`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `end_colon` is the index of the first occurrence of ':' found while iterating from `bind - 1` to `ind`, `start_colon` is not equal to -1, `end_colon` is not equal to -1, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, and if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '|', then `pipe_count` is updated to 1 and `i` is `start_colon + 1`. Otherwise, `pipe_count` remains unchanged.***
