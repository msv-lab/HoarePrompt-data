The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently defined as `bind - 2`. Therefore, `end_colon` will take on the specific value of `bind - 2`. The values of `ind`, `bind`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged apart from the new value assigned to `end_colon`. 

Output State: **`ind` is the index of the first occurrence of '[', `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `n` is between 1 and 500,000, `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`.**
