The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s` which must be at least 1; `ind` is 0; `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
