The dictionary `d` is initially empty. The line `d[i] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. However, since `d` is empty, there is no value at the key `i`, which would result in a KeyError in actual Python execution. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this simulation and following your guidelines, we will mention that `d[i]` is being updated without causing an error.

The only variable affected by the code is the dictionary `d`, which will have a new entry for the key `i`. Since `d[i]` does not exist initially, we can assume a default initialization where `d[i]` is set to `0` before the increment.

Therefore, after the increment, `d[i]` will equal `1`.

The other variable values remain unchanged, and the output should reflect these updates.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `i` takes the first value from `a`; `d` is a dictionary with `d[i] = 1`.**
