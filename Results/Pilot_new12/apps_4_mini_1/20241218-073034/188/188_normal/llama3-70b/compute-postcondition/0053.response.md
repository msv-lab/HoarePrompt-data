The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string `'YES'`. However, no variables are assigned or modified in this snippet. The state of all variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `c` is 0 or 1; `a1` is a key in `d` satisfying `d[i] == n // 2;` `a2` is a key in `d` satisfying `d[i] == n // 2;` the current value of `a1` is not -1 and the current value of `a2` is not -1.**
