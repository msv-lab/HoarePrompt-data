The code increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `d` has at least 1 key, and `c` remains unchanged. The values of `a1` and `a2` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `c`, which is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; `c` is incremented by 1; `a1` is assigned the value of `i`; `a2` is the next key in `d`.**
