Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; if `d[i]` equals `n // 2` and `c` is 0, then `c` is incremented by 1, `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `a2` is the next key in `d`. If `c` is not zero, `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is adjusted based on the last value of `c`, and `a2` is equal to `i`, leading to a break in the most internal loop or if statement. `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`, and `a2` is equal to `i`.***
