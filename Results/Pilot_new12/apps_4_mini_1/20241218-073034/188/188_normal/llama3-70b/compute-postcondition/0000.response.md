`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means that `n` will now hold the integer value that is inputted, subject to the condition that it must still be an even integer in the range [2, 100]. The list of numbers on the cards remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `n` is an input integer.**
