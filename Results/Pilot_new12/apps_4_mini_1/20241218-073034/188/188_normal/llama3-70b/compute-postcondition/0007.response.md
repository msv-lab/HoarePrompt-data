In this case, `a` is a list that originally contains the value of `n` plus a user input integer. The code appends a new integer to the list `a` that is obtained by converting a user input value into an integer. This means `a` will now contain all its previous values plus the new integer value from the user input.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an even integer in the specified range, and the initial value of `i` also stays the same. The variable `a` will now include this new integer from the user input along with the original integer `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the original integer plus the user input integer that has been appended.**
