The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after the execution, `c` will be 1. The values of the other variables are not affected, and they retain their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; `c` is 1; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is the next key in `d`.**
