The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer obtained from user input to the list `a`. The variable `n` remains as an even integer in the range [2, 100], and `i` remains 0. The list `a` will now contain one element, which is the integer input provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the original values while updating `a` to include the new input value. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the input integer.**
