The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The variable `i` was previously assigned a key of `d`, and since `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `i` retains that value. The other variables remain unchanged aside from the update to `a2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 1 key; `c` is not equal to 0; `a1` is -1; `a2` is equal to `i`; `i` has been assigned a key of `d` and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2.**
