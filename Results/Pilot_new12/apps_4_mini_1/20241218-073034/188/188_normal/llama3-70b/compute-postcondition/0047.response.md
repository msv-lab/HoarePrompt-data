The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state does not provide a value for `i`, but `a2` is now equal to whatever the value of `i` is. The values of `n`, `d`, `c`, and `a1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; `c` is 0 (or remains unchanged); `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; `c` is 0 (or remains unchanged); `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is equal to `i`.**
