Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; if `c` is 0, then `c` is now 1; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is -1; `i` is a key of `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `c` remains unchanged; `a1` is -1; `a2` is equal to `i`; `i` has been assigned a key of `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
