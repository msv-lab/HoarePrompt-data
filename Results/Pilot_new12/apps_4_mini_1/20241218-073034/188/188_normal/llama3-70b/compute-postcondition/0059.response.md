Functionality: **The function reads an even integer `n` from user input, which specifies the number of subsequent integers to read. It then takes `n` integers as input and counts the occurrences of each integer. The function checks if there are exactly two distinct integers in the list that each appear exactly `n / 2` times. If such integers are found, it prints "YES" followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function handles the case where no integers meet the criteria or where input does not conform to expected constraints, ensuring proper handling of counts and lists.**
