The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `i` has been assigned a key of `d`, meaning `i` refers to a valid key in the dictionary `d`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still a key in `d`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 1 key; `c` is 0; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is -1; `i` is a key of `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 1 key; `c` is 0; `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is -1; `i` is a key of `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.**
