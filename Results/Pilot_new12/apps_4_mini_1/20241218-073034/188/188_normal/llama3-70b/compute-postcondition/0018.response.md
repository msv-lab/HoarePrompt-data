The statement `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d` is expected to have key-value pairs updated based on the value of `i`, it is affected. The variable `n` remains unaffected and is still an even integer in the range [2, 100]. The variable `i` is also unchanged, remaining the second integer from the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is the second integer from the list `a`, `d` has the key-value pair `d[i] = 1`.**
