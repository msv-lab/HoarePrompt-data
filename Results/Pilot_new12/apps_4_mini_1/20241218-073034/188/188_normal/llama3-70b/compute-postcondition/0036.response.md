Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key. If `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2` and `c` is 0, then `c` is now 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, and `a2` is -1. If `c` is not equal to 0, then `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`. In both cases, `i` is a key of `d`, and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.***
