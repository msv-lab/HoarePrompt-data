To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the given information step by step:

1. The variable `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]. This means `n` can take values such as 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 100.

2. The dictionary `d` has at least 1 key, meaning it contains data which will be iterated over using the `for i in d:` loop.

3. The logic of the loop depends on the keys of `d`. Even if `c` was incremented in the previous iteration (if `c` became 1), it does not affect the ability of the loop to continue, as long as there is at least one more key to iterate over.

4. Since `i` is the loop variable that takes on each key of `d`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to advance to the next key in `d`. 

5. If `c` is not zero during the last iteration of the loop, we may need to adjust `a1` based on the last value of `c`, potentially affecting the context of whatever follows in the program.

Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `d` has at least one more key after the current iteration has completed.

Now we can summarize the adjustments: 
- `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop's immediate execution.
- `d` must have one more key after the current key.
- `c` remains unchanged or can still be incremented based on logic.
- `i` should be adjusted to reflect the next key in the dictionary.

Thus, the final state should reflect this:

State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; `c` is 0 (or remains unchanged); `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is the next key in `d`.**
