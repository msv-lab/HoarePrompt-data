The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `a2` takes on the value of `i`, the previous values of `n`, `d`, `c`, and `a1` are unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the new assignment made to `a2`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; `c` remains unchanged; `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is equal to `i`.**
