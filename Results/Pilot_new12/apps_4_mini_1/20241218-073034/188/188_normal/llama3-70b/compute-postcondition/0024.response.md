To determine the output state after the loop executes, we analyze how the loop affects the variables involved. The loop iterates over every integer in the list `a`, updating the dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each integer.

Since `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], the list `a` contains exactly `n` integers. After the loop executes all iterations:

- Each integer from `a` will have been processed exactly once.
- For each unique integer in `a`, the dictionary `d` will have an entry where the key is the integer itself and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
- If all integers in `a` are unique, each will appear once in `d`. If there are duplicates, their count will be reflected in the corresponding value in `d`.

In summary, the final output state reflects that `d` contains the frequency of each integer present in `a` after processing all elements. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `d` is a dictionary mapping each integer from `a` to its count of occurrences, and `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user.**
