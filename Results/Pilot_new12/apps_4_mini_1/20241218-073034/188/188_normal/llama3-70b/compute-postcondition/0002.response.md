According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be an even integer in the range [2, 100], it satisfies the condition for at least 1 iteration of the loop, which will occur from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. 

At the start of the loop, `i` needs to be initialized to 0, and since `a` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution but will be filled during the iterations.

Thus, to summarize the states before the loop starts:

State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is 0, and `a` is an empty list**
