Since the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot ascertain its value. As a result, while `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, its specific value remains unknown. Therefore, we can only state that the value of `a1` has been updated based on the value of `i`, which is currently undefined.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; `c` remains unchanged; `a1` is assigned the value of `i` (which is undefined); `a2` is the next key in `d`.**
