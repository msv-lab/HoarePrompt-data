To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, we consider that the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. During each iteration, an integer input is appended to the list `a`. 

Therefore, after all iterations:
- The variable `i` will take on the value of `n - 1`, as it starts at 0 and ends at `n - 1`.
- The list `a` will contain `n` input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers input by the user.**
