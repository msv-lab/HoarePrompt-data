The code `print(a1, a2)` outputs the values of `a1` and `a2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]
- `c` is 0 or 1
- `a1` is a key in `d` such that `d[i] == n // 2`
- `a2` is a key in `d` such that `d[i] == n // 2`
- the current value of `a1` is not -1 
- the current value of `a2` is not -1 

Since the code does not alter any variables but only prints them, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `c` is 0 or 1; `a1` is a key in `d` satisfying `d[i] == n // 2;`; `a2` is a key in `d` satisfying `d[i] == n // 2;`; the current value of `a1` is not -1; the current value of `a2` is not -1; `a1` and `a2` are printed.**
