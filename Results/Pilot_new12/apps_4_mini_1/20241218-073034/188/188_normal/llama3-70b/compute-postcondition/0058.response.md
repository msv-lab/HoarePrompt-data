The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer in the range [2, 100]. In addition, the function expects `n` integers, each within the range [1, 100], which represent the numbers on the n cards. While the exact output behavior isn't specified, it is implied that the function will process these inputs in some way. 

Since there are no specific cases or return values detailed in the output description, I can only summarize the input characteristics. Thus, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` within the range [2, 100] along with `n` integers that represent card numbers, each in the range [1, 100].

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (an even integer between 2 and 100) and n integers (each between 1 and 100) that represent numbers on cards.**
