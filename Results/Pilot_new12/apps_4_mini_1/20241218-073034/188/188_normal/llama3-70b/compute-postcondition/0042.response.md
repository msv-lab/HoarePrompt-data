Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; if `c` is 0, then `c` is incremented by 1, `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, and `a2` is the next key in `d`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`, and `a2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
