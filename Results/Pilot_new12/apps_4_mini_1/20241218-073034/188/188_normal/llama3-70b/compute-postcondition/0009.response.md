The statement `d = {}` initializes `d` as an empty dictionary. It does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables while indicating that `d` is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers input by the user, `d` is an empty dictionary**.
