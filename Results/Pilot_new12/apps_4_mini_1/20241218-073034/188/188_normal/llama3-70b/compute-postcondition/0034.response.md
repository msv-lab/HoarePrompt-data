The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 1 key; `c` is not equal to 0; `a1` is -1; `a2` is equal to `i`; `i` has been assigned a key of `d` and the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
