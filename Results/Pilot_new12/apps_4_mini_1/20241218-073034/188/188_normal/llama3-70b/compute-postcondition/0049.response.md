Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; if `c` is initially 0, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, and `a2` is the next key in `d`. If `c` is not zero, `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`, and `a2` is equal to `i`, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
