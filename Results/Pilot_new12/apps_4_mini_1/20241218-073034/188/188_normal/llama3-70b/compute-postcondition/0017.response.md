The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is in the range [2, 100] and not directly affected by this line of code. The variable `i` holds the value of the second integer from the list `a`, and the dictionary `d` has its key corresponding to `i` updated. The total state of the other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is the second integer from the list `a`, `d[i]` is updated by adding 1.**
