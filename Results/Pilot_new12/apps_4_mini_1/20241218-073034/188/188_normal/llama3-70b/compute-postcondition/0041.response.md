The value of the variables does not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; `c` remains unchanged; `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
