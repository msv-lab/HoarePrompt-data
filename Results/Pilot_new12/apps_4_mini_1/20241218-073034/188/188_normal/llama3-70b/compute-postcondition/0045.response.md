Initial State: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; `c` is 0 (or remains unchanged); `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is the next key in `d`.

The line of code `a1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `a1`. However, the initial state does not specify what value `i` holds, hence `a1` can take on the value of `i`, whatever that might be. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` must have at least 2 keys; `c` is 0 (or remains unchanged); `a1` is equal to `i`; `a2` is the next key in `d`.**
