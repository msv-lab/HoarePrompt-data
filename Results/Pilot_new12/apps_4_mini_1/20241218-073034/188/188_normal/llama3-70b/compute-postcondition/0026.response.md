The variables `a1` and `a2` are both assigned the value of `-1`. Consequently, there are no changes made to `n`, `d`, `c`, or `a`, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new values of `a1` and `a2` along with the unchanged preconditions.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` is a dictionary mapping each integer from `a` to its count of occurrences; `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user; `c` is 0; `a1` is -1; `a2` is -1**
