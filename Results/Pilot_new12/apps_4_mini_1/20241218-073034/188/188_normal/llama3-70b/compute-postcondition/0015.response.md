Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` takes the first value from `a`, which is a list containing at least 2 integers. If `i` is in the dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated to include `d[i] = 1`. Otherwise, after executing the else part, `d` will have a key `i` with a value of 1, and `i` will no longer be a key in `d`.***
