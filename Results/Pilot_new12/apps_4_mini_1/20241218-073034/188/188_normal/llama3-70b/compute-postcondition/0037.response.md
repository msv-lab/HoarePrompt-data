According to the code, the loop iterate over the keys in dictionary `d`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` was a key in `d` and that the current value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next key in `d`.

Given that `i` was a key in `d`, it means there are more keys to iterate over, and since `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], it will remain unchanged. Since `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition met, and the key `i` is updated, for the loop to execute once more, `i` will now represent the next key in the dictionary `d`.

State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `d` has at least 1 key; `c` remains unchanged; `a1` is appropriately adjusted based on the last value of `c`; `a2` is the next key in `d`.**
