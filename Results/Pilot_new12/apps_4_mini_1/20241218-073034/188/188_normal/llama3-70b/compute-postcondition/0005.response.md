The variable `a` is modified by the `append` method, which adds an integer value obtained from user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer within the range [2, 100], `i` is 1, and `a` contains this even integer. Therefore, after executing the code, `a` will contain the original integer plus the new integer that was input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing the original integer plus the user input integer.**
