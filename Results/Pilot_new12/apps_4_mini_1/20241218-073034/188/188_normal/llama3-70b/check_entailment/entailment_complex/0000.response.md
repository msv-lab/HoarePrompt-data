The provided program aims to determine if two players, Petya and Vasya, can choose different integers such that they can both take an equal number of cards from a given set of cards, ensuring that all cards are taken.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an even integer `n` (the number of cards) and then reads `n` integers representing the values on the cards.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses a dictionary `d` to count how many times each integer appears among the `n` cards.

3. **Finding Candidates**: The program then checks for integers in the dictionary `d` that appear exactly `n / 2` times. It looks for exactly two distinct integers (letâ€™s call them `a1` and `a2`) that meet this condition.

4. **Output Decision**: If two such integers are found, it prints "YES" and the two integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation of Correctness:

According to the problem description, the game is fair if:
- Petya and Vasya can take all `n` cards.
- The two chosen numbers must be distinct.
- Each player must take exactly `n / 2` cards.

### Program's Compliance with the Problem Description:

- **Even Count Checking**: The input assures that `n` is even, which aligns with the problem description.
  
- **Occurrence Check**: The program checks if there are precisely two distinct integers, each occurring `n / 2` times. 
  - If only one unique card exists with `n` occurrences or if all unique integers do not provide two distinct integers with `n / 2` occurrences, the function correctly outputs "NO", adhering to the game fairness condition.

- **Correct Output**: The program constructs its logic to print "YES" with two integers when the conditions are met, or "NO" otherwise, fitting the required output format.

### Edge Cases Covered:

- If all integers on the cards are the same (e.g., `6, 6`), it outputs "NO" since the integers chosen cannot be distinct.
  
- If there are more than two distinct numbers but none occurs exactly `n / 2` times (e.g., `10, 20, 30, 20, 10, 20`), it also correctly outputs "NO".

In summary, the program correctly identifies whether two distinct integers can be chosen such that both players can take an equal share of the cards, and it handles distinct cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The program meets all the requirements of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **True**
