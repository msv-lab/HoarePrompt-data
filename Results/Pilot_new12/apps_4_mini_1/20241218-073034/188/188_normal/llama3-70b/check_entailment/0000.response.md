To evaluate the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, let's analyze its functionality and consider potential edge cases that it may not handle correctly.

The problem requires determining if two distinct integers can be chosen so that both players can take all the cards, and each player ends up with an equal number of cards. 

### Analysis of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program collects the number of cards `n` and then fills up a list `a` with the numbers written on the cards. This part appears to be working as intended.

2. **Count Occurrences**: It counts how many times each number appears on the cards using a dictionary `d`. This is also functional and necessary for the next steps.

3. **Checking Fairness**:
   - It looks for two distinct integers whose counts are exactly `n // 2`, meaning both numbers should have the same count of cards.
   - The code maintains a count variable `c` to track how many numbers have been found with this exact count.

4. **Output Results**:
   - If two such distinct integers are found, it prints "YES" and the integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases Not Handled Correctly:
- **Edge Case for All Cards Being the Same**: The program does not specifically check if `n` cards are identical before counting, however, it naturally falls under the check where it can't find two distinct integers if there are none.
- **Counts Greater than n//2**: If there's a card number that appears more than `n//2`, it won't affect fairness, but they still need two distinct numbers. If `n` equals 2 and both cards are the same (for example, `[6, 6]`), it prints "NO" correctly but the reasoning is a bit convoluted. There's also a risk of misinterpreting counts.
- **Any case where two distinct integers don't both meet the requirement**: The logic assumes that if numbers exist in the required count, the game can always be fair. However, we could have a case where it outputs "NO" when it should not (failing to find two proper pairs).

### Example of a Failing Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  4
  1
  1
  2
  3
  ```
  Here, there are two '1's but we don't have any pairs of a count that is equal to `n // 2` (which is 2).

After analyzing the code logic and potential failing edge cases:
The program does not correctly account for all required scenarios, particularly when handling counts that do not yield two distinct integers with the required counts.

Correctness: **False**.
