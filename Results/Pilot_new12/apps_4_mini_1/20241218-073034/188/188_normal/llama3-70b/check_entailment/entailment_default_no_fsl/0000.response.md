Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. 

The main issue is that the program only checks for two distinct integers that each appear exactly `n / 2` times in the input list. While this can yield a fair game if such integers exist, it fails to account for other configurations where distinct integers can exist but not meet the count requirement. For example:

1. If the input cards contain more than two distinct values, or if the number of one of the integers leads to an imbalance in the distribution, the program will incorrectly return "NO".

2. In the input where integers are not distributed in such a way that they can split the cards evenly (such as having three unique integers or an unequal distribution, but all integers are distinct), the program will output "NO" even if there might be a valid configuration. 

For example, consider this case:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
Here, there are two distinct integers (1 and 2), each appearing exactly twice. The output from the program is "YES" and it should print "1 2". 

However, for the input:
```
4
1
1
1
2
```
This configuration is not handled correctly as it could produce an uneven distribution but still has two distinct numbers.

Furthermore, the code does not check if there are indeed just one card with majority or even distribution checks for other key patterns leading to more combinations.

Due to these deficiencies and the failure to account for various distributions of integers as well as not correctly interpreting the number of distinct integers required, the correctness of the program is false.
