You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program according to the problem description, let's analyze its functionality and consider potential edge cases that it may not handle correctly.

The problem requires determining if two distinct integers can be chosen so that both players can take all the cards, and each player ends up with an equal number of cards. 

### Analysis of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program collects the number of cards `n` and then fills up a list `a` with the numbers written on the cards. This part appears to be working as intended.

2. **Count Occurrences**: It counts how many times each number appears on the cards using a dictionary `d`. This is also functional and necessary for the next steps.

3. **Checking Fairness**:
   - It looks for two distinct integers whose counts are exactly `n // 2`, meaning both numbers should have the same count of cards.
   - The code maintains a count variable `c` to track how many numbers have been found with this exact count.

4. **Output Results**:
   - If two such distinct integers are found, it prints "YES" and the integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases Not Handled Correctly:
- **Edge Case for All Cards Being the Same**: The program does not specifically check if `n` cards are identical before counting, however, it naturally falls under the check where it can't find two distinct integers if there are none.
- **Counts Greater than n//2**: If there's a card number that appears more than `n//2`, it won't affect fairness, but they still need two distinct numbers. If `n` equals 2 and both cards are the same (for example, `[6, 6]`), it prints "NO" correctly but the reasoning is a bit convoluted. There's also a risk of misinterpreting counts.
- **Any case where two distinct integers don't both meet the requirement**: The logic assumes that if numbers exist in the required count, the game can always be fair. However, we could have a case where it outputs "NO" when it should not (failing to find two proper pairs).

### Example of a Failing Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  4
  1
  1
  2
  3
  ```
  Here, there are two '1's but we don't have any pairs of a count that is equal to `n // 2` (which is 2).

After analyzing the code logic and potential failing edge cases:
The program does not correctly account for all required scenarios, particularly when handling counts that do not yield two distinct integers with the required counts.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer in the range [2, 100], and the following n integers, each in the range [1, 100], represent the numbers on the n cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list containing `n` integers input by the user.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100], `d` is a dictionary mapping each integer from `a` to its count of occurrences, and `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; `c` is 0 or 1; `a1` is -1 or a key in `d` satisfying `d[i] == n // 2`; `a2` is -1 or a key in `d` satisfying `d[i] == n // 2`.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an even integer in the range [2, 100]; c is 0 or 1. If both a1 and a2 are valid keys in d, then a1 and a2 are printed. Otherwise, at least one of a1 or a2 is -1, and "NO" is printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
