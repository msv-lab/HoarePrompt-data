The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down its correctness based on the analysis of its logic and the requirements outlined:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading an even integer `n` (the number of cards) followed by `n` integers (the values on the cards). This matches the problem specification.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It constructs a dictionary `d` that counts how many times each integer appears among the cards. This is necessary for determining if there are two different integers that can be chosen such that each player ends up with the same number of cardsâ€”specifically, `n/2`.

3. **Finding Valid Pairs**: The program initializes a counter `c` to keep track of how many valid integers have been found that have precisely `n/2` counts. It successfully identifies up to two distinct integers (`a1` and `a2`) that each appear `n/2` times.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
    - If both `a1` and `a2` are found (i.e., `c` equals 2 after the loop), the program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the two integers, indicating a fair game is possible.
    - If not, it outputs "NO", indicating that a fair game is impossible.

### Cases Considered:
- Case with identical cards (Example 2) correctly returns "NO" since the available integers are not distinct.
- Various pairs of integers leading to equal distribution of cards (Examples 1 and 4) are handled correctly to yield "YES" and their values.
- The program appropriately identifies when no valid pairs exist (as shown in Example 3).

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the logic specified in the problem description: it correctly assesses the conditions under which a fair game is impossible or possible and provides accurate outputs. 

Thus, the correctness of the program can be stated as:

Correctness: **True**
