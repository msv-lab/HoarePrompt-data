Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that would lead to incorrect outputs in certain situations. Hereâ€™s a potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
4
1
1
2
2
```
In this case:
1. Petya would see that there are 2 cards with the number 1 and 2 cards with the number 2.
2. However, since Petya and Vasya need to choose different numbers but in this case both can only choose numbers that are different but would lead to a fair distribution of cards:
   - Petya could choose 1 and would take 2 cards, while Vasya would choose 2 and also take 2 cards. Thus, it is valid.
   
However, the output of the current program will print:
```
NO
```
This is incorrect because there is indeed a fair way to distribute the cards. 

Additionally, the program only checks if any number appears exactly `n//2` times to declare "YES", without accounting for scenarios where both chosen numbers need to exist such that both players receive the same number of cards evenly and that their chosen numbers must also be different.

Therefore, the program does not always adhere to the problem's requirements and will fail for several valid scenarios.
