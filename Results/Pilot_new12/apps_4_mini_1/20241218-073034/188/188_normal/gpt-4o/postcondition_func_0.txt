The function processes an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) input following `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100. It checks the frequency of these integers. If there are fewer than two unique integers, it outputs 'NO'. If there are at least two unique integers and the counts of the two least frequent integers are both equal to `n // 2`, it outputs 'YES', followed by the two integers. If the conditions are not met, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not accept parameters and reads directly from standard input. It has no explicit return value but communicates results through printed output. Potential edge cases include scenarios where all integers are the same or there are multiple integers, but their counts do not meet the required conditions for a 'YES' response.
