You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6

Output
NO

Input

10
20
30

10
20

Output
NO

Input

1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Requirements:** The problem requires selecting two distinct integers from a list of cards such that both integers have the same count (n/2) of cards. If this is possible, the output should be "YES" followed by the two numbers. If not, the output should be "NO".

2. **Analysis of the Provided Program:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each number on the cards using the `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It checks unique numbers in descending order of their counts.
   - If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it outputs "NO".
   - If the two most common numbers have exactly n/2 cards each, it prints "YES" and those two numbers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   
3. **Check for Edge Cases:**
   - There needs to be at least two distinct numbers on the cards.
   - Both distinct numbers must have exactly n/2 occurrences.

4. **Examining Potential Edge Cases:**
   - Consider an input where there are two distinct numbers but their counts do not equal n/2. For instance,
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     2
     2
     ```
     This should yield "YES", with numbers "1" and "2", as both have 2 occurrences each.
     
   - Conversely, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     1
     2
     ```
     The output should be "NO" because although there are two distinct numbers, they do not have the same count of n/2 (i.e., 2).

5. **Mistake in the Current Program Logic:**
   The program only checks if the two most frequent numbers match the exact count of n/2. If the distribution is not strictly equal for the two highest counts, it returns "NO." That means it cannot produce correct results for cases like the one where we have two distinct numbers with counts adding up to n but not equal.

In summary, the program does not effectively account for all scenarios in which the two players can still have an equal number of cards but don't meet the strict condition being checked (specifically counting). 

Therefore, the result is:

Correctness: **False**. 

An example of failure is:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
Here, it should output "YES" for numbers 1 and 2, but it won't correctly identify this situation due to its strict count checks. Hence, it produces a wrong outcome.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) input following `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100. It checks the frequency of these integers. If there are fewer than two unique integers, it outputs 'NO'. If there are at least two unique integers and the counts of the two least frequent integers are both equal to `n // 2`, it outputs 'YES', followed by the two integers. If the conditions are not met, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not accept parameters and reads directly from standard input. It has no explicit return value but communicates results through printed output. Potential edge cases include scenarios where all integers are the same or there are multiple integers, but their counts do not meet the required conditions for a 'YES' response.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
