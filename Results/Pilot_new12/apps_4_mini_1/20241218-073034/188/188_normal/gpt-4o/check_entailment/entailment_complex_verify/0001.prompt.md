You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input

11
27
27

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    elif count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2:
        print('YES')
        print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step-by-step against the provided rules of the game.

### Problem Analysis
1. Petya and Vasya need to choose distinct integers so that all cards can be taken evenly between them.
2. The game is fair if:
   - Every card can be taken (i.e., all cards must belong to either Petya's or Vasya's choice).
   - The number of cards taken by both players is equal.

### Steps of the Code
1. **Input Read**: The code reads an integer `n` which is the total number of cards and then reads `n` integers for the cards.
2. **Counting**: It counts the occurrences of each card using `Counter`.
3. **Unique Numbers Handling**:
   - The program checks if there are fewer than 2 unique numbers. If so, it prints "NO" (as there can't be two distinct integers).
   - It sorts the unique numbers based on their counts in descending order.
4. **Fairness Check**:
   - It specifically checks if the two most common numbers each have exactly `n // 2` counts. If so, it prints "YES" along with the two numbers. If this condition isn't met, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Single Unique Number**: If the input cards are all the same (e.g., `1, 1, 1, 1`), the program correctly prints "NO".
  
2. **Two Unique Numbers Only**: If both unique numbers appear the same number of times but do not add up to `n` (e.g. `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`), it should print "NO".

3. **Counts Not Equal**: The program wrongly checks only the top two numbers. Suppose we have cards like these: `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`. It has three unique numbers, but neither combination of any two unique numbers sums to `n` cards in equal parts, which it fails to check comprehensively. 

### Testing with Example Failure Case
Consider the input:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
In the case where there are two 1s and two 2s:
- The counts of both numbers are `2`, but the program looks at the two most common and incorrectly believes it’s fair. Specifically:
  - The game is fair if both players choose `1` and `2`, bearing in mind they can split the cards evenly, but the implementation may have issues when it checks unique numbers without double-checking for lesser counts or configurations.

Based on this and seeing how the program fails to cover edge cases where there are more than two potential unique numbers having valid conditions, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False** 

### Summary
The code does not adequately ensure that all possible pairs of unique cards with their counts meet the fairness requirement, leading to potential failures in correctness for valid scenarios as outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer between 2 and 100, and the next n lines contain integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    if (len(unique_numbers) < 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (count[unique_numbers[-1]] == n // 2 and count[unique_numbers[-2]] == n // 2) :
            print('YES')
            print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `count.keys()` based on their frequency in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2. If the counts of the two least frequent integers in `unique_numbers` are both equal to `n // 2`, `print` outputs `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`, and `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `count.keys()` based on their frequency in ascending order. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed. If the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2, and the counts of the two least frequent integers are both equal to `n // 2`, the output is `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) input following `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100. It checks the frequency of these integers. If there are fewer than two unique integers, it outputs 'NO'. If there are at least two unique integers and the counts of the two least frequent integers are both equal to `n // 2`, it outputs 'YES', followed by the two integers. If the conditions are not met, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not accept parameters and reads directly from standard input. It has no explicit return value but communicates results through printed output. Potential edge cases include scenarios where all integers are the same or there are multiple integers, but their counts do not meet the required conditions for a 'YES' response.
