To verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Requirements:** The problem requires selecting two distinct integers from a list of cards such that both integers have the same count (n/2) of cards. If this is possible, the output should be "YES" followed by the two numbers. If not, the output should be "NO".

2. **Analysis of the Provided Program:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each number on the cards using the `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It checks unique numbers in descending order of their counts.
   - If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it outputs "NO".
   - If the two most common numbers have exactly n/2 cards each, it prints "YES" and those two numbers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   
3. **Check for Edge Cases:**
   - There needs to be at least two distinct numbers on the cards.
   - Both distinct numbers must have exactly n/2 occurrences.

4. **Examining Potential Edge Cases:**
   - Consider an input where there are two distinct numbers but their counts do not equal n/2. For instance,
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     2
     2
     ```
     This should yield "YES", with numbers "1" and "2", as both have 2 occurrences each.
     
   - Conversely, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     1
     1
     1
     2
     ```
     The output should be "NO" because although there are two distinct numbers, they do not have the same count of n/2 (i.e., 2).

5. **Mistake in the Current Program Logic:**
   The program only checks if the two most frequent numbers match the exact count of n/2. If the distribution is not strictly equal for the two highest counts, it returns "NO." That means it cannot produce correct results for cases like the one where we have two distinct numbers with counts adding up to n but not equal.

In summary, the program does not effectively account for all scenarios in which the two players can still have an equal number of cards but don't meet the strict condition being checked (specifically counting). 

Therefore, the result is:

Correctness: **False**. 

An example of failure is:
```
4
1
1
2
2
```
Here, it should output "YES" for numbers 1 and 2, but it won't correctly identify this situation due to its strict count checks. Hence, it produces a wrong outcome.
