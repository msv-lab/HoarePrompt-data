Correctness: **False**

The program checks for equal distribution of cards for two distinct chosen integers from the list. However, it has a flaw in the logic that checks whether the two most frequent integers have counts equal to `n // 2`. Specifically, it only checks the two least frequent unique numbers (the last two from `unique_numbers` sorted by frequency), which does not guarantee that the chosen integers will allow both players to take all cards fairly.

A critical counterexample is when there are four distinct integers, but only two of them appear twice each, and the other two appear zero times. The program would fail to address this case correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

For example:

Input:
```
4
1
1
2
3
```

Expected output is `YES` with a choice of `1` and `2`, but the program would output `NO` because it is incorrectly looking for the highest frequency counts. The logic fails to ensure both players can take all cards equally, which the problem explicitly requires. 

Thus, there exists a scenario where the output is incorrect, confirming that the implementation is flawed and does not adhere strictly to the problem description for every potential case.
