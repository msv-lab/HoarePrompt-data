The code prints the last two unique numbers from the sorted list `unique_numbers`, specifically `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Given the conditions that `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` and `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` are both equal to `n // 2`, the output will reflect the values of these two unique integers.

Since `unique_numbers` is sorted based on frequency, `unique_numbers[-1]` is the most frequent number, and `unique_numbers[-2]` is the second most frequent number, both having the same frequency of `n // 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output will summarize the printed values.

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `count.keys()` based on their frequency in ascending order; `print` outputs `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`.**
