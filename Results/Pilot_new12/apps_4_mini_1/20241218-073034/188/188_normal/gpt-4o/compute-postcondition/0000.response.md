The code assigns a new value to `n` by converting the input value from the user into an integer. The precondition states that `n` was an even integer between 2 and 100, and after the execution of the code, `n` will now take the value of the userâ€™s input, which must also be an integer and fits within that range. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100.**
