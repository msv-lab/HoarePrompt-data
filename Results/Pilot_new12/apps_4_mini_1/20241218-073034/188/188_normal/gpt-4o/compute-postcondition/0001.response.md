The code creates a list called `cards` by reading `n` number of integers from input. Since `n` is stated to be an input even integer between 2 and 100, this means the variable `cards` will contain `n` integers, each of which is determined by the user's input. The other variables remain unaffected in this case.

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from input.**
