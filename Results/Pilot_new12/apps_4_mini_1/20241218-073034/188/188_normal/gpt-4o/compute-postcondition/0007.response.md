Postcondition: ***`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `count.keys()` based on their frequency in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2. The current value of `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` is equal to `n // 2`, and the current value of `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` is also equal to `n // 2.`***
