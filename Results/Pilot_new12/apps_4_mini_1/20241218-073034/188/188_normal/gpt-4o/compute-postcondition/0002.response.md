`count` is assigned the value of `Counter(cards)`, which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `cards`. The variable `cards` remains as a list of `n` integers, and `n` remains as an even integer between 2 and 100. The value of `count` will be a Counter object containing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`.**
