Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from input; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `count.keys()` based on their frequency in ascending order, length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2; either `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` is not equal to `n // 2`, or `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` is not equal to `n // 2`, or both; the output is 'NO'.**
