Postcondition: ***`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `cards`, and `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of the unique integers from `count.keys()` based on their frequency in ascending order. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, 'NO' is printed. If the length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2, and the counts of the two least frequent integers are both equal to `n // 2`, the output is `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
