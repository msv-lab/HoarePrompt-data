`cnt4` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so their values are still valid. 

Output State: **`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_1` <= 10^9; `cnt_2` is an input integer; `cnt_3` remains unchanged; `cnt_4` is an input integer; `cnt1` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; `cnt4` is assigned an input integer value.**
