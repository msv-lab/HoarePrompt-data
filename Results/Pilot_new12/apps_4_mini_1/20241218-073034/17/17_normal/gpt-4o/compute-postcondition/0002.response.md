The variable `cnt3` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that will be converted to an integer by the `int` function. Since `cnt_3` is mentioned to be unchanged, we need to mention explicitly that its value remains the same. The other variables, `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, and `cnt1`, are also unchanged. 

Output State: **`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_1` <= 10^9; `cnt_2` is an input integer; `cnt_3` remains unchanged; `cnt_4` is unchanged; `cnt1` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer.**
