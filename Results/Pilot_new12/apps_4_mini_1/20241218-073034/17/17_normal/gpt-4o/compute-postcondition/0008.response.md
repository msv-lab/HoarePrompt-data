Postcondition: ***`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_1` <= 10^9; `cnt_2` is an input integer; `cnt_3` remains unchanged; `cnt_4` is an input integer assigned with an input integer value; `cnt1` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer. If `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`, the conditions hold true. Otherwise, if `cnt1 + cnt2` does not equal `cnt3 + cnt4` or `cnt2` is less than `cnt3`, `0` has been printed.***
