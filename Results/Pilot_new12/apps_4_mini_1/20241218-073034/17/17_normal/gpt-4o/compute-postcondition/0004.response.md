Postcondition: ***`cnt_1` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_1` <= 10^9; `cnt_2` is an input integer; `cnt_3` remains unchanged; `cnt_4` is an input integer assigned with an input integer value; `cnt1` is an input integer; `cnt3` is an input integer; the current values satisfy the condition that `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4`, and `cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`.***
