The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are all non-negative integers in the range of 0 to 10^9, but since these variables are not part of the function's input, we cannot directly associate them with its functionality. 

Without specific output information, we cannot describe the return values or any specific cases relating to the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value or behavior is undefined based on the provided information.**
