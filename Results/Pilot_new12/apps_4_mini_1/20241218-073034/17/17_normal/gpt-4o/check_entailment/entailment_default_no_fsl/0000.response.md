Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all the potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, while it checks if `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4` and if `cnt2 >= cnt3`, it fails to consider the necessary balance between the left and right brackets when constructing a valid regular bracket sequence.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
1
0
0
1
```

In this case, we have:
- `cnt1 = 1` ("((")
- `cnt2 = 0` ("()")
- `cnt3 = 0` (")(")
- `cnt4 = 1` ("))")

The expected output should be `0` (not possible to form a valid sequence), but given the current logic, it will return `1` because `cnt1 + cnt2` equals `cnt3 + cnt4` (1 = 1) and `cnt2 >= cnt3` (0 >= 0). Thus, it incorrectly concludes that a valid regular bracket sequence can be formed.

The logic should also account for how the particular counts of each input type interact with one another to ensure that there are enough opening brackets to match the closing brackets. Hence, the implementation fails for some valid edge cases which would not yield a proper bracket sequence.
