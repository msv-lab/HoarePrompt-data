You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and see if there are any scenarios where it may fail.

The problem requires forming a regular bracket sequence from counts of four different types of strings: `( (`, `( )`, `) (`, and `) )`. The conditions for a sequence to be regular are important to establish:

1. A sequence is regular if at any point in the sequence, the number of closing brackets `)` does not exceed the number of opening brackets `(`.
2. At the end of the sequence, the total number of opening brackets `(` must equal the total number of closing brackets `)`.

### Variables:
- `cnt1`: Count of the string `"(("`
- `cnt2`: Count of the string `"()"`
- `cnt3`: Count of the string `")("`
- `cnt4`: Count of the string `"))"`

From the problem statement, we can derive the following conditions to form a regular bracket sequence:

- Since strings `cnt3` (which contributes with one closing and one opening bracket `")("`) can only be balanced out by the strings `cnt1` (which only opens) by having at least as many opening brackets as we have closing from `cnt3`, we need to ensure that **`cnt3` must not exceed `cnt1`**. 
- The closing brackets contributed by `cnt4` (which contributes only closing `")"`) must also be met by the available counts of opening brackets left after taking `cnt3` into account.

### Analyzing the Program:

The program checks:
1. If `cnt3` (the number of `")("` strings) is greater than `cnt1` (the number of `"("` strings), it outputs `0` indicating it can't form a regular sequence.
2. If `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, it outputs `1` indicating it can form a regular bracket sequence.

### Cases for Analysis:
1. **Zero Counts:**
   - If all counts are zero (`cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0, cnt3 = 0, cnt4 = 0`), the program correctly outputs `1`.
   
2. **Balanced Counts:**
   - When `cnt1 = 1, cnt2 = 1, cnt3 = 1, cnt4 = 0`, the program outputs `1`. This forms `()()(` but it does not account that the output should actually be `0` because it can't balance with equal closing brackets to open at each step.

3. **Excess Closing with No Opens:**
   - If `cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0, cnt3 = 1, cnt4 = 0`, the program outputs `1`, indicating it's possible to form a sequence, but here you have `")("` which also does not satisfy the requirement and should yield `0`.

4. **General Cases:**
   - As the number of `cnt4` increases, having no previous opens will violate regularity leading to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program misses edge cases where `cnt4` or the balance with `cnt2` may be crucial in determining a valid configuration. 

**Correctness: False**. 

The logic is flawed as it does not account for contributions from `cnt4` and the balance between opening and closing brackets throughout the sequence, leading to potential invalid bracket sequences.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
def func():
    cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if (cnt3 > cnt1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are non-negative integers where 0 <= `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9. If `cnt_3` is greater than `cnt_1`, the output is 0. Otherwise, `cnt_3` is less than or equal to `cnt_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four non-negative integers from user input and assigns them to variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. It then checks if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`. If it is, the function prints `0`. If `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, it prints `1`. The function does not return any values and does not modify the input values, which remain unchanged. Notably, the function does not validate the range of inputs or handle edge cases where inputs may not be integers or are outside the specified bounds. Additionally, `cnt2` and `cnt4` are read but unused, which means the state of these variables does not impact the functionality of the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
