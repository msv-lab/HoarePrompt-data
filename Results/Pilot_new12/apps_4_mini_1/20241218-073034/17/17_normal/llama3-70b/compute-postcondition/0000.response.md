In the provided code snippet, `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are assigned values based on user input. The initial state indicates that these variables are non-negative integers, each within the range of 0 to \(10^9\). 

The code uses `map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])` to read four inputs and convert them into integers, which are assigned to `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. 

Since the inputs are directly taken from user input, the specific values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` after execution will be the integers supplied by the user. However, we know they remain non-negative integers fitting the specified constraints.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- The variables `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` will have values based on user input.
- Other variables currently in state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are non-negative integers where 0 <= `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9, and `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are assigned input integer values**.
