The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle cases based on certain conditions related to the values of several non-negative integers (cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4) that are implicitly utilized within the function.

However, since these integers are part of the function's logic but not passed as parameters, the information about their specific relationships and constraints is not reflected directly in the function's signature.

As the function outputs are not provided, the description remains unclear regarding the return values or conditions of output. 

In conclusion, without additional output cases and based only on the information presented:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and has undefined return values based on unspecified conditions.**
