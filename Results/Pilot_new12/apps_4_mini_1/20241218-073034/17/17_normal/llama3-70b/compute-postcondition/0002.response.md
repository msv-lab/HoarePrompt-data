The code `print(0)` simply outputs the value `0`, and does not affect any of the variables in the state. The states of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are non-negative integers where 0 <= `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9, and `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are assigned input integer values. The current value of `cnt_3` is greater than the current value of `cnt_1`. The output is 0.**
