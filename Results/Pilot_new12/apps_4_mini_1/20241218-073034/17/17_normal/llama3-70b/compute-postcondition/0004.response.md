The `print(1)` statement outputs the integer `1` to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, or `cnt_4`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` are non-negative integers where 0 <= `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9, and `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, `cnt4` are assigned input integer values. The value of `cnt_3` is less than or equal to `cnt_1`**.
