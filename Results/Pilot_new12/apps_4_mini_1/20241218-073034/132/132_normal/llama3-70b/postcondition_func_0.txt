The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and two lists of integers `x` and `y`, each of length `n`. The values in `x` represent the number of stones in the first visit, and the values in `y` represent the number of stones in the second visit. It first checks if the sums of the elements in `x` and `y` are equal. If they are not equal, the function outputs 'No'. If the sums are equal, the function then sorts both lists and checks if the sorted lists are identical. If they are the same, it outputs 'Yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'No'. The program does not handle any exceptions or cases where the inputs may not conform to the specified ranges. Moreover, it relies on user input without validating that the inputs are integers or within the expected size limits, which could lead to runtime errors.
