The code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs the string 'Yes'. The values of the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. However, since the code includes a print statement that generates output, the output state reflects that this particular output has been produced.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a sorted list of integers based on input; `y` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` containing the integer inputs after executing the code; the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`. The lists `x` and `y` are equal (i.e., `x == y`). Output is 'Yes'.**
