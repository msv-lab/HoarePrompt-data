The variable `x` is assigned the value of the list created by mapping the input integers (split by spaces) to integers. The variable `n` remains the same as it still indicates the length of the list `x`, and the variable `y` remains unchanged in this context. The output state shows that `x` now holds a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of integers based on input; `y` is a list of integers of length n where each element represents the number of stones in the second visit (0 <= y_i <= 1000)**.
