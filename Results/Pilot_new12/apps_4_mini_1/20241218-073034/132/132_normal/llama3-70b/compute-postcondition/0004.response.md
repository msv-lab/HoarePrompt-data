The code snippet `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console. This action does not change the state of the input `n`, `x`, or `y`, but it indicates that a condition related to the elements of the lists has been evaluated.

Since the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, the program likely is indicating that some condition has been met that necessitates this output.

However, the variables involved retain their states:
- `n` remains an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50.
- `x` remains a list of integers based on input.
- `y` remains a list of integers of length `n` containing the integer inputs.

The output state is thus reflective of the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of integers based on input; `y` is a list of integers of length `n` containing the integer inputs; the program printed 'No'.**
