Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of integers based on input and `y` is a list of integers of length `n` containing the integer inputs. If the sum of the elements in `x` is not equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, the program prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, then `x` is a sorted list of integers and `y` is also a sorted list of integers; if `x` is equal to `y`, the output is 'Yes'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is 'No'.***
