`y` is assigned the value of a list created from the input values, which are split and converted to integers. The length of `y` will equal `n`, and its elements (denoted as `y_i`) are expected to be in the range [0, 1000]. The state of `n` remains unchanged, while `x` retains its previous state and may still hold any list of integers based on input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50; `x` is a list of integers based on input; `y` is a list of integers of length `n` containing the integer inputs after executing the code.**
