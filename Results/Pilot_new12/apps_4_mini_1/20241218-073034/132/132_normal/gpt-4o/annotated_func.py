#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, x is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and y is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is also between 0 and 1000 inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if (total_y > total_x) :
        print('No')
    else :
        print('Yes')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `y` is a list of non-negative integers based on user input that are between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, the condition is met. Otherwise, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, 'Yes' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function reads user input to obtain an integer `n`, followed by two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` non-negative integers ranging from 0 to 1000. It calculates the total sum of the integers in list `x` (denoted as `total_x`) and the total sum of the integers in list `y` (denoted as `total_y`). The function then evaluates whether `total_y` is greater than `total_x`. If `total_y` exceeds `total_x`, it prints 'No', and if it is less than or equal to `total_x`, it prints 'Yes'. The state after the conclusion of the function reflects that `n` remains between 1 and 50, `x` and `y` are lists of size `n` composed of non-negative integers, and the results of the comparison are indicated by the printed output. The function does not handle invalid input scenarios, such as non-integer values or out-of-range integers, which could lead to runtime errors.
