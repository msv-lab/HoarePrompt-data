Functionality: The function reads user input to obtain an integer `n`, followed by two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` non-negative integers ranging from 0 to 1000. It calculates the total sum of the integers in list `x` (denoted as `total_x`) and the total sum of the integers in list `y` (denoted as `total_y`). The function then evaluates whether `total_y` is greater than `total_x`. If `total_y` exceeds `total_x`, it prints 'No', and if it is less than or equal to `total_x`, it prints 'Yes'. The state after the conclusion of the function reflects that `n` remains between 1 and 50, `x` and `y` are lists of size `n` composed of non-negative integers, and the results of the comparison are indicated by the printed output. The function does not handle invalid input scenarios, such as non-integer values or out-of-range integers, which could lead to runtime errors.
