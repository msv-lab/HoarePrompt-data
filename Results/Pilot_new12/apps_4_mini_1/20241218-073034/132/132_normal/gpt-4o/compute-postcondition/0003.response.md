The line of code `total_x = sum(x)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `x`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `x` consists of `n` non-negative integers provided through user input. After executing the code, `total_x` is assigned the value equal to the sum of all elements in the list `x`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a new list of integers based on user input that are non-negative and between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`.**
