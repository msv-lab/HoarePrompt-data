The `print('No')` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply outputs the string 'No'. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `total_x`, and `total_y` remain unaffected. The output does not alter the current state of the variables in any way.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a new list of non-negative integers based on user input that are between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of elements in `y`, and `total_y` is greater than `total_x`.**
