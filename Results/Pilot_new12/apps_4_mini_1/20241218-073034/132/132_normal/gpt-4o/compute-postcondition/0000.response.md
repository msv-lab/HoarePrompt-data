The variable `n` is reassigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input (a string representing an integer) and `int` converts it to an integer. The output state must reflect that `n` is now a value from its valid range (1 to 50) rather than a general positive integer. The other variables, `x` and `y`, remain unchanged in their definitions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is also between 0 and 1000 inclusive.**
