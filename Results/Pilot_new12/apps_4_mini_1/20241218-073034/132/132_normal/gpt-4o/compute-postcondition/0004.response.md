The variable `total_y` is assigned the value of the sum of elements in the list `y`. The value of `y` consists of non-negative integers that are between 0 and 1000 inclusive, but the specific contents of `y` are not known from the provided state. Therefore, `total_y` will be equal to the sum of the elements in the list `y`, which could range from 0 (if `y` is an empty list) to 1000 multiplied by `n` (if all values in `y` are at the maximum limit). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a new list of integers based on user input that are non-negative and between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of elements in `y`.**
