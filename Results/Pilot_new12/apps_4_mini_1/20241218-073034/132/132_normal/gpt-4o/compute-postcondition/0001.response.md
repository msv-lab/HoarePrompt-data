The variable `x` is reassigned to a new list created by mapping `int` to the input values (which are space-separated). The previous value of `x` will be replaced entirely. The value of `n` remains between 1 and 50, as that condition still holds. The list `y` remains unchanged. Therefore, we are left with the updated value of `x` as a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of n non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive.**
