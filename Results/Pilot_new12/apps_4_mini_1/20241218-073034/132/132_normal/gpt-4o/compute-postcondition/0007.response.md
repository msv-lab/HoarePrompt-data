Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a new list of integers based on user input that are non-negative and between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of elements in `y`. The sum of elements in `y` is less than or equal to the sum of elements in `x` (total_y <= total_x).***
