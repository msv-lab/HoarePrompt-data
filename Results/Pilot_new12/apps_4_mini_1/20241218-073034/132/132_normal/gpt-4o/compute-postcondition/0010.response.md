The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, with `n` being a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \) and each integer in `x` is between 0 and 1000 inclusive. Similarly, `y` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, also where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the relationship or operations performed on the lists `x` and `y`. However, since the output behavior is not specified, we cannot detail that.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x`, a list of `n` non-negative integers (0 to 1000), and `y`, a list of `n` non-negative integers (0 to 1000), where \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \).**
