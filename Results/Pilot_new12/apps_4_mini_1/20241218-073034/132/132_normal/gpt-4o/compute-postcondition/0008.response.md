The statement prints 'Yes', which has no effect on the variable states. The values of the variables remain as described in the initial state since no assignment or computation occurs. Therefore, the Output State includes all initial conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a new list of integers based on user input that are non-negative and between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of elements in `y`, and the sum of elements in `y` is less than or equal to the sum of elements in `x` (total_y <= total_x); 'Yes' is printed.**
