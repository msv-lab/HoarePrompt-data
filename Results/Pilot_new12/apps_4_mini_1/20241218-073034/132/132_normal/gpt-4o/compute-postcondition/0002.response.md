The variable `y` is reassigned the value obtained from `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will now hold a new list of integers inputted by the user. The length and values of `y` will depend on the number of integers entered, but it will still conform to the condition that each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers based on input, `y` is a new list of integers based on user input that are non-negative and between 0 and 1000 inclusive.**
