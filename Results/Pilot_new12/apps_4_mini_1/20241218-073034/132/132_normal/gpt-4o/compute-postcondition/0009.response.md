Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `y` is a list of non-negative integers based on user input that are between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of elements in `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, the condition is met. Otherwise, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, 'Yes' is printed.***
