You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if total_y > total_x:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires determining if the transition from one set of stone piles (`x`) to another (`y`) is possible given the constraints that stones can be taken (resulting in fewer stones) or moved between piles.

### Analyzing the Code
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if total_y > total_x:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
```

1. The program reads the number of piles `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` representing the stone counts in the piles at two different times.
2. It calculates the total number of stones for both lists (`total_x` for `x` and `total_y` for `y`).
3. It checks if the total stones in `y` (`total_y`) exceeds that in `x` (`total_x`). If it does, it immediately prints "No" because that scenario is impossible (you can't create stones).
4. If `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it prints "Yes".

### Potential Cases Where It Fails
While the logic seems valid regarding the total count of stones, it does not consider the distribution of stones between the piles. The output "Yes" in situations where we have uneven distributions could lead to incorrect conclusions.

For instance:
- Consider `x = [2, 3, 9]` and `y = [1, 7, 9]`. 
- The total number of stones stays the same (`total_x = 14`, `total_y = 17`), which makes `total_y` > `total_x`, leading to a "No" output.
- But this means we've taken stones from the first pile to even distribute them to the second pile.

Another case:
- `x = [1, 4, 3]` and `y = [3, 1, 4]`. 
- The total would be the same (both sums equal 8). However, to transition from `x` to `y`, you would need stones in ways that may not be directly interchangeable and thus is misleading.

### Conclusion
The code fails to validate that it's possible to not only maintain the total but also ensure that the stone counts can be reassessed when piles are rearranged or stones are distributed.

Hence, the program can conclude "Yes" in cases that are logically impossible due to the pile distribution. This presents a flaw.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function reads user input to obtain an integer `n`, followed by two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` non-negative integers ranging from 0 to 1000. It calculates the total sum of the integers in list `x` (denoted as `total_x`) and the total sum of the integers in list `y` (denoted as `total_y`). The function then evaluates whether `total_y` is greater than `total_x`. If `total_y` exceeds `total_x`, it prints 'No', and if it is less than or equal to `total_x`, it prints 'Yes'. The state after the conclusion of the function reflects that `n` remains between 1 and 50, `x` and `y` are lists of size `n` composed of non-negative integers, and the results of the comparison are indicated by the printed output. The function does not handle invalid input scenarios, such as non-integer values or out-of-range integers, which could lead to runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
