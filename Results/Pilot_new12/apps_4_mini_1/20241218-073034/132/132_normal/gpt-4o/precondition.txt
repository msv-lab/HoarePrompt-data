n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, x is a list of n non-negative integers representing the number of stones in piles during the first visit (0 <= x[i] <= 1000), and y is a list of n non-negative integers representing the number of stones in piles during the second visit (0 <= y[i] <= 1000).
