The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (set to \(10^9 + 7\)). It calculates the factorial of `n` by iterating from 2 to `n`, multiplying the numbers together, and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow. At the end of execution, the function returns the computed factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, but given the constraints, inputs will always be valid within the specified range. The final state of the program is that it returns this factorial value.
