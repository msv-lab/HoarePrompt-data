#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), `result` is \(n!\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `i` is \(n\)
    return result
    #The program returns the factorial of n modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and result holds this value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (set to \(10^9 + 7\)). It calculates the factorial of `n` by iterating from 2 to `n`, multiplying the numbers together, and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow. At the end of execution, the function returns the computed factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, but given the constraints, inputs will always be valid within the specified range. The final state of the program is that it returns this factorial value.
