Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The main issue is that it only computes the factorial of `n - 1` for `n > 2`, which does not correspond to the problem's requirement to count the permutations where \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). 

In the problem description, \( f_{max}(n) \) is the maximum number of distinct GCDs from all permutations of the integers \( 1 \) through \( n \). However, the code does not calculate \( f(p) \) for each permutation and simply returns the factorial of \( n - 1 \), which does not cover all the required permutations and their associated calculations.

For example:
- For \( n = 3 \), \( f_{max}(3) = 2 \) and there are 4 valid permutations that yield this value of \( f(p) \). The program does not account for counting those configurations correctly.
- The output hints indicate that the function calculates the factorial of `n - 1`, which is unrelated to the accurate counting of \( f(p) \).

Therefore, the essential logic is completely missing in this implementation, leading to incorrect outputs for various values of \( n \). The provided cases demonstrate a lack of handling for the required logic around distinct GCD counts, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
