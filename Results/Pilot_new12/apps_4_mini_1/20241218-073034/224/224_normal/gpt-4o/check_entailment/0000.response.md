To assess the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the logic.

1. The program takes an integer `n` which represents the length of permutations of integers from `1` to `n`.
2. It checks if `n` is equal to `2`. If true, it outputs `1` since the only permutation of `[1, 2]` yields `f(p) = 1`.
3. For `n > 2`, it calls the `func_1` function with `n - 1` as an argument. This function calculates the factorial of the input `n`, which is the product of all integers from `2` to `n`.

The problem description focuses on counting the permutations where `f(p) = f_max(n)`. The provided program calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which does not correctly reflect the requirement of counting the permutations resulting in the maximum value of `f(p)`:

- The correct `f_max(n)` may vary depending on the specific arrangement of the elements in the permutations. The output of the program does not handle scenarios where the configurations could lead to different values of `f(p)` other than just multiplying the factorial for `n-1`.

### Counter Example
For `n = 3`, let's evaluate:
- The permutations of `[1, 2, 3]` yield `f(p)` values that are relevant:
  - `[1, 2, 3]`: `f(p) = 1`
  - `[1, 3, 2]`: `f(p) = 1`
  - `[2, 1, 3]`: `f(p) = 2`
  - `[2, 3, 1]`: `f(p) = 2`
  - `[3, 1, 2]`: `f(p) = 2`
  - `[3, 2, 1]`: `f(p) = 2`

From the calculations:
- Here, `f_max(3) = 2` and there are `4` permutations where `f(p) = 2`. The program incorrectly calculates the result as `func_1(n - 1)` which gives `2! = 2` instead of counting how many permutations yield the max value of `f(p)`.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **False**.
