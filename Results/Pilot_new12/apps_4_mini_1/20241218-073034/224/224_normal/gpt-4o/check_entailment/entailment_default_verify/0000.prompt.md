You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Program:
```
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the logic.

1. The program takes an integer `n` which represents the length of permutations of integers from `1` to `n`.
2. It checks if `n` is equal to `2`. If true, it outputs `1` since the only permutation of `[1, 2]` yields `f(p) = 1`.
3. For `n > 2`, it calls the `func_1` function with `n - 1` as an argument. This function calculates the factorial of the input `n`, which is the product of all integers from `2` to `n`.

The problem description focuses on counting the permutations where `f(p) = f_max(n)`. The provided program calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which does not correctly reflect the requirement of counting the permutations resulting in the maximum value of `f(p)`:

- The correct `f_max(n)` may vary depending on the specific arrangement of the elements in the permutations. The output of the program does not handle scenarios where the configurations could lead to different values of `f(p)` other than just multiplying the factorial for `n-1`.

### Counter Example
For `n = 3`, let's evaluate:
- The permutations of `[1, 2, 3]` yield `f(p)` values that are relevant:
  - `[1, 2, 3]`: `f(p) = 1`
  - `[1, 3, 2]`: `f(p) = 1`
  - `[2, 1, 3]`: `f(p) = 2`
  - `[2, 3, 1]`: `f(p) = 2`
  - `[3, 1, 2]`: `f(p) = 2`
  - `[3, 2, 1]`: `f(p) = 2`

From the calculations:
- Here, `f_max(3) = 2` and there are `4` permutations where `f(p) = 2`. The program incorrectly calculates the result as `func_1(n - 1)` which gives `2! = 2` instead of counting how many permutations yield the max value of `f(p)`.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (set to \(10^9 + 7\)). It calculates the factorial of `n` by iterating from 2 to `n`, multiplying the numbers together, and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow. At the end of execution, the function returns the computed factorial modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, but given the constraints, inputs will always be valid within the specified range. The final state of the program is that it returns this factorial value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
