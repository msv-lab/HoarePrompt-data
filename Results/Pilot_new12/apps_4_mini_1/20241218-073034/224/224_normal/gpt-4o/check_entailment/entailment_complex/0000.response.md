The program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Problem Description**: The essential task is to calculate the number of permutations of integers \(1\) through \(n\) such that \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\). The function \(f(p)\) is based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of prefixes of the permutation and requires a count of how many such permutations exist.

2. **Program Functionality**:
    - The program defines a function `func_1`, which computes the factorial of \(n\) (specifically \(n-1\)) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It does not take into account the attributes of the permutations or the distinct \(f(p)\) values as required by the problem.
    - The conditional check for \(n\) being 2 directly returns the result as 1, which does not correspond to the count of valid permutations of numbers 1 and 2 that meet the required properties set forth in the problem.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: 
    - The calculations done in `func_1` do not address the need to evaluate all permutations and determine their respective \(f(p)\) values. The approach taken is merely computational for factorials, which does not solve the problem as described.
  
### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect as it does not compute the count of permutations that yield \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\), nor does it derive any useful information about \(f(p)\) or how to ascertain its maximum.

Thus, the Correctness: **False**.
