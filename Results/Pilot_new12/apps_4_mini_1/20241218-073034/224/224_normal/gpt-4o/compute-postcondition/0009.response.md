The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `mod`. `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^6, and `mod` is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7. The function returns the factorial of `n` modulo 10^9 + 7. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and return the factorial of `n` calculated under modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and mod, and returns the factorial of n modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.**
