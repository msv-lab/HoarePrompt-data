The code assigns a value of 1 to the variable `result`. The values of `n` and `mod` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7, `result` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is an integer equal to 10^9 + 7, `result` is 1**.
