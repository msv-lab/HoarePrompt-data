According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, therefore `i` will become 4. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 4, so that `i` (which is now 4) is still less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 4**
