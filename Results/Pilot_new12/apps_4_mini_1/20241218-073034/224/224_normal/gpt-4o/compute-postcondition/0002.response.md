In the given code, `result` is updated by multiplying its current value with `i` and then taking the result modulo `mod`. The previous value of `result` is 1, and the value of `i` is 2. 

Calculating the new value of `result`:
```
result = 1 * 2 % (10^9 + 7)
result = 2 % (10^9 + 7)
result = 2
```

The values of `n`, `mod`, and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state includes the updated value of `result` while keeping the other variable values the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
