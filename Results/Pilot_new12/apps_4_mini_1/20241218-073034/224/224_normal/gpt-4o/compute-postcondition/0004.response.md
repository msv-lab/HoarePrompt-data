The variable `result` is updated with the value of `result * i % mod`. Given `result` is initially 2, `i` is 3, and `mod` is \(10^9 + 7\), we perform the calculation as follows:

1. Compute `result * i`: 
   - \(2 * 3 = 6\)

2. Now, compute \(6 \mod (10^9 + 7)\):
   - Since \(6\) is much less than \(10^9 + 7\), the result is \(6\).

Thus, `result` is updated to \(6\), while `n`, `mod`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state is updated to reflect the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 3**
