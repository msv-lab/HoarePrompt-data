According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 2 to n + 1. For the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 2; otherwise, the range would be empty. Given that `n` is specified to be between 2 and \( 10^6 \), the loop will indeed execute since \( n \) is within the valid range. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will start at 2, which is the first value in the range. As per the initial state provided, `result` is 1, which is an appropriate value to start with. 

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to note the values of `i` and `n` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 1, `i` is 2**
