#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It modifies the values of `a` and `b` through a loop until `b` is zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original input values. The function then returns this GCD. It does not include error handling for non-positive integers, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the inputs are not strictly positive as expected. Overall, the final state of the program is that the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `res` is equal to max(res_initial, func_1(res_initial, 1), func_1(res_initial, 2), ..., func_1(res_initial, n)); `i` is equal to n.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value among res_initial and func_1 applied to res_initial for each integer from 1 to n, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value, `res`, which is initialized to 0. It iterates through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` to `res` and the current integer `i`. The result of each call to `func_1` is compared with the current maximum (`res`), and `res` is updated accordingly. At the end of the loop, `res` contains the highest value obtained from the initial value of 0 and the results of `func_1`, which is then returned. The potential edge case is that if `func_1` is not correctly defined for all expected inputs, this may lead to unexpected results, but the function itself does not handle such errors or inconsistencies explicitly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dp[j]` contains the final values that are the result of cumulative sums of `dp[k]` for `0 <= k <= f_max_n`, each taken modulo `MOD`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which contains the final values that are the result of cumulative sums of dp[k] for 0 <= k <= f_max_n, each taken modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n`, a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (f_max_n >= 1). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. The function then computes cumulative sums in the `dp` array such that after `n` iterations, `dp[j]` contains the number of ways to obtain `j` using integers from 0 to `n`, under the condition that each `dp[j]` is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. The final result returned is `dp[f_max_n]`, representing the number of ways to achieve a sum of `f_max_n` using the available integers. 

Edge cases include the assumption that `f_max_n` is always >= 1 as per the function's precondition, and there is no handling for scenarios where `f_max_n` could be 0 or negative due to an incorrect input which may lead to index issues. In summary, the function effectively computes the number of ways to sum to `f_max_n` given the constraints of using numbers up to `n`, and properly handles large numbers through modular arithmetic.
