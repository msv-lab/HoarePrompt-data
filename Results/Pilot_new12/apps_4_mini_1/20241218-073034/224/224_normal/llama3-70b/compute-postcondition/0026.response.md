According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute while `j` is iterating from `f_max_n` down to 1. Therefore, for the loop to initiate, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, as `j` starts at the value of `f_max_n`. Given that `f_max_n` is stated to be greater than 0, this condition is satisfied.

At the beginning of the loop, `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`, which is in the valid range. The current values of `n`, `dp[j]`, and `i` do not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute successfully, the only states we need to ensure are that `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1 (which it is, since it must be greater than 0 according to the initial state). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` contains final values that are the result of cumulative sums of `dp[k]` for `1 <= k <= f_max_n` each taken modulo `MOD`.**
