According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, since the loop starts at `f_max_n` and counts down to 1. The state of `i` is not directly relevant for the execution of the loop itself, as it will not change during this specific loop execution.

To summarize, for the loop to be executed, `f_max_n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). Given that `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^6) and does not affect the loop's execution, we can keep it as is. The initial value of `i` is still valid but not relevant to this loop. 

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- `f_max_n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` should start at the current value of `f_max_n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
