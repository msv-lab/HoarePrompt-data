The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` impacts the state by modifying the value of `dp[j]`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `j` is equal to `f_max_n`
- `dp[j]` contains final values that are the result of cumulative sums of `dp[k]` for `1 <= k <= f_max_n`, each taken modulo `MOD`.
- By adding `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[j]`, the new value of `dp[j]` will be the previously stored value in `dp[j]` incremented by the value in `dp[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the output of the affected variables will be:
- `dp[j]` is now `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`

Since the exact values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` are not provided, we can still express the result based on the relationship:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**.
