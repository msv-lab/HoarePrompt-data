The variable `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The other variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. The value of `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 2`. Therefore, `dp[j]` is modified based on the current value of `dp[j - 1]`. The relationship of these variables is unchanged, and their constraints continue to apply.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD`.**
