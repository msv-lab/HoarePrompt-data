The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[j]` can change due to the earlier computations where `dp[j]` was updated to `(previous dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`. However, this operation keeps `dp[j]` within the bounds of `MOD`, ensuring it doesn't exceed this value.

Since `dp[j]` is modified, the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, after executing this line, the state of the variables is as follows:

`n` retains its range as a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` remains as 1; `j` remains as `f_max_n - 2`; and `dp[j]` now has a new value which is `dp[j] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is now updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
