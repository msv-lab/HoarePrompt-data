According to the code, the loop iterates backwards from `f_max_n` down to `1`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which is the starting point for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by `1`. Therefore, `j` will be `f_max_n - 1` for the next iteration, and since `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, `j` will remain a valid index. 

Now, considering that `i` is not modified by the loop and remains `3`, along with `n` which does not change, the relevant adjustments to the state are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated based on the previous iteration's logic.**
