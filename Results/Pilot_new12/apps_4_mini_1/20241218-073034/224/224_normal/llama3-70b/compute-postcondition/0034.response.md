The expression `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. The impact of this operation is that `dp[j]` is updated while all other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 2`, the value of `dp[j]` before the operation will be replaced by `dp[j] % MOD`. 

The state of `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, and other variables remains unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`, where `dp[j]` is now the remainder when the original value of `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`.**
