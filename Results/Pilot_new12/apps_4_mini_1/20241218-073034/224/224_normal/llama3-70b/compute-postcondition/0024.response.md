To determine the output state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop and its impact on the state of the variables.

The loop iterates `f_max_n` times, decrementing `j` from `f_max_n` to `1`. In each iteration, the value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. After `f_max_n` iterations:

1. The variable `i` remains unchanged, still equal to `2`.
2. The variable `j` will finish with the value `0`, as the last iteration would be when `j` decrements to `1`.
3. `dp[j]` for each `j` from `f_max_n` down to `1` will have been modified based on their original values and the values of the corresponding `dp[j - 1]`.
4. The final values of `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` will reflect the cumulative sums of values up to `dp[f_max_n]`.

Thus, after all iterations, the relationship established is that `dp[j]` for each `j` contains updated values reflecting `dp[j]` plus the summative contributions of `dp[j - 1]` over all iterations, all computed with modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` contains final values that are the result of cumulative sums of `dp[k]` for `1 <= k <= f_max_n` each taken modulo `MOD`.**
