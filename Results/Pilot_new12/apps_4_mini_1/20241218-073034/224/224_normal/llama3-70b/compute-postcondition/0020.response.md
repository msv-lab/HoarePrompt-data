The code `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[j]` is updated based on a prior calculation in the initial conditions. However, this operation does not change the values of `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to (`dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]) % MOD; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.**
