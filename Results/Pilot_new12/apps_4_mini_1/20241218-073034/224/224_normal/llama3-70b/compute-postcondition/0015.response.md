According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements down to 1. Given that the current state indicates `j` is 0 before the loop starts, this will not allow the loop to execute since the starting value of `j` must be at least `f_max_n`. 

In summary, to ensure the loop can be executed:

1. `j` must be initialized to `f_max_n`, not 0, and it should be positive.
2. There is no need for changes to `n` or `f_max_n` since `f_max_n` is already greater than 0 as stated.
3. `i` can remain at 2 since it does not affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
