According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `n` is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^6\), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be 3, and `n` must be at least 3 (so that 3 <= n). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` contains final values that are the result of cumulative sums of `dp[k]` for `1 <= k <= f_max_n` each taken modulo `MOD`.**
