The statement `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by adding to it the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The initial state specifies that `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which must be greater than 0, but does not specify the exact value of `dp[j]` or `dp[j - 1]`. We can conclude that `j` refers to a valid index within the range of the `dp` array that is being modified.

The output state will reflect that `dp[j]` has been updated but does not specify the exact value since `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` have not been defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is now increased by the value of `dp[j - 1]`.**
