According to the given code, the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it requires `i` to take values starting from 1 up to and including `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer (with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)), the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` should be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.
- The variables `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but we can note their states.
- The `dp` list's state does not affect whether the loop executes; it will be accessed during each iteration, but its initial state is valid as is.

Thus, to summarize the necessary adjustments:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer, `MOD` is 1000000007, `i` is 1**.
