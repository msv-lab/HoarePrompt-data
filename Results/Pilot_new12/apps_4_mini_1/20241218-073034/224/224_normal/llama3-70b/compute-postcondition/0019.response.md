To analyze the impact of the code, we note that:

1. `dp[j]` is being updated with the value of `dp[j - 1]`.
2. Since `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 1`, the operation specifically updates `dp[f_max_n - 1]`.
3. The variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged in their stated conditions except for the update to `dp[j]`.

Given that `dp[j]` becomes the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, the output reflects the updated state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is updated to (`dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]) % MOD**.
