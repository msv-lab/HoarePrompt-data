According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `f_max_n`. The loop is designed to decrement `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0. After this iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must decrement by 1, meaning `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`. 

Additionally, since `f_max_n` is greater than 0, `j` must also remain greater than 0. Therefore, the states need to reflect that `j` is updated.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**
