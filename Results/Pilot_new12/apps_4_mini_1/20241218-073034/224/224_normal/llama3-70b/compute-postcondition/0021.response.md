According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `f_max_n`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `f_max_n` and decrements down to 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` as `f_max_n - 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be decremented to `f_max_n`, which means `j` would be `f_max_n` in the next iteration. 

Since the loop continues while `j` is greater than 0, we need `f_max_n` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the adjusted states would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `j` is `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is updated to (`dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]) % MOD; `dp[j]` is now `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.**
