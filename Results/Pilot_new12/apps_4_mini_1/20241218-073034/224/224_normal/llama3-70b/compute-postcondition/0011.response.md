The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. `dp[j]` will now be equal to the previous value of `dp[j]` plus the value of `dp[j - 1]`, and the operation is performed modulo `MOD`. The values of `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

The variables are:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.

The `dp` value at index `j` is updated. The previous value of `dp[j]` plus the value at `dp[j - 1]` will yield a new value for `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `(previous dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`**.
