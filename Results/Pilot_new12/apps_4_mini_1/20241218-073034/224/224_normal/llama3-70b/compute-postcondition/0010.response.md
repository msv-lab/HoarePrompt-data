According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `f_max_n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is greater than zero. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. Since `f_max_n` is greater than 0, `j` will be equal to `f_max_n - 1`, which is at least 0. For the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be decremented by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be at least equal to 0, which means `f_max_n` must be at least 1 (ensuring `j` can reach 0). If the loop executes one more time, `j` will then be `f_max_n - 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` will be the new value calculated from `(previous dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`**
