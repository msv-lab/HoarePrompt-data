According to the code, the loop is determined by the value of `j`, which starts at `f_max_n` and decreases down to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`. Since `f_max_n` must be greater than 0 and we need to execute one more iteration, in the next iteration `j` will be decremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `f_max_n - 1`.

Since the current `j` is not less than or equal to 1, `f_max_n` must also be equal to or greater than 1, as it hasn't changed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD**
