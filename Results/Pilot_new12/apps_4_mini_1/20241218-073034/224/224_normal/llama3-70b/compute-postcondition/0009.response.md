The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. Since the previous state indicates that `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, we can determine that `dp[j]` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The exact new value of `dp[j]` would depend on its previous value and the value of `dp[j - 1]`, thus making it hard to specify a concrete number, but we do know it has now been taken modulo `MOD`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State summarizes this situation holistically.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is the new value equal to `(previous dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`**.
