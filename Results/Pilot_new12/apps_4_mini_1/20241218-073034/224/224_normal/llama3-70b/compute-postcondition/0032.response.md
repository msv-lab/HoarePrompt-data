According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `f_max_n`. The loop iterates while `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `f_max_n - 1`. Therefore, on the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1, making `j` equal to `f_max_n - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than 0. This means that `f_max_n - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, which implies that `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
