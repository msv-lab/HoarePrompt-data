The given code line `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulo of `dp[j]` with the constant `MOD`. The values of all other variables remain the same. Since `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 1`, we can refer to it in terms of `f_max_n`. After executing the code, `dp[j]` changes but we do not have specific values for `dp[j]` or `MOD`. However, we are aware that `dp[j]` remains non-negative due to the modulo operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
