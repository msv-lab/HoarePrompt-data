The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]`. The variable `j` is previously defined as `f_max_n - 1`, and since `f_max_n` is greater than 0, `j` has a valid index. The previous state of `dp[j]` is updated as follows:

1. `dp[j]` was `dp[j]` before the code execution.
2. `dp[j - 1]` was the previous value of the element before updating.

Since no other variables appear to be affected, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
