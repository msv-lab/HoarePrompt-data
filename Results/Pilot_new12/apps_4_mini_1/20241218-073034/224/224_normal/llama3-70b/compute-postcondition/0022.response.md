The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. The values of `n`, `f_max_n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will highlight the new value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `j` is `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is updated to (`dp[j]` + `dp[j - 1]) % MOD,` now `dp[j]` is the new value resulting from `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
