The statement `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` indicates that the value at index `j` of the `dp` array is being updated by adding the value at index `j - 1`. In this case, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, which is derived from the initial state having `f_max_n` greater than or equal to 1.

Given that `j` is calculated as `f_max_n - 1`, we can deduce:

- `j` will be at least 0 (`f_max_n` must be at least 1).
- `dp[j]` gets updated by adding the previous value, `dp[j - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `j` is `f_max_n - 1`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
