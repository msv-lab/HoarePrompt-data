The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[j]` has been calculated as `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD`.

At this point, we know `dp[j]` has already been updated from the previous operation, and now it is simply constrained by the modulo operation. If `dp[j]` was initially `x`, after the update it will be `x % MOD`. 

The state of all other variables remains unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `j` is `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is the new value resulting from `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD,` and now `dp[j]` is equal to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
