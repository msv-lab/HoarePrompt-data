The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. This means the updated value of `dp[j]` will be between 0 (inclusive) and `MOD` (exclusive). Since `dp[j]` was previously updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, the new value of `dp[j]` will be the result of this addition reduced by modulo `MOD`. 

The states of all other variables remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % MOD`**
