The operation `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Assuming `j` is equal to `f_max_n`, and since all the other variables remain unchanged according to the preconditions, we update the output state based on the executed code. The specific value of `dp[j]` now reflects the addition of `dp[j - 1]` to its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**.
