Analyzing the provided code snippet, the impact of the line `dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)` is that it initializes the variable `dp` as a list of zeros. The size of this list is determined by the value of `f_max_n`, which is a non-negative integer. Hence, the length of the list will be `f_max_n + 1`, resulting in a list that contains `f_max_n + 1` elements, all set to zero. Additionally, the initial state of `n` and `MOD` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer, `MOD` is 1000000007, and `dp` is a list of zeros with a length of `f_max_n + 1`.**
