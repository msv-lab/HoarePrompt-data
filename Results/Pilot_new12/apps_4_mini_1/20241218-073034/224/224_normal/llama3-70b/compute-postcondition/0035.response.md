To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze how the loop affects the variables, especially focusing on how many times the loop runs based on the variable `f_max_n`.

The loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to `1`. Therefore, if `f_max_n` is `k`, the loop will execute `k` times. Each iteration updates `dp[j]` as `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` and then takes the modulo with `MOD`.

After all iterations are completed, the following will be true:
1. The variable `j` will be `0` (since the loop counts down to `1`).
2. The `dp` array will have been modified according to the cumulative sums of its values from `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]`.

To summarize, at the end:
- The final values of `dp[j]` will depend on the cumulative sums of the earlier values from `dp[1]` through `dp[f_max_n]`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
- The value `f_max_n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

Thus, the overall output state after the loop completes is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` contains the cumulative sum of `dp[k]` for `1 <= k <= f_max_n`, each taken modulo `MOD`.**
