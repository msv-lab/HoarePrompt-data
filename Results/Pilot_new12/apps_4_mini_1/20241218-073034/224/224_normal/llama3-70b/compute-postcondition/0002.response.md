The line `dp[0] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the first element of the list `dp`. The list `dp` was previously a list of zeros with a length of `f_max_n + 1`. This means after this assignment, `dp[0]` will hold the value `1` while all other elements remain `0`. All other initial conditions regarding `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, and the structure of the list `dp` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[i]` is 0 for all i from 1 to `f_max_n`.**
