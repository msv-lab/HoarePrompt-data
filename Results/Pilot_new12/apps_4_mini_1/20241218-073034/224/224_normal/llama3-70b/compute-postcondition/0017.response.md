The operation `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking its current value and performing the modulo operation with `MOD`. The initial value of `dp[j]` is updated but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**.
