According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. 

Since `n` is a positive integer in the range from 2 to \(10^6\), for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2. In this case, since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, `n` must also be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` contains values updated based on the previous values of `dp` from `dp[1]` to `dp[f_max_n]` such that `dp[k]` is the sum of `dp[k - 1]` added `f_max_n` times.**
