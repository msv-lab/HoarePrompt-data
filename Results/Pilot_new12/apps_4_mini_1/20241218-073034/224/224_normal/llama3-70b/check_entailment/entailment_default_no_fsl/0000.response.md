To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the three functions and their relation to the problem description step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires finding the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for permutations of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \), where \( f(p) \) measures the number of distinct GCDs of prefixes of the permutation. Then we need to count how many permutations yield this maximum value \( f_{max}(n) \).

### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. 
   - No issues here as the code correctly implements the GCD calculation.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum GCD obtainable from prefixes of permutations of \( \{1, 2, ..., n\} \).
   - However, the logic does not consider all permutations or their prefix GCDs; it only calculates the maximum GCD among the integers from 1 to \( n \). Thus, this does not compute \( f_{max}(n) \) in accordance with the problem description.

3. **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**:
   - This function aims to compute the number of permutations for which \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).
   - The logic used in this function assumes `f_max_n` directly relates to counts possible, but given that `func_2` may not have computed it accurately, this too could lead to incorrect outputs.

### Output and Edge Cases
The provided examples in the problem statement clarify expected outputs for specific values of \( n \):
- For \( n = 2 \): The only permutation is \( [1, 2] \), and the maximum distinct GCD is \( 1 \), matching the output as \( 1 \).
- For \( n = 3 \): There are 4 valid permutations yielding the maximum distinct counts of GCD, which is also correctly handled in the example.
- However, with \( n = 6 \) leading to an output of \( 120 \), we need to question the handling and combinations for larger \( n \).

### Conclusion
The second function does not compute \( f_{max}(n) \) accurately as it fails to consider permutation variations and their resultant distinct prefix GCDs. Therefore, there exists a gap between the implementation logic in `func_2` and the overall requirement to satisfy all potential cases.

Given that there is at least one input case (any \( n \geq 3 \)) where the computed \( f_{max}(n) \) is likely incorrect, the implementation fails to adhere to the problem conditions fully.

Correctness: **False**
