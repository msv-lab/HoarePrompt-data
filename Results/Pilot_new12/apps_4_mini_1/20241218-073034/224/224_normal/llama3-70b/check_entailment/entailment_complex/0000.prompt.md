You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It modifies the values of `a` and `b` through a loop until `b` is zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original input values. The function then returns this GCD. It does not include error handling for non-positive integers, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the inputs are not strictly positive as expected. Overall, the final state of the program is that the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `res` is equal to max(res_initial, func_1(res_initial, 1), func_1(res_initial, 2), ..., func_1(res_initial, n)); `i` is equal to n.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the maximum value among res_initial and func_1 applied to res_initial for each integer from 1 to n, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value, `res`, which is initialized to 0. It iterates through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` to `res` and the current integer `i`. The result of each call to `func_1` is compared with the current maximum (`res`), and `res` is updated accordingly. At the end of the loop, `res` contains the highest value obtained from the initial value of 0 and the results of `func_1`, which is then returned. The potential edge case is that if `func_1` is not correctly defined for all expected inputs, this may lead to unexpected results, but the function itself does not handle such errors or inconsistencies explicitly.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dp[j]` contains the final values that are the result of cumulative sums of `dp[k]` for `0 <= k <= f_max_n`, each taken modulo `MOD`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which contains the final values that are the result of cumulative sums of dp[k] for 0 <= k <= f_max_n, each taken modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n`, a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (f_max_n >= 1). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. The function then computes cumulative sums in the `dp` array such that after `n` iterations, `dp[j]` contains the number of ways to obtain `j` using integers from 0 to `n`, under the condition that each `dp[j]` is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. The final result returned is `dp[f_max_n]`, representing the number of ways to achieve a sum of `f_max_n` using the available integers. 

Edge cases include the assumption that `f_max_n` is always >= 1 as per the function's precondition, and there is no handling for scenarios where `f_max_n` could be 0 or negative due to an incorrect input which may lead to index issues. In summary, the function effectively computes the number of ways to sum to `f_max_n` given the constraints of using numbers up to `n`, and properly handles large numbers through modular arithmetic.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
