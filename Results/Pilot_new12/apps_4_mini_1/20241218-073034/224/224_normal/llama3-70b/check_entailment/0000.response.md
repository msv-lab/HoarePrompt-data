To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze each function and their interactions according to the definition of \( f(p) \) and \( f_{max}(n) \).

Here's a breakdown of the functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This function appears to be correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function aims to compute the maximum GCD value for prefixes of a permutation from 1 to \( n \). However, it doesn't consider all permutations nor does it correctly compute \( f_{max}(n) \). As a result, it will not necessarily yield a proper maximum GCD for permutations of the integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function tries to compute the count of permutations that yield \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \) by utilizing dynamic programming. However, without the correct implementation of `func_2`, this function would not have the correct \( f_{max}(n) \) value to work with.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum GCDs**:
   - The permutations are not considered adequately in `func_2`, thus the maximum GCD computed could be wrong.
   
- **Dependence on `func_2` Results**:
   - The result returned by `func_3` is dependent on the potentially incorrect output from `func_2`. This means that any case where `func_2` fails to correctly compute \( f_{max}(n) \) will propagate to `func_3`, leading to an ultimately incorrect output.

### Cases to Consider:
Let's take \( n = 4 \) as a potential test case:
- The expected \( f_{max}(4) \) should be calculated from all \( 4! = 24 \) permutations. The number of permutations yielding a maximum distinct GCDs calculated incorrectly will result in an incorrect count being returned.

Since I can demonstrate that there are cases where the functions will yield incorrect outcomes due to the issues highlighted, I conclude that the program does not meet the requirements correctly as outlined by the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
