You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Functions with output description for each function:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It modifies the values of `a` and `b` through a loop until `b` is zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original input values. The function then returns this GCD. It does not include error handling for non-positive integers, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the inputs are not strictly positive as expected. Overall, the final state of the program is that the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value, `res`, which is initialized to 0. It iterates through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` to `res` and the current integer `i`. The result of each call to `func_1` is compared with the current maximum (`res`), and `res` is updated accordingly. At the end of the loop, `res` contains the highest value obtained from the initial value of 0 and the results of `func_1`, which is then returned. The potential edge case is that if `func_1` is not correctly defined for all expected inputs, this may lead to unexpected results, but the function itself does not handle such errors or inconsistencies explicitly.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
    return dp[f_max_n]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n`, a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (f_max_n >= 1). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. The function then computes cumulative sums in the `dp` array such that after `n` iterations, `dp[j]` contains the number of ways to obtain `j` using integers from 0 to `n`, under the condition that each `dp[j]` is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. The final result returned is `dp[f_max_n]`, representing the number of ways to achieve a sum of `f_max_n` using the available integers. 

Edge cases include the assumption that `f_max_n` is always >= 1 as per the function's precondition, and there is no handling for scenarios where `f_max_n` could be 0 or negative due to an incorrect input which may lead to index issues. In summary, the function effectively computes the number of ways to sum to `f_max_n` given the constraints of using numbers up to `n`, and properly handles large numbers through modular arithmetic.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
