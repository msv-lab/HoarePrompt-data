To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and output hints, let's analyze each function step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Functions

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The output hints correctly describe this function's behavior and it handles the expected input correctly.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
   - This function initializes `res` to 0 and loops through numbers from 1 to `n`, applying `func_1` with `res` and the current number `i`. It aims to find the maximum GCD of the prefix of permutations. However, logically, the maximum GCD possible with all permutations of numbers from 1 through `n` should be `n` itself when we start with `1` and end with `n`. Since we're not actually iterating through permutations, but finding the maximum accumulative GCD in a sorted manner (1 to n), the logic does not correlate directly to the problem's requirement of analyzing distinct GCD values across all permutations.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**
   - This function is designed to compute the number of ways to obtain a sum of `f_max_n`. However, it erroneously calculates counts using dynamic programming in a way that does not correlate to the distinct GCD values relevant to the problem description. The logic implemented here misinterprets the requirements, as it's counting combinations rather than determining permutations of distinct elements.

### Key Issues Identified
- The output hints of **Function 2** imply that we are supposed to consider the maximum distinct GCD values obtained through **all permutations**. The algorithm implemented does not correctly account for this. 
- The description expects permutations that reach the maximum distinct GCD, which is not being accurately counted through the current implementation.
- **Function 3** compounds this mistake by treating `f_max_n` incorrectly in relation to permutations instead of treating it as a measure of distinct GCDs derived from the permutations.

### Conclusion
Since the program as a whole does not adhere to the problem description due to logical shortcomings in calculating the maximum distinct GCD values from all permutations and consequently the counts of those permutations, the program is considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
