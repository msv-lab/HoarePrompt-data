To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to verify whether it accurately computes the number of permutations of integers \(1\) to \(n\) such that \(f(p)\) equals the maximum value \(f_{max}(n)\).

### Summary of the Problem Requirements:
1. Define function \(f(p)\): based on the distinct GCD values of the prefixes of a permutation.
2. Compute the maximum \(f_{max}(n)\) among all permutations of \(1, 2, \ldots, n\).
3. Count permutations \(p\) for which \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\).
4. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Evaluation of Code Functions:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function computes the maximum GCD of prefixes of permutations of integers from \(1\) to \(n\). However, it simply returns the GCD of all numbers up to \(n\), which is always \(1\) for permutations of numbers \(1\) through \(n\), so it does not actually compute the distinct values of prefixes as described. This deviation from the requirement to properly calculate distinct GCDs alerts us to a potential flaw.

3. **`func_3(n, f_max_n)`**: This function seems to be intended to count the number of permutations of \(1\) to \(n\) where \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\). However, without the correct input for \(f_{max}(n)\), counting permutations based solely on the computed maximum GCD from `func_2` is flawed.

### Investigation of Potential Edge Cases:
- For \(n = 2\):
   - the only permutation is \([1, 2]\) which gives \(f(p) = 1\) and \(f_{max}(2) = 1\) leading to the correct count of \(1\).
- For \(n = 3\):
   - The permutations \( [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]\) produce variations in \(f(p)\) leading to maximum \(f_{max}(3) = 2\) with \(4\) counts.  Thus could lead to the correct output.
- For \(n = 6\):
   - The challenge lies in validating more explicitly computed values of \(f(p)\) across varying permutations and evaluating maximum counts of valid outputs. 

However, the fundamental flaw is in `func_2`, which does not follow the problem description expectations by not adequately handling distinct GCD values of prefixes of permutations, leading to incorrect calculations of \(f_{max}(n)\). 

### Conclusion:
Given that the logic in the function attempting to compute \(f_{max}(n)\) does not follow the description's requirement—missing the check for distinct elements and not managing combinations/counting correctly— the overall implementation does not satisfy correctness.

Correctness: **False**
