The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n`, a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (f_max_n >= 1). It initializes a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. The function then computes cumulative sums in the `dp` array such that after `n` iterations, `dp[j]` contains the number of ways to obtain `j` using integers from 0 to `n`, under the condition that each `dp[j]` is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. The final result returned is `dp[f_max_n]`, representing the number of ways to achieve a sum of `f_max_n` using the available integers. 

Edge cases include the assumption that `f_max_n` is always >= 1 as per the function's precondition, and there is no handling for scenarios where `f_max_n` could be 0 or negative due to an incorrect input which may lead to index issues. In summary, the function effectively computes the number of ways to sum to `f_max_n` given the constraints of using numbers up to `n`, and properly handles large numbers through modular arithmetic.
