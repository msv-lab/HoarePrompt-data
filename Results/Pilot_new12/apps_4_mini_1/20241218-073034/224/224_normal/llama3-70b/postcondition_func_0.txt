The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It modifies the values of `a` and `b` through a loop until `b` is zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original input values. The function then returns this GCD. It does not include error handling for non-positive integers, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the inputs are not strictly positive as expected. Overall, the final state of the program is that the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.
