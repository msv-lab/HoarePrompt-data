The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes the maximum value, `res`, which is initialized to 0. It iterates through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` to `res` and the current integer `i`. The result of each call to `func_1` is compared with the current maximum (`res`), and `res` is updated accordingly. At the end of the loop, `res` contains the highest value obtained from the initial value of 0 and the results of `func_1`, which is then returned. The potential edge case is that if `func_1` is not correctly defined for all expected inputs, this may lead to unexpected results, but the function itself does not handle such errors or inconsistencies explicitly.
