#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and computes the sum of its digits. It converts the integer to a string to iterate over each digit, converts them back to integers, and returns their sum. The final state after execution is that the program will return a non-negative integer representing the sum of the digits of n. There are additional considerations such as ensuring n is constrained to the specified range, as any value outside this range or negative input is not handled and could lead to incorrect usage without error handling.
