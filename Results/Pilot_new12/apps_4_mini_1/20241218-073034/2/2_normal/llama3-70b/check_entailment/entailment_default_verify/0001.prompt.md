You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(i)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
    print(max_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program has a flaw that makes it incorrect for certain values of `x`. Specifically, it iterates through every integer from 1 to `x` and calculates the sum of digits for each. However, it does not optimize to check numbers which are close to `x` but have smaller digit sums due to the formation of the digits.

For instance, if `x = 1000`, the sum of the digits for `1000` is `1`, and the maximum sum of digits for any number less than or equal to `1000` is `999`, which has a digit sum of `27`. The program would produce `1000`, which is incorrect.

Additionally, for larger numbers, the maximum digit sum is often achieved by a number comprised of all `9`s just below that number (like `999`, `99999`, etc.), especially when `x` is a power of ten or just above it.

The program should instead look for numbers made mostly of `9`s or should leverage properties of numbers rather than iterating through all possible integers. Hence, it would fail for values like `1000`, and the correct answer should be `999`. 

Thus, the program is not handling all cases accurately.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `x` from user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^18`. It calculates the maximum digit sum of all integers from 1 to `x` and identifies the first integer (from 1 to `x`) that has this maximum digit sum. After processing all numbers, the function prints the integer that has the maximum digit sum. Notably, the function does not handle input validation or scenarios where `x` is outside the specified range, which could lead to undefined behavior or errors in practical use.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
