The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_num`. The value of `i` is currently 3, so `max_num` will be updated to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is 3; `max_num` is 3; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3**
