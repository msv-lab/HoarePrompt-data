The code snippet `print(max_num)` outputs the value of `max_num`. The values of `x`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` are not changed by this operation. Since `max_num` is the number whose digit sum is `max_sum`, it retains its information from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18; `max_sum` is the maximum digit sum of any number from 1 to `x`; `max_num` is the number whose digit sum is `max_sum`, and the value of `max_num` is returned in the output.**
