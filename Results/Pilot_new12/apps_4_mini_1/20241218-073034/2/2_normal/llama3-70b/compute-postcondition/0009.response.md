According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, thus `i` will become 2. 

Since `i` is currently 1, and it needs to be less than or equal to `x` (which is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 1), there are no changes needed for `x`. Therefore, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain at their previous values, and `i` is updated for the next iteration.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, and `digit_sum` is 1**
