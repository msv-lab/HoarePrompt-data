In the given code snippet, `max_num` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state has `i` equal to 1. Therefore, `max_num` now takes on this value.

The variables `x`, `max_sum`, `digit_sum` remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Given that:
- `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\)
- `max_sum` is 1
- `max_num` becomes 1 (from the value of `i`)
- `i` is 1
- `digit_sum` is 1

The output state updates only the value of `max_num`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 1, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
