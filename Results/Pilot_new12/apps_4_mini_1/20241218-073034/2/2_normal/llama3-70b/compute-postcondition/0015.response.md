To calculate the value of `digit_sum`, we first convert `i` (which is 3) to a string, then iterate through each character (digit), convert it back to an integer, and take the sum. The only digit here is '3', so:

- `digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(3)) = sum(int('3')) = 3`

We now know that `digit_sum` is 3. 

Now let's compare `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `max_sum` is currently 2, and `digit_sum` (which is 3) is greater than `max_sum`, the condition (`digit_sum > max_sum`) is true, and `i` remains 3.

None of the other variables (`x`, `max_sum`, `max_num`) are affected by this assignment, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is 2; `max_num` is 2; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3.**
