Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `x` from user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^18`. It calculates the maximum digit sum of all integers from 1 to `x` and identifies the first integer (from 1 to `x`) that has this maximum digit sum. After processing all numbers, the function prints the integer that has the maximum digit sum. Notably, the function does not handle input validation or scenarios where `x` is outside the specified range, which could lead to undefined behavior or errors in practical use.**
