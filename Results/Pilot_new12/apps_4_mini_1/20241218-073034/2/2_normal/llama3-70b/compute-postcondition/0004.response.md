The code calculates the digit sum of the integer `i`, which is currently `1`. The digit sum is obtained by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers. Since `i` is `1`, the digit sum will be `1`.

After running the code, the value of `digit_sum` will be `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
