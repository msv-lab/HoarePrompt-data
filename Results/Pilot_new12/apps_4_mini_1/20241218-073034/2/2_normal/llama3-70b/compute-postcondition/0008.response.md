Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, and `digit_sum` is 1. If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is set to 1, `max_num` is set to 1, and `i` remains 1; otherwise, the values of `max_sum`, `max_num`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
