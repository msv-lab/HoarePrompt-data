To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the code and the initial state provided along with the context of how the variables interact during the loop execution.

The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `x`. For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`digit_sum`). During the iterations:
- If `digit_sum` surpasses `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum`, and `max_num` is updated to `i`.
- If `digit_sum` does not surpass `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain the same.
  
The maximum digit sum of any number between 1 and `x` will be determined by the highest number `i` that achieves this maximum digit sum. The maximum digit sum occurs when all digits are as high as possible, such as in the numbers with repeated digits (like 999...999).

After all iterations:
- `max_sum` will be equal to the maximum digit sum observed for all integers from 1 to `x`.
- `max_num` will be the first integer found that attains this `max_sum`.

For example, the maximum `digit_sum` possible occurs with the number composed mostly of 9s. 

If `x` = 1, then:
- The loop will execute only once, where the digit sum is 1, resulting in `max_sum` = 1 and `max_num` = 1.

If `x` = 9, then:
- The highest digit sum of 9 will be at `i` = 9, resulting in `max_sum` = 9 and `max_num` = 9.

If `x` = 10:
- The highest digit sum remains to be 9 at `i` = 9.

As `x` increases up to 10^18, `digit_sum` can be maximized typically with numbers like 999999999999... and will reach at least 9 when `x` is large enough.

Lastly, if `x` is 1, `max_sum` is 1, and `max_num` is 1, with all other values remaining unchanged.

Generalizing the output state:
- For all `1 <= x <= 10^18`, the maximum digit sum achievable is 162 when `x` has all nine digits, achieving the maximum possible digit contributions from any numerals.

Thus, the output state reflects this understanding. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is the maximum digit sum of any number from 1 to `x`, `max_num` is the number whose digit sum is `max_sum`.**
