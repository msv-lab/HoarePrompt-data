The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous state shows that `max_sum` is already `0`. Since `max_num` is initialized without affecting other variables, the output state retains all original conditions apart from the newly assigned value of `max_num`. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0**
