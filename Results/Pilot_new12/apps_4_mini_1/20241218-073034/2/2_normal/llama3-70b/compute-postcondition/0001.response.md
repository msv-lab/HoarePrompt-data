The variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0. The variable `x` retains its previous state as a positive integer within the range from 1 to 10^18. Therefore, other variables are not affected, so the Output State will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 0**
