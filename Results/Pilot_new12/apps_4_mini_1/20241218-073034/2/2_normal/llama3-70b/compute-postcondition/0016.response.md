`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The previous value of `digit_sum` is 3, so `max_sum` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is 3; `max_num` is 2; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `max_sum` is 3; `max_num` is 2; `i` is 3; `digit_sum` is 3.**
