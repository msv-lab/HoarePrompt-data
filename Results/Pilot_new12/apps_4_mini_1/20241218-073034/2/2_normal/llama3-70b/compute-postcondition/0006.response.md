The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. Since the initial state states that `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` will now be equal to the value of `digit_sum`, which is 1.

Examining the remaining variables:
- `x` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\)
- `max_num` remains 0
- `i` remains 1
- The value of `digit_sum` is still 1

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**.
