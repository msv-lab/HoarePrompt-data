The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Initially, `max_sum` is 0, and `digit_sum` is 2. Therefore, after the assignment, `max_sum` will be updated to 2. The values of `x`, `max_num`, `i`, and the original value of `digit_sum` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
