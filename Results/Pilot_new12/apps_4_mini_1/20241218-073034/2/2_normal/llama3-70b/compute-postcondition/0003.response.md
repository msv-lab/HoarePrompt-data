According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `x`. The range function `range(1, x + 1)` indicates that the loop will iterate from 1 to `x`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since it is stated that `x` is a positive integer (1 <= `x` <= 10^18).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will take on the value of `x + 1` when the loop terminates. Since the loop is defined to start at 1, the initial value of `i` when the loop first executes will be 1. 

Thus, we have:

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1**
