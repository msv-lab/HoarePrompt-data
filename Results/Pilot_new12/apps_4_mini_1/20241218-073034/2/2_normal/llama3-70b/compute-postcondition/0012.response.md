The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_num`. In this case, since the initial value of `i` is 2, `max_num` will now also be 2. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
