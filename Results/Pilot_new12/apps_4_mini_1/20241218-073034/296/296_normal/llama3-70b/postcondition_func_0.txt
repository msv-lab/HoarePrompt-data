The function reads a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9) from user input. If `n` is equal to 2, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, it outputs 'YES', followed by the integer '2', and then outputs '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`. There are no return values, as the function solely prints output based on the condition of `n`. It does not handle any other cases, such as when `n` is less than 2, which may lead to undefined behavior since inputs are expected to fall within the provided range.
