The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the input integer `n` is equal to 2. If it is, the program outputs "NO" since there can't be any valid fractions according to the problem's requirements. For any `n` greater than 2, it outputs "YES" and prints two fractions: `1/(n//2)` and `1/n`.

However, the logic of the program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for n > 2**: The fractions generated by the logic do not always satisfy the conditions that `b_i` divides `n` and that `1 < b_i < n`. The integer `n` itself cannot be a denominator of any fraction according to the problem's restrictions, yet the program produces `1 n`, which is invalid.

2. **Missing Check for Valid Fractions**: The solution does not take into account the requirement that `b_i` must be a divisor of `n`. For example, if `n = 4`, the generated output would incorrectly include the fraction `1/4`, which does not satisfy the condition of `1 < b_i < n`.

3. **Failure to Address All Cases**: The program only specifically checks for `n = 2` and does not consider other values of `n`, particularly those which may not yield valid fractions satisfying the summation condition outlined in the problem.

Given these deficiencies, the program does not produce correct results for all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it fails when `n` is greater than 2, as it will not check whether the denominators `n//2` and `n` satisfy the conditions.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
