Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Outcome for n = 2:** 
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" for `n = 2`, which is aligned with the problem statement, as it indicates that no valid fractions can be formed.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Valid Cases (n > 2):**
   - For any `n > 2`, the program outputs "YES", `k = 2`, and assumes the fractions will always be `1` over `n // 2` and `1` over `n`. 
   - However, according to the problem description, the fractions must meet specific conditions: both denominators must divide `n`, should be in the range `1 < b_i < n`, and the sum of the fractions must equal `1 - 1/n`. 

3. **Example Error:**
   - For `n = 4`, the program will output:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 2
     1 4
     ```
     - Here, `1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4`, which does not satisfy the requirement `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`.
   - For `n = 6`, it will output fragments that meet the conditions but does not systematically produce valid fractions for all `n`.

4. **General Case Wrong Calculation:**
   - The program lacks a thorough method for checking which denominators divide `n`, and it doesn't ensure that the fractions meet the sum condition for all `n > 2`. It arbitrarily picks `n // 2` and `n` which will not hold true overall.

Thus, the program fails to reliably produce the correct set of fractions according to the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct for all potential inputs within the specified range.
