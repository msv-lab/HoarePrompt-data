You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem for all possible inputs. 

For example, let's consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to find positive integer fractions `a_i/b_i` such that:

1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
2. \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).
3. \( \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{3}{4} \).

The divisors of \( n = 4 \) that satisfy the first condition are \( b_1 = 2 \). The only possible \( a_1 \) is \( 1 \), giving us the fraction \( \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the sequence can be formed as \( \frac{1}{2} \).

However, the program hard-codes the output for \( n = 2 \) to "NO" and does not handle appropriately the cases for \( n \) being other values. For \( n = 4 \), the program would output "YES" with the hard-coded values since it only checks if \( n = 2 \). 

Moreover, for larger values of \( n \) beyond the hard-coded implementation, the logic provided is insufficient to determine the fractions needed, making it incorrect for many cases where \( n \) permits a valid sequence.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it does not adhere to the problem requirements in every instance.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9. If `n` is equal to 2, the output is 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, the output is '1' followed by `n`, and `k` is set to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9) from user input. If `n` is equal to 2, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, it outputs 'YES', followed by the integer '2', and then outputs '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`. There are no return values, as the function solely prints output based on the condition of `n`. It does not handle any other cases, such as when `n` is less than 2, which may lead to undefined behavior since inputs are expected to fall within the provided range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
