The program reads a positive integer \( n \) from user input. It checks if \( n \) is equal to 2, and if so, it outputs 'NO', indicating that there is no valid sequence of fractions that can be formed per the problem description. However, for any \( n \) greater than 2, it always outputs 'YES', followed by the integer '2' and the fractions \( \frac{1}{(n/2)} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \).

Upon examining the provided details, we can see where the logic fails:

1. The problem states that the denominators \( b_i \) must be divisors of \( n \) such that \( 1 < b_i < n \). However, for \( n > 2 \):
   - The function outputs \( b_1 = n // 2 \) and \( b_2 = n \). The value \( b_2 = n \) does not satisfy the condition \( b_i < n \).
   
2. Additionally, for certain values of \( n \) greater than 2 that are prime (like \( n = 3, 5, 7, ... \)), the only divisors are 1 and \( n \), and so it is impossible to form any \( b_i \) based on the requirements laid out in the problem. The program does not account for these cases correctly and fails to check for the variety of possible values of \( n \) greater than 2.

For example, if the input is \( n = 3 \):
- The expected output should be 'NO', as there are no valid divisors that meet the conditions. However, the program will output 'YES', which is incorrect.

Given these observed issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
