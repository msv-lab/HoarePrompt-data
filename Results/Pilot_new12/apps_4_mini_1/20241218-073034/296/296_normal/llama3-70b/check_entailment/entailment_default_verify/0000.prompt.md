You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to carefully analyze the requirements and the implementation. 

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to create a sequence of fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \) (the input integer), and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
2. \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).
3. The sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

### Program Review
The provided program checks if the input integer \( n \) is equal to 2. If so, it prints "NO" since there are no possible fractions that can fulfill the requirements (the only divisor is 2 itself, which does not comply with \( 1 < b_i < n \)).

For any \( n > 2 \), the program prints "YES", outputs the number of fractions \( k \) as 2, and then incorrectly outputs the fractions \( \frac{1}{n // 2} \) and \( \frac{1}{n} \). 

### Correctness Check
1. **Case of n = 2**: The program correctly outputs "NO".
2. **Case of n = 3**: 
   - Possible divisor \( b_i = 3 \) but \( 1 < b_i < 3 \) leaves no valid \( b_i \) (the only divisor, which is itself). The output should be "NO".
3. **Case of n = 4**:
   - The divisors are 2. Only valid option gives \( b_i = 2 \) yielding \( a_i = 1 \) (which would work).
   - The sum of fractions \( \frac{1}{2} \) equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which does not satisfy the condition.
4. **Case of n = 6**: 
   - The divisors are 2 and 3. The fractions \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \) do correctly satisfy \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} \).  
   
The problem arises because after evaluating a few cases we discover that the fractions provided by the program do not always satisfy the mathematical requirement outlined, especially for \( n = 3 \) (or larger even values). 

**Example Case Finding:**
Let's test it with \( n = 3 \):
- Expected output: "NO" because there are no valid \( b_i \).
- Actual output: "YES", \( k = 2 \), \( 1 1 \), \( 1 3 \).

Therefore, for \( n = 3 \), it incorrectly returns "YES" and gives invalid fractions. 

### Conclusion
The program does not consistently provide the correct output for all potential inputs as outlined in the problem description, particularly for \( n = 3 \). 

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9) from user input. If `n` is equal to 2, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, it outputs 'YES', followed by the integer '2', and then outputs '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`. There are no return values, as the function solely prints output based on the condition of `n`. It does not handle any other cases, such as when `n` is less than 2, which may lead to undefined behavior since inputs are expected to fall within the provided range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
