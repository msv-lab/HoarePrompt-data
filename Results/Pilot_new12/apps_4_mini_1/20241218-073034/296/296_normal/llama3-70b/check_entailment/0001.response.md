Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem for all possible inputs. 

For example, let's consider the input `n = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to find positive integer fractions `a_i/b_i` such that:

1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \) and \( 1 < b_i < n \).
2. \( 1 \leq a_i < b_i \).
3. \( \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} = \frac{3}{4} \).

The divisors of \( n = 4 \) that satisfy the first condition are \( b_1 = 2 \). The only possible \( a_1 \) is \( 1 \), giving us the fraction \( \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the sequence can be formed as \( \frac{1}{2} \).

However, the program hard-codes the output for \( n = 2 \) to "NO" and does not handle appropriately the cases for \( n \) being other values. For \( n = 4 \), the program would output "YES" with the hard-coded values since it only checks if \( n = 2 \). 

Moreover, for larger values of \( n \) beyond the hard-coded implementation, the logic provided is insufficient to determine the fractions needed, making it incorrect for many cases where \( n \) permits a valid sequence.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it does not adhere to the problem requirements in every instance.
