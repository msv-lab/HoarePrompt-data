`k` is assigned the value `2`. The initial state of `n` remains the same as it has not been altered by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `k` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `k` is 2**.
