The code snippet provided will print 'NO' to the output. However, it does not change any variables or their states in the program. The previous state of `n` remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is equal to 2; the output is 'NO'.**
