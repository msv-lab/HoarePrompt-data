The code snippet simply prints the value of `k`, which is already defined as 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and since the code only prints a value without altering any variables, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `k` is 2**
