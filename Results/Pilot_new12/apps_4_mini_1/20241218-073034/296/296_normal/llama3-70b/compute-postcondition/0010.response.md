The function `func` does not accept any input parameters as defined in the provided signature. Given the constraints, it asserts that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since `n` is not passed as an argument to the function but is likely managed internally, we cannot specify its behavior in relation to input parameters. The problem does not provide any explicit output or return behavior associated with these constraints or the internal workings of the function.

Given the lack of input parameters and the absence of clear output specifications in the example provided, we can only conclude that the function operates within the bounds of the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is undefined based on the provided information.**
