The code appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. The variable `i` was previously incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being equal to its previous value plus 1. The value of `divisors` now includes this incremented value of `i`. 

The result after executing the code will depend on the current value of `n` and the incremented value of `i`. The output will show `divisors` now includes the new value `n // i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `divisors` now includes the value `n // i`.**
