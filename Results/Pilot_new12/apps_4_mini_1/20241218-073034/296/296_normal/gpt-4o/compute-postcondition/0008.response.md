The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the `divisors` list. Since `n` is a positive integer that ranges from 2 to 10^9, and `i` is currently 2, `n // i` evaluates to `n // 2`. The given condition states that `i` is not equal to `n // i`, ensuring `n` is not an even number since `i` is equal to 2. Therefore, `n // 2` is a valid calculation. The previous values of the affected variables are maintained, and we will only update the `divisors` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is currently 2, `divisors` includes 2 and `n // 2` value has been appended to `divisors`.**
