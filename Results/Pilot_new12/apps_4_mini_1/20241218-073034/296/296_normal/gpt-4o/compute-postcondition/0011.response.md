According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the calculated limit based on `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, and `i` is the current iteration value starting from 2. Since the loop checks for `i` in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, we need to determine if `i` will fit within that range for the next execution.

1. We start with `i` at its current value.
2. `i` will be incremented by 1 at the beginning of the next iteration.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, it must be true that the value of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Thus, `i` must be increased by 1, and for the condition to hold, `n` must be such that `n` is large enough for the square root to be greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the conditions adjust as follows:
- The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The state of `n` must satisfy the constraint such that when `i` is incremented, it remains less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is updated to `i + 1` within the limits that ensure `i` can still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`**
