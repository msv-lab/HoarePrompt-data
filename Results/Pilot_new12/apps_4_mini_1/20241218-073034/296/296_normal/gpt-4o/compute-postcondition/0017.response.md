The code operation `divisors.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the `divisors` list. The initial state specifies that `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, we need to consider the precondition that `i` was incremented before this operation.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^9` and `n` is greater than 2, the state of other variables remains valid. The only changes take place in `i` and `divisors`.

Since `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, the new value of `i` is 1 more than its previous value. The exact previous value is not provided, thus we can only describe the state in terms of `i`.

We can assume that the list `divisors` is already defined and we are now appending the new value of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and the value `i` is appended to the `divisors` list.**
