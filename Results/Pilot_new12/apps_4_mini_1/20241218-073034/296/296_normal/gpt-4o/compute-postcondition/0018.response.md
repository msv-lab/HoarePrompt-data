The code appends the value of `n // i` to the `divisors` list. The value of `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2. The variable `i` has just been incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, the output state after executing the code will reflect the new built values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `divisors` now includes `n // (i - 1)` (the value of `i` before incrementing)**.
