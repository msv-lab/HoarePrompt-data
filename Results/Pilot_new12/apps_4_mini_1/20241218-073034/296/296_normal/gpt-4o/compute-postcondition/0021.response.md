After analyzing the given information and the provided loop, here is the output state for the program.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and n is greater than 2; `divisors` is an empty list.

In the loop, `i` iterates from 2 up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. For every `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i`, `i` and `n // i` (if they are distinct) will be appended to the `divisors` list. 

If `n` is prime, the loop will find no divisors and `divisors` will remain empty. If `n` is composite, all pairs of divisors less than `math.sqrt(n)` will be added to `divisors`.

Therefore, the conditions for the state of the variables after all iterations of the loop will be as follows:

Output State: **`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. If `n` is prime, `divisors` will be empty.**
