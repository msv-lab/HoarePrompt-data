Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9). It returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or if `n` is a prime number (indicated by no divisors being found excluding `n` itself). If `n` has divisors, the function returns 'YES', followed by the count of those divisors `k`, and a list of fractions represented as tuples `(1, d)` for each divisor `d`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is exactly 2 or 3 (both return 'NO') and efficiently evaluates divisibility for larger values of `n` up to the specified upper bound.**
