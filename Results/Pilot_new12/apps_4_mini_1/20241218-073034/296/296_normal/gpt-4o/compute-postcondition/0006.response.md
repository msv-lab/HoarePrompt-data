The code snippet `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `i` is initialized to 2, the value being appended to `divisors` is 2. The initial state of `n` remains valid, and `divisors` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `divisors` includes 2**
