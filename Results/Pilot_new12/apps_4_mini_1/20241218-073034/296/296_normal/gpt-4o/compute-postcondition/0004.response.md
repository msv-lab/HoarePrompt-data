According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once (with `i` starting at 2). 

Before the loop, `divisors` is an empty list, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Additionally, `i` will start at 2. 

For the loop to be executed, we need to confirm the initial state of `i` and ensure that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, as given. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and n is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
