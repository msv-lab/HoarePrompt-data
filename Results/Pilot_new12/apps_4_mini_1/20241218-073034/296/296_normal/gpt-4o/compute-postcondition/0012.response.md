The code appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The variable `i` was previously updated to `i + 1`, and since `i` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, it holds a valid value within the defined constraints.

The states of all other variables remain unaffected, and the specific value of `i` is retained in `divisors`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2; `i` is equal to `i + 1`, and `divisors` now includes the value of `i`.**
