The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 'NO'. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns 'NO' as well, indicating that there are no divisors of `n` excluding `n` itself. If `n` has divisors, the function returns 'YES' followed by the number of divisors `k` (which is the count of elements in the list of divisors) and a list of fractions as tuples (1, d) for each divisor `d` in the list of divisors. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, check its properties regarding being prime or having divisors, and return an appropriate message along with relevant information about its divisors. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or if `n` is prime. If `n` has divisors, it returns 'YES' followed by the number of divisors and a list of fractions as tuples for each divisor.**
