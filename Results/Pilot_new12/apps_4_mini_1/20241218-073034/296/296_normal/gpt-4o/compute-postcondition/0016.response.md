According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the square root of `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and since the loop starts at `i = 2`, we need to consider the next value of `i`. If `n` was divisible by `i`, it would have been added to `divisors`, and `i` would be incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must just have been incremented, which means it is now `i + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the square of this new value of `i`.

Thus:
- The new value of `i` is `i + 1`, and it needs to satisfy the condition for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`**
