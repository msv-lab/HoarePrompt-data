The provided program intends to find a sequence of fractions meeting specific criteria based on the integer input \( n \). 

The code defines a function `func_1(n)` which is supposed to do the following:

1. Return 'NO' if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2.
2. Return 'NO' if \( n \) is a prime number, since a prime number has no divisors other than itself and 1.
3. If \( n \) has divisors in the range \( (1, n) \) (specifically from 2 up to \( n//2 \)), it gathers these divisors and forms fractions of the form \( \frac{1}{d} \) for each divisor \( d \).
4. It then returns 'YES', the count of divisors, and the fractions.

The program suggests that it correctly handles edge cases where \( n = 2 \) or \( n = 3 \) (returning 'NO'), which is valid according to the problem description.

However, the crucial flaw lies in the condition that is supposed to check if \( n \) is a prime number. The check for a prime number is done by looking for divisors only up to \( \sqrt{n} \), but the program does not explicitly check if any divisors were found; it only checks the `divisors` list after populating it. 

Additionally, the program incorrectly assumes that if there are no divisors found in the range (2 to \( \sqrt{n} \)), then \( n \) is a prime. While this is generally correct, the implication in the context of forming fractions is not well-handled, particularly if \( n \) has divisors like \( n - 1 \) (which are valid if \( n \) is not prime, but are not included in the current search methodology). Thus, certain composite numbers may be misidentified under various conditions.

For instance:
- If you supply a number like 4, the output is correct; however, the method used does not guarantee identifying valid divisors every time, depending on the range of checks.
- Testing with larger primes or certain composites might return incomplete or misleading results.

Ultimately, given that it does not universally ensure a correct assessment of divisors, this leads to failure to meet the problem's requirements across all potential cases, meaning the function may fail to produce expected outputs under certain conditions.

Therefore, based on these considerations, the Correctness verdict for the implementation is:

Correctness: **False**.
