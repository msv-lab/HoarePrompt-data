You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it properly identifies the sequence of fractions that satisfies the stated conditions.

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**: 
   - We need to produce fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:
     - \( b_i \) divides \( n \), \( 1 < b_i < n \)
     - \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \)
     - The sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The first relevant line checks the value of \( n \). If \( n <= 2 \), it returns "NO". This is correct because for \( n = 2 \), the only possible \( b_i \) value would be 2, which does not satisfy \( 1 < b_i < n \).
   - It then gathers the divisors of \( n \) that are between 1 and \( n \) (but excludes both). This part collects valid denominators \( b_i \).
   - If no divisors are found that satisfy the condition, it returns "NO".
   - If divisors are found, it constructs the fractions with \( a_i = 1 \) (the smallest valid numerator) for each divisor \( b_i \) and outputs the sequence.

3. **Potential Cases**:
   - An example where the program could fail is if \( n \) is a prime number greater than 2, like 5. The only divisors between 1 and \( n \) of 5 are none (only 1 and 5, both excluded). The program would return "NO" which is correct according to the specifications.
   - However, consider \( n = 4 \). The divisors are 2 (since \( 4 % 2 == 0 \)). Thus the program would output the sequence \( \frac{1}{2} \) which sums to \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). Here, the output is incorrect because \( 1/2 \) does not meet the summation requirement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   There are viable inputs where the fractions computed do not sum to the required total of \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). The logic only collects divisors but does not ensure that the sum of fractions meets the required condition in every case. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' because the current value of n is less than or equal to 2, and n is a positive integer within the specified range.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is greater than 2.
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. If `n` is prime, `divisors` will be empty.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' indicating that n is a prime number, as the current value of divisors is empty, meaning there are no divisors of n excluding n itself.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. Additionally, `divisors` is not empty, indicating that `n` is not prime.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns 'YES' followed by the number of divisors `k`, where `k` is the number of elements in the list `divisors`, and then a list of fractions as tuples (1, d) for each divisor d in `divisors`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
