To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's examine the logic step by step.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads a positive integer `n` from input.

2. **Initial Condition**:
    - If `n <= 2`, the program immediately returns 'NO'. (This is correct, since for `n = 2`, there are no valid divisors in the range required).

3. **Divisor Calculation**:
    - The program identifies divisors of `n` in the range (2, n) using trial division up to `sqrt(n)`.
    - It collects these divisors in a list called `divisors`.

4. **Checking Divisor List**:
    - If no divisors are found, it returns 'NO'.
    - If there are divisors, it proceeds to generate fractions of the form \( \frac{1}{b_i} \) for each divisor \( b_i \).

5. **Fraction Construction**:
    - The number of fractions \( k \) is determined by the length of the list of divisors.
    - The resulting output format specifies 'YES', followed by \( k \) and the actual fractions.

### Issue Identification

The output of the program is 'YES' only when there are divisors, which are collected and transformed into corresponding fractions. However, there's a flaw in the logic:

The requirement states that the sum of the fractions must equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). The algorithm dos not verify if the sum of the generated fractions \( \sum \frac{1}{b_i} \) actually equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It only relies on the existence of divisors.

### Example Testing

Letâ€™s consider the integer \( n = 4 \):

- The divisors of \( 4 \) in the required range are \( 2 \) only. 
- The fraction generated would be \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- The sum is \( \frac{1}{2} \), but \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). Therefore, the condition is not satisfied.

In this case, the program would incorrectly return:

```
YES
1
1 2
```

Yet the condition on the sum is unfulfilled since \( \frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{3}{4} \).

### Conclusion

Given the identified flaw where the program fails to ensure the sum of fractions calculates correctly to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \), the correctness of the program is compromised based on the problem description. 

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
