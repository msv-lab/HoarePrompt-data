You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's examine the logic step by step.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads a positive integer `n` from input.

2. **Initial Condition**:
    - If `n <= 2`, the program immediately returns 'NO'. (This is correct, since for `n = 2`, there are no valid divisors in the range required).

3. **Divisor Calculation**:
    - The program identifies divisors of `n` in the range (2, n) using trial division up to `sqrt(n)`.
    - It collects these divisors in a list called `divisors`.

4. **Checking Divisor List**:
    - If no divisors are found, it returns 'NO'.
    - If there are divisors, it proceeds to generate fractions of the form \( \frac{1}{b_i} \) for each divisor \( b_i \).

5. **Fraction Construction**:
    - The number of fractions \( k \) is determined by the length of the list of divisors.
    - The resulting output format specifies 'YES', followed by \( k \) and the actual fractions.

### Issue Identification

The output of the program is 'YES' only when there are divisors, which are collected and transformed into corresponding fractions. However, there's a flaw in the logic:

The requirement states that the sum of the fractions must equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). The algorithm dos not verify if the sum of the generated fractions \( \sum \frac{1}{b_i} \) actually equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). It only relies on the existence of divisors.

### Example Testing

Let’s consider the integer \( n = 4 \):

- The divisors of \( 4 \) in the required range are \( 2 \) only. 
- The fraction generated would be \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- The sum is \( \frac{1}{2} \), but \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). Therefore, the condition is not satisfied.

In this case, the program would incorrectly return:

```
YES
1
1 2
```

Yet the condition on the sum is unfulfilled since \( \frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{3}{4} \).

### Conclusion

Given the identified flaw where the program fails to ensure the sum of fractions calculates correctly to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \), the correctness of the program is compromised based on the problem description. 

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' because the current value of n is less than or equal to 2, and n is a positive integer within the specified range.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is greater than 2.
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. If `n` is prime, `divisors` will be empty.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' indicating that n is a prime number, as the current value of divisors is empty, meaning there are no divisors of n excluding n itself.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` (excluding `n` itself), `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is greater than 2. Additionally, `divisors` is not empty, indicating that `n` is not prime.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns 'YES' followed by the number of divisors `k`, where `k` is the number of elements in the list `divisors`, and then a list of fractions as tuples (1, d) for each divisor d in `divisors`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9). It returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or if `n` is a prime number (indicated by no divisors being found excluding `n` itself). If `n` has divisors, the function returns 'YES', followed by the count of those divisors `k`, and a list of fractions represented as tuples `(1, d)` for each divisor `d`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is exactly 2 or 3 (both return 'NO') and efficiently evaluates divisibility for larger values of `n` up to the specified upper bound.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
