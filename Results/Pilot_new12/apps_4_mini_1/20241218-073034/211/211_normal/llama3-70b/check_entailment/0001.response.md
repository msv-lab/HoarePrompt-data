Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for certain cases. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2
1 -1
```

In this case, the entire array sums to `0`. The program would output "NO" as expected, but when the input is changed to:
```
3
1 1 -2
```

The sum of the elements is `0`, but we can split the array into two parts:
- 1 1 (sum = 2)
- -2 (sum = -2)

However, the program will also output "NO" incorrectly because it checks only if the total sum is `0`.

Additionally, the way the parts are split is flawed as it doesn't always guarantee that at least one valid grouping is provided. For instance, with a valid input like:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The output is still "YES" but simply prints the entire array as a single part, which is not an issue, but rather the first problematic case illustrates that it fails to consider valid outputs when the total sums to non-zero but each individual part can still be structured to fulfill the requirement of non-zero subarrays.

In conclusion, the original logic cannot account for all potential inputs based on the constraints defined in the problem, leading to a case analysis where the program fails to return a correct output.
