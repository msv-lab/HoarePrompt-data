Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the splitting of the array as required by the problem description. Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Output for Non-Zero Total Sums**: The program currently checks if the total sum (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero in order to decide whether to print "NO". However, just because the total sum is not zero does not mean it is possible to actually split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. The problem statement specifies that each of the new arrays must have a non-zero sum. The code does not ensure that every subarray formed has a non-zero sum, and instead assumes that printing the valid indices as `k, l, n` will suffice. 

2. **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The current code only adds to the output if `prefix_sum[r]` is neither zero nor equal to the total sum. Consequently, it may produce output segments which could include zero-sum segments that aren't accounted for. The correct approach would require checking each possible subarray formed during the iteration to ensure they all result in non-zero sums.

3. **Printing of Indices**: The output specification from the problem description requires the indices of the subarrays to be printed in a certain way, specifically focused on the valid partitions where subarrays have sums that are non-zero. The current implementation does not guarantee that these conditions are fully satisfied, particularly when handling multiple valid partitions.

4. **Failure in Edge Cases**: For cases where the sum of all elements or any partition results in zero (e.g. certain arrangements of negative and positive integers), the program fails to return the correct response, which must check and confirm the conditions stated in the problem description strictly.

In summary, while the program correctly computes the prefix sums and checks if the total sum is zero, it fails to properly identify and produce valid non-zero subarrays based on those sums, violating the problem's requirements.
