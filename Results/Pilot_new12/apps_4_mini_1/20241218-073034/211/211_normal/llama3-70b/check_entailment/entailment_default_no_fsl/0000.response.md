Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly as outlined in the problem description. 

One specific issue is how it attempts to calculate subarrays based on non-zero prefix sums. The output logic for the subarrays does not correctly account for scenarios where valid segments could be created, especially in cases where the array has more complex distributions of negative and positive sums. The program only prints subarrays if the prefix sum does not equal zero and does not equal the total sum, which may lead to missing valid combinations.

For example, consider the input `4` followed by the array `1 -1 1 -1`. The total sum is `0`, which would produce the output "NO". However, the subarrays `1` and `2` can be valid since they have non-zero sums. The failure to recognize such valid configurations demonstrates that the logic employed to subdivide the array is inadequate.

Thus, there exist cases where the program fails to produce the correct output according to the rules established in the problem description. Hence the correctness is classified as false.
