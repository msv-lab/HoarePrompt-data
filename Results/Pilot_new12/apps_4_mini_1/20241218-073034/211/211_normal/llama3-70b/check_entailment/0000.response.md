To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s analyze it carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to split an array into several contiguous subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is not zero.
- If it is impossible to split the array accordingly, the output should be "NO".
- If it is possible to split, the output should include “YES”, followed by the number of subarrays and their respective starting and ending indices.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n`, the number of elements, and then reads the array `a`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix sum, which will help evaluate the sums of subarrays.

3. **Logic to Determine Output:**
   - If the overall sum (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, it prints "NO".
   - If not, it prints "YES" and initializes the subarray criteria.
   - The for loop iterates over the prefix sums to determine valid subarray ranges:
     - It checks if the current prefix sum is non-zero and not equal to the total sum; if valid, it prints the subarray range and updates the starting point.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the array consists of a single element which is zero (e.g., `1` input `0`), this correctly returns "NO".
2. For arrays that might have all non-zero sums culminating in a zero total but can be broken down properly (e.g., `[1, 2, -3]`), it returns "YES" and appropriate ranges.

### Potential Issue:
Upon analyzing the logic inside the for loop:
- Specifically when printing subarray ranges, the condition only accounts for segments where the prefix sum does not return to zero before the last element. However, it does not account for the case where multiple segments can lead to an overall non-zero balance while also including a zero subarray.
  
#### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 -3 0 0
```

- Total sum = `1 + 2 - 3 + 0 + 0 = 0` → Should return "NO", but if subarrays are checked individual parts, error could lie in additional zeros being seen as a segment but later this is ignored.

### Conclusion:
This logic appears solid, but due to its lack of consideration for cases we can find a case where it may fail to consider the zero subarray. Thus, let’s conclude that there are potential cases where the code does not correctly output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
