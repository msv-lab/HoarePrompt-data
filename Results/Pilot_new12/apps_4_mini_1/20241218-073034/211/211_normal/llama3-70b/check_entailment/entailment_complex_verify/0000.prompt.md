You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s analyze it carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to split an array into several contiguous subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is not zero.
- If it is impossible to split the array accordingly, the output should be "NO".
- If it is possible to split, the output should include “YES”, followed by the number of subarrays and their respective starting and ending indices.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n`, the number of elements, and then reads the array `a`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix sum, which will help evaluate the sums of subarrays.

3. **Logic to Determine Output:**
   - If the overall sum (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, it prints "NO".
   - If not, it prints "YES" and initializes the subarray criteria.
   - The for loop iterates over the prefix sums to determine valid subarray ranges:
     - It checks if the current prefix sum is non-zero and not equal to the total sum; if valid, it prints the subarray range and updates the starting point.

### Edge Cases:
1. If the array consists of a single element which is zero (e.g., `1` input `0`), this correctly returns "NO".
2. For arrays that might have all non-zero sums culminating in a zero total but can be broken down properly (e.g., `[1, 2, -3]`), it returns "YES" and appropriate ranges.

### Potential Issue:
Upon analyzing the logic inside the for loop:
- Specifically when printing subarray ranges, the condition only accounts for segments where the prefix sum does not return to zero before the last element. However, it does not account for the case where multiple segments can lead to an overall non-zero balance while also including a zero subarray.
  
#### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 -3 0 0
```

- Total sum = `1 + 2 - 3 + 0 + 0 = 0` → Should return "NO", but if subarrays are checked individual parts, error could lie in additional zeros being seen as a segment but later this is ignored.

### Conclusion:
This logic appears solid, but due to its lack of consideration for cases we can find a case where it may fail to consider the zero subarray. Thus, let’s conclude that there are potential cases where the code does not correctly output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a single integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, and `prefix_sum[0]` is 0.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `k` is equal to the number of valid indices `r` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `l` is equal to the last index `r` that satisfied the condition. If no such `r` exists, `k` remains 1 and `l` remains 1.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000 with `prefix_sum[0]` equal to 0. If `prefix_sum[n]` equals 0, then 'NO' is printed indicating that the sum of all elements in the list `a` is 0. Otherwise, `k` represents the number of valid indices `r` where `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `l` is the last index `r` that satisfies this condition, with the output `print(k, l, n)` produced.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers as input. It calculates the prefix sums of the list, determining the cumulative sums of the elements up to each index. If the total sum (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, it prints 'NO'. If the total sum is not zero, it prints 'YES' and counts the number of valid indices `r` where the prefix sum at `r` is neither zero nor equal to the total sum. For each valid index found, it prints the count of valid indices (`k`), the last valid index (`l`), and the value `n`. Finally, it also prints `k, l, n` which represent the count of valid indices, the last position that met the condition, and the total number of elements, respectively. If there are no valid indices, `k` remains 1 and `l` remains 1, indicating that the algorithm has a predetermined output in such cases. This function effectively assesses the sum characteristics of the input list and provides significant insights into its structure.
