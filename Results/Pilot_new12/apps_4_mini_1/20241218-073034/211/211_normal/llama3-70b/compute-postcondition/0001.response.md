The variable `a` is assigned a list generated by mapping the `int` function over the input received as a space-separated string. The input is expected to produce `n` integers, each of which must satisfy `-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3`. The variable `n` remains unchanged but determines the expected length of the list `a`. 

Given that `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, after executing the code, the value of `a` will be a list of `n` integers, all of which are expected to fall within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3.**
