To analyze the given code, let's break it down step by step.

1. The initial state mentions that `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. This means `n` can take any integer value within that range.
2. `a` is a list of `n` integers, each of which can be between -1000 and 1000. This means the content of the list can vary, and `a[i]` will refer to the ith element of the list.
3. `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0. Initially, each entry in `prefix_sum` is `0`. Thus, `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, and `prefix_sum[i]` for all `0 ≤ i ≤ n` is also `0`.
4. `i` starts as `0`.

Now, the code executed is:
```
prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
```

Given that `i` is `0` before the execution of the code, the left-hand side will refer to `prefix_sum[1]`, and the right-hand side will refer to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.

Calculating this step-by-step:
- The value of `prefix_sum[0]` is `0` (as initialized).
- `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`, which is an integer between -1000 and 1000 (let's refer to its value simply as `a[0]` for now).
- Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` will be updated to `0 + a[0]`, which equals `a[0]`.

The other variables maintain their values as follows:
- `n` remains an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000.
- `prefix_sum[0]` remains `0` as it was, and `prefix_sum[1]` is now `a[0]`.
- The variable `i` will still be `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers that satisfy -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 0.**
