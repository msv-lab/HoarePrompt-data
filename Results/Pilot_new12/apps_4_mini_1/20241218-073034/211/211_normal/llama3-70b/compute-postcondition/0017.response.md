Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `a` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1. The current value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and is also not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.***
