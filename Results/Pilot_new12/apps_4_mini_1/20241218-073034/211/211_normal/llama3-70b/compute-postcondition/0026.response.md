Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is updated to 3, `l` is set to 2, `r` is set to 2, and the values printed are 2, 1, 2. Otherwise, the else part does not exist, so no additional actions occur.***
