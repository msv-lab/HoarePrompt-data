According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and its range. The loop is controlled by `r`, which is iterated from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be increased by 1. Thus, `r` will become 3. Furthermore, since `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 100, if `r` is to be valid for the next iteration, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `k` is updated to 3, `l` is set to 2, `r` is 3; values printed are 2, 1, 2.**
