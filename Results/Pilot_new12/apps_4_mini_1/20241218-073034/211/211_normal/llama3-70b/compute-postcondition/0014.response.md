The variable `k` is assigned a value of `1`. There are no affected variables from the code snippet provided, and the previous conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state while updating `k` accordingly.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed, `k` is 1.**
