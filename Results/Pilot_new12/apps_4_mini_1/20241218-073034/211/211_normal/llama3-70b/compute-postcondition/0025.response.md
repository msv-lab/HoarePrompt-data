The value of `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State becomes: `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is 3, `l` is now 2, `r` is 2, and the values printed are 2, 1, 2.
