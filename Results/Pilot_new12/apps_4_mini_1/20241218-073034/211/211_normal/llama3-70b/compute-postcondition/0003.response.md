According to the code, the loop execution will depend on the value of `n`, which is guaranteed to be in the range from 1 to 100. This means that the loop will execute for `i` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of length `n`, and `prefix_sum` is initialized to zeros. The index `i` in the loop will begin at 0 for the first iteration.

To summarize the requirements for the loop to execute correctly:

1. The variable `n` must be 1 or greater (which it is, based on the initial state provided).
2. The variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state before the execution of the loop can be outlined as follows:

State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers that satisfy -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0, `i` is 0**
