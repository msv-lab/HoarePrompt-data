Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000 with `prefix_sum[0]` equal to 0. If `prefix_sum[n]` equals 0, then 'NO' is printed indicating that the sum of all elements in the list `a` is 0. Otherwise, `k` represents the number of valid indices `r` where `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `l` is the last index `r` that satisfies this condition, with the output `print(k, l, n)` produced.***
