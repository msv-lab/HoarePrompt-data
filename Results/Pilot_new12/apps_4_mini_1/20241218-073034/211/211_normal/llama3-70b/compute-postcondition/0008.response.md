`prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. Initially, `i` is 2, so `prefix_sum[3]` is being calculated as `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`. The value of `prefix_sum[2]` is known to be equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `a[2]` is a specific element from the list `a`. Thus, `prefix_sum[3]` can be expressed as `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers that satisfy -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, `prefix_sum[3]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2**
