The loop calculates the prefix sum of the list `a`, which contains `n` integers. After completing all iterations, the state of the `prefix_sum` list will be such that `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, where `prefix_sum[0]` remains 0. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute, and for each index `i`, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will equal the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to index `i`.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, and `prefix_sum[0]` is 0.**
