Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is updated to 4, `l` is set to 3, and `r` remains 3; values printed are 3, 2, 3.***
