According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be incremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, `i` becomes 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers that satisfy -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 1.**
