Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `k` is equal to the number of valid indices `r` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `l` is equal to the last index `r` that satisfied the condition. If no such `r` exists, `k` remains 1 and `l` remains 1.**
