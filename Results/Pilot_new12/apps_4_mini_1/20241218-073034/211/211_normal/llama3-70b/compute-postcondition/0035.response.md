The function `func` accepts a parameter `n` which is a single integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. It also accepts a parameter `A`, which is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3. The function processes these parameters and outputs a result based on their values. However, the specific output behavior has not been defined in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is described as follows.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` in the range 1 to 100, and a list `A` of `n` integers, each between -1000 and 1000.**
