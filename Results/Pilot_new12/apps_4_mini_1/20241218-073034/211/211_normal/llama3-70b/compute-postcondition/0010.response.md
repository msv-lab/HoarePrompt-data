Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`. `n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, and `prefix_sum[0]` is 0. The current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0, indicating that the sum of all elements in the list `a` is 0.***
