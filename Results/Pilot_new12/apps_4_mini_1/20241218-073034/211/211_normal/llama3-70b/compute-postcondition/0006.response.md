The line of code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the `prefix_sum` list by calculating the next prefix sum based on the current value of `i`. 

Here are the changes:
- `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will be assigned the value `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.
- Given the initial state, `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to `prefix_sum[1]`, which is `a[0]`, and `a[i]` is the integer at index `i`.

Since `i` is 1, we can deduce:
- `prefix_sum[2]` will now become `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]`
- Which is `a[0] + a[1]`.

Thus, the output state will feature the updated value of `prefix_sum[2]` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers that satisfy -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is equal to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `i` is 1.**
