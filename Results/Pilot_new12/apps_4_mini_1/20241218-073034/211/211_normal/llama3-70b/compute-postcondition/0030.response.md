The variable `l` is assigned the value of `r`. The previous value of `r` is 3, so `l` is now equal to 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 4; `l` is 3; `r` is 3; values printed are 3, 2, 3.**
