The variable `l` is assigned the value `1`. This does not affect any other variables like `prefix_sum`, `n`, `a`, or `k`. Thus, the output state simply reflects the updated value of `l`.

Output State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed, `k` is 1, `l` is 1.**
