Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is updated to 2 while `l` remains 1 and `r` remains 1. The initial conditions of the variables are preserved throughout the execution.***
