The line of code initializes `prefix_sum` as a list containing `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The variable `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, which determines the length of the `prefix_sum` list. This means after execution, `prefix_sum` will contain `n + 1` zeros. The state of the variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^3 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^3; `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.**
