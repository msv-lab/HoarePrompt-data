According to the code, the loop executes based on the integer `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). In this case, since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (as per the constraints given), the loop is set to execute at least once. 

At the start of each iteration of the loop, the values of `r` are determined by the range provided in the loop statement. Therefore, at the start of the loop:

- `r` will be initialized to 1 on the first iteration.
- The state of `prefix_sum` does not affect the ability to enter the loop, but it must maintain the condition that the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not zero.

Given these considerations, the states need to be captured as follows:

State: **`prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[i]` is equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying -1000 ≤ `a_i ≤ 1000, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `a` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1**
