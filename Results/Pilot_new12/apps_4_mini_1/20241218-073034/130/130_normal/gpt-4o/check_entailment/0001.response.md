To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the code along with the problem description and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Requirements Recap:

1. Ivan has \( K \) of \( N \) different collectible coins.
2. \( M \) friends are gifting coins.
3. Each friend must gift the same amount of coins.
4. All coins gifted must be different.
5. At least \( L \) new coins (coins not in Ivan's collection) must be included in the gifts.

### Key Observations:

1. The maximum number of different coins that can be gifted is \( N - K \) since \( K \) are already in Ivan's collection.
2. If \( M \) friends are each giving \( x \) coins, then \( M \times x \) must be less than or equal to \( N \) to ensure all gifted coins are different.
3. Additionally, \( M \times x \geq L \) must hold true to ensure that at least \( L \) coins are new in Ivan's collection.

### Analyzing the Code:

The given code computes the minimum number of coins \( x \) that each friend must give.

1. Calculate \( min_x \) as \( (L + M - 1) // M \). This ensures that the total gifted coins accommodate at least \( L \) new coins.
2. The next condition checks if \( M \times min_x \) does not exceed the total number of available new coins, which is \( N - K \).

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Case where \( N - K < L \)**: If the number of new coins available is less than \( L \), gifting at least \( L \) new coins is impossible, and the output should be `-1`. The current code does not explicitly check this condition before trying to compute \( min_x \).

2. **Zero Gifts Needed**: If \( M = 0 \), then there shouldn't be a need for any gifts; however, the problem doesn't specify how to handle such a case.

### Example Testing:

1. **Example 1**: For input `20 15 2 3`, valid output should be `1` since it allows for 15 different coins, out of which 13 are guaranteed to be new.
2. **Example 2**: For input `10 11 2 4`, output `-1` is correct because there are not enough different coins.

### Conclusion:

The check for \( N - K < L \) is missing in the program. Following the test cases and potential conditions:

- If we enter a situation where \( L \) exceeds available new coins, the current code logic will produce erroneous results.
  
Thus, I can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where it's impossible to give at least \( L \) new coins correctly. For instance, with inputs \( 5, 2, 2, 4 \) (where N=5, M=2, K=2, L=4), the program would incorrectly attempt to calculate \( min_x \) without recognizing that there are not enough new coins to gift.
