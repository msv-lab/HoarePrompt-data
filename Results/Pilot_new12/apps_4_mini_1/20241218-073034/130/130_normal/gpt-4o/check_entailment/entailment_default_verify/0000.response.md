Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must give to satisfy Ivan's gifting conditions, ensuring that the total number of distinct coins Ivan receives meets all specified constraints.

The reasoning outlined in the original assessment properly explains how the code handles the requirements of the problem, including the logic behind calculating `min_x` and the necessary checks to determine if fulfilling the conditions is possible. Furthermore, the program accounts for edge cases that could arise (e.g., when `M * min_x` exceeds the available distinct coins after accounting for Ivan's current collection).

The output hints also corroborate the functionality of the program, indicating that it is designed to handle the given constraints and to print the correct output based on the input conditionsâ€”either the calculated minimum or `-1` if the conditions cannot be met.

Overall, the program and the assessment provide a coherent and accurate representation of the solution to the problem. Thus, the final correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
