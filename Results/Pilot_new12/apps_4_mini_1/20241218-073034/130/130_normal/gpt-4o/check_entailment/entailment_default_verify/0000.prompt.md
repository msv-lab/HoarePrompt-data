You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Ivan has `K` coins.
2. There are `N` different collectible coins available.
3. `M` friends are gifting coins, each must gift the same number of coins.
4. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.
5. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins each friend can gift or determine if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, and calculates `min_x`, which represents the minimum number of coins each friend should give to meet the requirements. The key calculations are:
1. `min_x` is determined by the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift such that together at least `L` new coins are presented.
2. The condition checks if `M * min_x` (total coins given by all friends) is less than or equal to `N - K` (the number of new coins that could be standing out from the total coins).

### Checking for Edge Cases:
Let's break down the logic and edge cases:

1. **Sufficient Total Coins:** 
   - If `M * min_x` exceeds `N - K`, it's impossible to present the required number of unique coins.
   - This will catch cases where there are not enough unique coins available, given the current collection.

2. **Minimum Case:** 
   - If Ivan has `M` friends and they all need to give at least one coin, but `N` is less than `M`, it will certainly fail the unique coins condition.

3. **Testing Edge Cases:** 
   - Examples when `N = K`, `M > N`, and `L > M` to see if they are handled correctly:
     - Input: `N = 5, M = 10, K = 5, L = 10`
       - This should return `-1` because there aren’t enough different coins for each friend to gift.
     - Input: `N = 5, M = 2, K = 0, L = 6`
       - This should return `-1` as it's impossible to give 6 new coins with only 5 available.

### Conclusion:
Since the formula used and the conditions should work for all valid inputs, we look for any instances where it breaks. 
However, through analysis, we find that the edge cases are already considered, and the program does output `-1` when conditions aren't met.

As I cannot immediately find a case where this logic fails, I determine the following:

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The function correctly computes the minimum coins needed to meet the friend’s gift requirements while ensuring at least `L` new coins are included in Ivan's collection. It efficiently handles cases where it's impossible to fulfill the requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers, N, M, K, and L, from standard input, ensuring that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. It calculates the minimum number of complete units, `min_x`, that can be obtained from L using a rate of M (specifically, `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`), which is the ceiling of L / M. The function then checks if M multiplied by `min_x` can be accommodated within the remaining value of N minus K. If it can, it prints `min_x`. If it cannot, it prints -1. Thus, the final program state includes integers N, K, M, and L remaining unchanged, while the output will be either the computed `min_x` or -1 based on the comparison. The function does not return any values, but rather prints its result directly. It should be noted that no error handling exists for the input, so if the input values do not conform to the specified constraints, the function will still attempt to compute and print a result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
