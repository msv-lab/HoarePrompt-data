To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and ensure it adheres to the conditions specified in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `N`: Total number of different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Number of coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
   - All gifted coins must be different.
   - At least `L` coins in total must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Key Observations:
1. Each friend needs to give at least `min_x` coins, where `min_x` must satisfy:
   - `min_x * M` coins should be distinct and should not exceed the total number of distinct coins available (`N`).
   - From the equation derived in the program, we have `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`. This calculates the minimal number of coins each friend must give to ensure that collectively they give at least `L` new coins.
   
2. The program checks if the total number of distinct coins given by friends (i.e., `M * min_x`) would be less than or equal to the total number of available new coins (`N - K`), indicating that the number of new coins can still fit within the available collection.

3. If `M * min_x <= N - K`, the program outputs `min_x`; otherwise, it outputs `-1`, indicating that the gifting conditions cannot be met.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case Analysis**:
  - If `M` is greater than `N`, it is immediately impossible to satisfy the condition since each friend can't gift a different coin.
  - If `K + L > N`, it is not possible since Ivan can't receive more than `N` coins in total including the new gifts.
  - The computation of `min_x` and its comparison against the gifts collectively ensures that Ivan will receive the required number of new coins.

- The program comprehensively covers all these outlined requirements in steps as derived from the problem conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic to compute the minimal number of coins each friend can give while adhering to all conditions in the problem description. 

Thus, the output for this verification is:

Correctness: **True**
