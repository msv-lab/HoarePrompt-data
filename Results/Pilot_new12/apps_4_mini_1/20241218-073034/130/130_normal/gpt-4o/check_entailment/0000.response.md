To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Ivan has `K` coins.
2. There are `N` different collectible coins available.
3. `M` friends are gifting coins, each must gift the same number of coins.
4. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.
5. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins each friend can gift or determine if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, and calculates `min_x`, which represents the minimum number of coins each friend should give to meet the requirements. The key calculations are:
1. `min_x` is determined by the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`. This calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift such that together at least `L` new coins are presented.
2. The condition checks if `M * min_x` (total coins given by all friends) is less than or equal to `N - K` (the number of new coins that could be standing out from the total coins).

### Checking for Edge Cases:
Let's break down the logic and edge cases:

1. **Sufficient Total Coins:** 
   - If `M * min_x` exceeds `N - K`, it's impossible to present the required number of unique coins.
   - This will catch cases where there are not enough unique coins available, given the current collection.

2. **Minimum Case:** 
   - If Ivan has `M` friends and they all need to give at least one coin, but `N` is less than `M`, it will certainly fail the unique coins condition.

3. **Testing Edge Cases:** 
   - Examples when `N = K`, `M > N`, and `L > M` to see if they are handled correctly:
     - Input: `N = 5, M = 10, K = 5, L = 10`
       - This should return `-1` because there aren’t enough different coins for each friend to gift.
     - Input: `N = 5, M = 2, K = 0, L = 6`
       - This should return `-1` as it's impossible to give 6 new coins with only 5 available.

### Conclusion:
Since the formula used and the conditions should work for all valid inputs, we look for any instances where it breaks. 
However, through analysis, we find that the edge cases are already considered, and the program does output `-1` when conditions aren't met.

As I cannot immediately find a case where this logic fails, I determine the following:

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The function correctly computes the minimum coins needed to meet the friend’s gift requirements while ensuring at least `L` new coins are included in Ivan's collection. It efficiently handles cases where it's impossible to fulfill the requirements.
