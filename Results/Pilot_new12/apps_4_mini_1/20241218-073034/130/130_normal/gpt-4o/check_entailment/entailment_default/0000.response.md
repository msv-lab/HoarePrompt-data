The program reads four integers \( N \), \( M \), \( K \), and \( L \) and calculates the minimum number of different coins that each of Ivan's friends can gift him. The problem description states that it must ensure all friends gift the same number of coins, and at least \( L \) of those must be new to Ivan's collection.

1. The line `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` calculates the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift in order to ensure that at least \( L \) are new, which is correct due to the ceiling function behavior of the division.

2. The following condition `if M * min_x <= N - K:` checks whether the total coins gifted (that are new) can fit within the total number of distinct coins available after considering what Ivan already has. If this check fails, it implies that fulfilling the gift requirement is impossible, and thus outputs `-1`.

However, there is a critical limitation:

- The scenario where \( M \) (the number of friends) is greater than \( N - K \) (the maximum number of new coins available): 
   - For instance, consider \( N = 10 \), \( K = 9 \), \( M = 2 \), and \( L = 1 \). Here, the remaining coins available are \( 1 \), which means both friends cannot gift each other different coins, and they could only gift the same coin. In such a case, the program does not correctly handle the impossibility condition and may produce flawed logic.

- Another edge case can be identified, for example, with \( N = 5 \), \( K = 1 \), \( M = 4 \), and \( L = 3 \). Here, even though the friends want to satisfy the requirements, the remaining coins will not suffice which the program will not catch.

Taking the above edge cases into account:

Correctness: **False**.
