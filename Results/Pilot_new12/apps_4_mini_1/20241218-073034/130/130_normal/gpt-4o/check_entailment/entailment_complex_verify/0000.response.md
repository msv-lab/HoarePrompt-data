The original assessment provided a thorough analysis of the problem description in relation to the program's logic. The function correctly calculates the minimum coins each friend needs to gift based on provided inputs. Specifically, it accounts for both the necessity of unique coin gifts as well as the requirement for a specified number of new coins in Ivan's collection. Importantly, it outputs `-1` when it determines that the gifting conditions cannot be met.

Examining the annotated code confirms that the state of the variables and their relationships are maintained throughout execution without contravening the boundaries set by the problem description. The program adheres to the constraints and conditions as specified.

Given that all crucial elements of the problem have been addressed effectively by the program, I believe the original assessment's conclusion regarding the correctness of the program holds. 

Thus, my refined assessment is:
Final: **True**
