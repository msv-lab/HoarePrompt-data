You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the code along with the problem description and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Requirements Recap:

1. Ivan has \( K \) of \( N \) different collectible coins.
2. \( M \) friends are gifting coins.
3. Each friend must gift the same amount of coins.
4. All coins gifted must be different.
5. At least \( L \) new coins (coins not in Ivan's collection) must be included in the gifts.

### Key Observations:

1. The maximum number of different coins that can be gifted is \( N - K \) since \( K \) are already in Ivan's collection.
2. If \( M \) friends are each giving \( x \) coins, then \( M \times x \) must be less than or equal to \( N \) to ensure all gifted coins are different.
3. Additionally, \( M \times x \geq L \) must hold true to ensure that at least \( L \) coins are new in Ivan's collection.

### Analyzing the Code:

The given code computes the minimum number of coins \( x \) that each friend must give.

1. Calculate \( min_x \) as \( (L + M - 1) // M \). This ensures that the total gifted coins accommodate at least \( L \) new coins.
2. The next condition checks if \( M \times min_x \) does not exceed the total number of available new coins, which is \( N - K \).

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Case where \( N - K < L \)**: If the number of new coins available is less than \( L \), gifting at least \( L \) new coins is impossible, and the output should be `-1`. The current code does not explicitly check this condition before trying to compute \( min_x \).

2. **Zero Gifts Needed**: If \( M = 0 \), then there shouldn't be a need for any gifts; however, the problem doesn't specify how to handle such a case.

### Example Testing:

1. **Example 1**: For input `20 15 2 3`, valid output should be `1` since it allows for 15 different coins, out of which 13 are guaranteed to be new.
2. **Example 2**: For input `10 11 2 4`, output `-1` is correct because there are not enough different coins.

### Conclusion:

The check for \( N - K < L \) is missing in the program. Following the test cases and potential conditions:

- If we enter a situation where \( L \) exceeds available new coins, the current code logic will produce erroneous results.
  
Thus, I can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where it's impossible to give at least \( L \) new coins correctly. For instance, with inputs \( 5, 2, 2, 4 \) (where N=5, M=2, K=2, L=4), the program would incorrectly attempt to calculate \( min_x \) without recognizing that there are not enough new coins to gift.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers, N, M, K, and L, from standard input, ensuring that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. It calculates the minimum number of complete units, `min_x`, that can be obtained from L using a rate of M (specifically, `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`), which is the ceiling of L / M. The function then checks if M multiplied by `min_x` can be accommodated within the remaining value of N minus K. If it can, it prints `min_x`. If it cannot, it prints -1. Thus, the final program state includes integers N, K, M, and L remaining unchanged, while the output will be either the computed `min_x` or -1 based on the comparison. The function does not return any values, but rather prints its result directly. It should be noted that no error handling exists for the input, so if the input values do not conform to the specified constraints, the function will still attempt to compute and print a result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
