To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the requirements from the description and how the program handles them.

### Problem Description Requirements
1. Ivan has $N$ different collectible coins, and he already has $K$ of them.
2. $M$ friends want to gift coins, and each friend must give the same number of coins.
3. All the coins given must be different.
4. At least $L$ of these gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Required Outputs
- The program should output the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions, or print "-1" if it's impossible.

### Program Analysis
The function reads four integers `N`, `K`, `M`, and `L` and computes as follows:
1. It calculates `min_x`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift such that:
   \[
   min\_x = \lceil \frac{L}{M} \rceil
   \]
   This ensures that the total number of new coins (at least `L`) can be contributed by `M` friends.
   
2. Then it checks whether the total number of coins gifted (which is `M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of coins available to gift (`N - K`). This ensures that the total gifted coins do not exceed the number of different coins Ivan can receive given his current collection:
   ```python
   if (M * min_x <= N - K) :
   ```

3. If the condition is satisfied, it outputs `min_x`. If not, it outputs `-1`.

### Validity Check
- The calculation of `min_x` ensures that the number of new coins from gifts is met, as it rounds up the division to ensure at least `L` are new.
- The check `M * min_x <= N - K` ensures that there are enough different coins left after considering what Ivan already has.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem according to the requirements set forth in the description:
- It calculates the necessary minimum coins each friend must gift based on the requirement for new coins.
- It verifies if the gifted coins do not exceed the total different coins available after accounting for what Ivan already owns.

Thus, the program will always provide the correct output as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
