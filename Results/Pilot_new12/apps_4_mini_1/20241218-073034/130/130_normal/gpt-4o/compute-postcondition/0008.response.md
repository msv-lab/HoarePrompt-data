The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that N, M, K, and L are integers, with the following conditions: 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. The function processes these integers and returns a value based on them. However, since there are no specified outputs or logic tied to the provided output, we cannot detail specific return values. Therefore, without additional information on what the function actually returns or how it processes its input, we can only conclude that it respects the constraints outlined. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but adheres to the constraints that N, M, K, and L are integers where 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. The return value specifics are not provided.**
