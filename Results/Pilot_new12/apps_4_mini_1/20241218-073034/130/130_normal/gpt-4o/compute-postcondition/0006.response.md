The code snippet executes a print statement which prints `-1`. No variables have their values changed or updated as a result of this statement. Thus, the values of `N`, `K`, `M`, `L`, and `min_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `K`, `M`, and `L` are assigned integer values where `M` is in the range of 1 to 10^18, `L` is in the range of 1 to 10^18, `min_x` is assigned the value of `(L + M - 1) // M`, and `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`. The output printed is -1.**
