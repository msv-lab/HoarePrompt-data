The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are reassigned based on the `input` string that is read and then split into integers. The new values will depend on what is inputted, but they remain within the given bounds (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18). The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned new integer values from the input string, while maintaining the conditions 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18.**
