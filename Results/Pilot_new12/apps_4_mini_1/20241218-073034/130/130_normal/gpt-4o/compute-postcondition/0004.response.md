The `print(min_x)` statement outputs the value of `min_x`. The initial state provided includes the calculation of `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`. Since no variables are modified by this print operation, the state of `N`, `K`, `M`, `L`, and `min_x` remains valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer value, `K` is an integer value, `M` is an integer value (1 ≤ M ≤ 10^18), `L` is an integer value (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^18), `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`, and `min_x` has been printed.**
