Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect for multiple reasons based on the outlined conditions in the problem description:

1. **Conditions Check**: The program checks if both `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L` to print `1`, otherwise it prints `-1`. However, the condition `M >= N - K + 1` alone is insufficient to ensure that all friends can gift coins that are different and that at least `L` new coins are included. 

2. **Necessary Coin Calculation**: The number of new coins (`L`) that need to be gifted dictates that the total new coins received should be `M * coins_per_friend` where `coins_per_friend` is the number of coins each of Ivan's friends gifts. There are not enough different coins if `M * coins_per_friend > N`. Thus, the condition does not consider the minimum coins each friend must give to meet the new coin requirements, leading to cases where it can print `1` incorrectly when it should print `-1`.

3. **Example of Failure**: For the input `N = 10`, `M = 11`, `K = 2`, `L = 4`, there are only 10 different coins available, but Ivan has 11 friends. It is impossible for all friends to give different coins (because `M > N`). The program would output `-1`, which is correct. However, inputs like `N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, L = 13` would result in `1` from the program, which is incorrect as `15` coins gifted cannot guarantee that at least 13 are new (as there's no guarantee of existing coins).

In summary, the program does not verify all the necessary conditions for the number of coins each friend must give nor correctly handles cases where the conditions cannot be satisfied.
