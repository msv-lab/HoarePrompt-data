The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the requirements and the corresponding code to determine why it is incorrect.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Ivan has `K` different coins out of a total of `N`.
2. He has `M` friends who must give him the same number of coins.
3. All coins gifted must be different.
4. At least `L` of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Conditions derived from the problem:
1. Each friend can give `x` coins; thus, the total number of coins gifted by all friends is `M * x`.
2. The total number of different coins that can be received must be at least `L` new coins. This means:
   - The maximum number of different coins he can receive is `N`. Therefore, the total number of coins given must satisfy: 
     - `M * x â‰¤ N`
   - In addition to the above, since Ivan already has `K` coins, at least `L` should be new:
     - Thus, `M * x >= L`
   - Lastly, to ensure the coins gifted must be different from what Ivan owns, we need to ensure:
     - `M * x + K <= N` which rearranges to `M * x <= N - K`.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
The code checks:
```python
if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
```
- The first condition `M >= N - K + 1` does not correctly ensure that the total number of different coins gifted does not exceed the available coins after accounting for Ivan's collection.
- The second condition `M >= L` does not ensure that at least `L` coins can be new in any given valid distribution.

The code, hence, incorrectly outputs "`1`" when it shouldn't, and fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of coins per friend needed to satisfy both the new coins condition and the unique coins condition.

### Example Analysis:
For the test case:
1. Input: `20 15 2 3`
   - It should calculate that 15 friends need to gift coins, and we need to ensure that at least 3 of them are new. The only requirement here states that they need to gift a minimum of 1 coin each to satisfy all conditions, hence the output "1" is indeed correct for this example.

For the test case:
2. Input: `10 11 2 4`
   - There are only 10 overall coins possible but 11 friends. Even if each friend wants to gift coins, it's impossible to have all different ones. Thus, the correct output should be "`-1`". However, according to the code's logic, it might output "`-1`" as well, but does not correctly calculate or assess the minimum required coins to achieve the goals set forth.

Thus, the code fails to meet every potential case requirement, particularly by not adequately assessing the minimum coins per friend gift situation.

### Conclusion:
The code does not accurately follow the problem description across every potential test input.

Correctness: **False**
