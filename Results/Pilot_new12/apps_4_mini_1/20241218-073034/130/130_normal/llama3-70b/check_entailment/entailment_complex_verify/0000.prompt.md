You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s analyze the logic step-by-step and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Assessment
Ivan has:
- \( N \): Total different collectible coins
- \( M \): Number of friends
- \( K \): Number of coins Ivan already has
- \( L \): Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted

### Conditions to Consider:
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different.
3. At least \( L \) coins must be new (not in Ivan's collection).

### Program Logic
The program checks two conditions:
1. If \( M \) (the number of friends) is greater than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \). This checks if the friends can gift enough different coins to Ivan without repeating those he already has.
   
2. If \( M \) is also greater than or equal to \( L \), ensuring that the number of coins gifted is at least the minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

If both conditions are met, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift one coin. If not, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Cases to Check
Let’s consider some edge cases that may not be handled properly by the program:

1. **Case where \( K + L > N \)**: 
   - Example: \( N = 10, M = 5, K = 6, L = 5 \)
   - Explanation: Ivan already has 6 coins, and to satisfy the requirement of gifting 5 new coins, at least 11 different coins would be required (6 owned + 5 new). Thus, \( K + L > N \) would make it impossible to satisfy the conditions, but the program as described does not specifically check for this case.

2. **Case where \( L \) is greater than available coins minus those Ivan has**:
   - Example: \( N = 10, M = 5, K = 8, L = 3 \)
   - Explanation: Ivan already has 8 coins, which leaves only 2 new coins possible. Thus it is impossible for his 5 friends to gift at least 3 new coins. The program would fail to account for this, simply checking the two conditions mentioned.

3. **Case where if \( M > N \)**:
   - Example: \( N = 5, M = 6, K = 1, L = 1 \)
   - Explanation: With more friends gifting than the total coins available, it is impossible for them all to gift different coins. The program does check if \( M \) is less than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \), but may miss if \( M \) exceeds \( N \) outright.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for the situation where \( K + L > N \) or when the number of friends exceeds the total number of different coins available, which can lead to an incorrect output.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, M, K, and L are integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers assigned new values from input such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`, the function outputs 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not satisfied (implying that either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`), the function outputs -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from input, validates them within specified constraints (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18), and evaluates a condition based on the values of M, N, and K. If M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and also greater than or equal to L, the function outputs 1. If the condition is not satisfied, the function outputs -1. However, the function does not return any values or perform further actions beyond outputting the result as an integer, which indicates whether certain conditions on the input values are satisfied. Additionally, it should be noted that the function lacks error handling for invalid input forms, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-integer inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
