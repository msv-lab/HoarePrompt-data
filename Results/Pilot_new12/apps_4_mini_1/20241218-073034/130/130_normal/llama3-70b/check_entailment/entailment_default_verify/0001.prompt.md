You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the requirement that all coins gifted to Ivan must be different and that at least `L` coins must be new to his collection. 

One potential case where the logic of the program does not hold is when the total number of friends `M` exceeds the number of unique coins `N`. If `M` > `N`, then it's impossible for each friend to gift a different coin, and the output should be `-1`. 

However, the current program only checks if `M >= N - K + 1` (implying more friends than the remaining unique coins after considering Ivan's collection). It does not check if `M` is greater than `N` itself. 

For example, if we take inputs like:
```
Input: 5 7 2 3
```
We have:
- N = 5 (total different coins)
- M = 7 (friends)
- K = 2 (coins Ivan has)
- L = 3 (coins must be new)

In this case, since `M` (7) > `N` (5), it is impossible for the friends to give distinct coins to Ivan. The program would still output `1` because it would incorrectly suggest that it's possible for each friend to gift at least one coin, which contradicts the uniqueness requirement.

Thus, due to the incomplete checks, the program does not meet the problem conditions correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from input, validates them within specified constraints (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18), and evaluates a condition based on the values of M, N, and K. If M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and also greater than or equal to L, the function outputs 1. If the condition is not satisfied, the function outputs -1. However, the function does not return any values or perform further actions beyond outputting the result as an integer, which indicates whether certain conditions on the input values are satisfied. Additionally, it should be noted that the function lacks error handling for invalid input forms, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-integer inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
