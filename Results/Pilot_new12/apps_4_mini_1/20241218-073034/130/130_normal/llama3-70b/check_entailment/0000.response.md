To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s analyze the logic step-by-step and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Assessment
Ivan has:
- \( N \): Total different collectible coins
- \( M \): Number of friends
- \( K \): Number of coins Ivan already has
- \( L \): Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted

### Conditions to Consider:
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different.
3. At least \( L \) coins must be new (not in Ivan's collection).

### Program Logic
The program checks two conditions:
1. If \( M \) (the number of friends) is greater than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \). This checks if the friends can gift enough different coins to Ivan without repeating those he already has.
   
2. If \( M \) is also greater than or equal to \( L \), ensuring that the number of coins gifted is at least the minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

If both conditions are met, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend can gift one coin. If not, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Cases to Check
Let’s consider some edge cases that may not be handled properly by the program:

1. **Case where \( K + L > N \)**: 
   - Example: \( N = 10, M = 5, K = 6, L = 5 \)
   - Explanation: Ivan already has 6 coins, and to satisfy the requirement of gifting 5 new coins, at least 11 different coins would be required (6 owned + 5 new). Thus, \( K + L > N \) would make it impossible to satisfy the conditions, but the program as described does not specifically check for this case.

2. **Case where \( L \) is greater than available coins minus those Ivan has**:
   - Example: \( N = 10, M = 5, K = 8, L = 3 \)
   - Explanation: Ivan already has 8 coins, which leaves only 2 new coins possible. Thus it is impossible for his 5 friends to gift at least 3 new coins. The program would fail to account for this, simply checking the two conditions mentioned.

3. **Case where if \( M > N \)**:
   - Example: \( N = 5, M = 6, K = 1, L = 1 \)
   - Explanation: With more friends gifting than the total coins available, it is impossible for them all to gift different coins. The program does check if \( M \) is less than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \), but may miss if \( M \) exceeds \( N \) outright.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for the situation where \( K + L > N \) or when the number of friends exceeds the total number of different coins available, which can lead to an incorrect output.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
