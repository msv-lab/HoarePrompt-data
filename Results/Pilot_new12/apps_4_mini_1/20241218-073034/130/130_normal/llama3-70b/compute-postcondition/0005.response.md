Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers assigned new values from input such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`, the function outputs 1. Otherwise, if the condition is not satisfied (implying that either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`), the function outputs -1.***
