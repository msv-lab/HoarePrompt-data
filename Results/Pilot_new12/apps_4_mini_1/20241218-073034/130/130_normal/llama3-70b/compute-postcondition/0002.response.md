The code snippet `print(1)` simply outputs the value `1`, and it does not change any of the state variables `N`, `M`, `K`, or `L`. The values of those variables remain unchanged according to the conditions provided. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers assigned new values from input such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18. The current value of `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`. The value printed is 1.**
