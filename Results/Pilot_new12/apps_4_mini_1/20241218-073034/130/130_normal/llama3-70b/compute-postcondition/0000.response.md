The code snippet `N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())` assigns new integer values to the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. The new values of these variables come from user input with the constraint that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. 

Since all variables are integers, the initial conditions still hold true:

1. After execution, `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` will have new integer values as provided by the user input.
2. The constraints on the values, `1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18`, will still apply.

Therefore, the Output State can be expressed as:

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers assigned new values from input such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18**.
