The function `func` accepts four parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. All parameters are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. The function does not have any explicit output specified in the provided details. Therefore, based on the provided constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four integers, `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`, without a clear return value stated. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: integers N, M, K, and L under certain constraints.**
