You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a positive integer where 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each v[i] (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9) represents the volume of kvass in the i-th keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, representing the largest integer such that the sum of min(`low`, x) for each x in `v` is less than `s`. The loop will have terminated since `low` is no longer less than `high`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as the original user inputs. `total` is at least less than or equal to `s` at the last comparison, and the specific values of `total`, `low`, and `high` depend on all iterations made of the loop restrictions that were in effect during execution.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, representing the largest integer such that the sum of min(`low`, `x`) for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`; if the sum is not equal to `s`, the code prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of `low`, which is equal to `high`, while the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `total` is less than or equal to `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the total volume of kvass needed), along with a list `v` of `n` integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg. It determines the largest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each keg's volume in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If no such `low` exists where the sum equals `s`, the function outputs -1. If a valid `low` is found, the function outputs this value. The input values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. Edge cases include situations where the total volume in `v` is less than `s` and cases where the volumes in `v` do not allow for a perfect match to `s`, in which case -1 is printed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
