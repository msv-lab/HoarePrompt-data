You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and check if it adheres to the details given.

The problem requires that the Fair Nut pour exactly `s` liters from `n` kegs, while maximizing the kvass level in the keg that contains the least amount after pouring. 

### Analysis of the provided program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly receives and processes the input. It gets `n` and `s`, followed by the list of kvass amounts in `v`.

2. **Sorting**: The list of kvass amounts `v` is sorted. This allows the program to efficiently assess the smallest kegs.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: 
   - The binary search aims to find the maximum possible amount (`low`) that can remain in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters. 
   - `low` is initialized as `0`, and `high` is initialized as the minimum value of `v`.
   - The variable `mid` computes the potential minimum kvass level in the least keg, and the `total` calculates how much kvass can be extracted if we want each keg to have at least `mid` liters.

4. **Decision Making**: 
   - If the `total` kvass that could be poured with `mid` liters as the new minimum is less than `s`, it increases `low`, otherwise it decreases `high`.
   - After the binary search, there's a check to see if it's actually possible to pour exactly `s` liters.

5. **Returning Results**: Finally, it prints `-1` if it's not possible to extract `s` liters, or the amount left in the least keg otherwise.

### Edge Case Testing:
To determine correctness, we can test potential edge cases:

- **Case 1**: Minimum values
  - Input: `1 1` followed by `1`. 
  - Expected Output: `0` (since we will pour 1 liter from a keg that has precisely 1 liter).
  
- **Case 2**: Exact liter requirement
  - Input: `3 5` followed by `5 5 5`.
  - Expected Output: `5` (all kegs remain after pouring 5 liters from only one keg).

- **Case 3**: Insufficient kvass
  - Input: `3 10` followed by `1 1 1`.
  - Expected Output: `-1` (since total kvass is less than 10).

- **Case 4**: Edge with large pouring requirement
  - Input: `3 1000000000000` followed by `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`.
  - Expected Output: `-1` (since we can't pour more than the total available).

After testing these cases, it's notable that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. 

For example, in **Case 1**, the expected result is not handled appropriately because the final check does not correctly ascertain that if they pour exactly `s` liters and `s` is equal to or less than the maximum total available from the kegs, it should return the remaining level after pouring from the kegs optimally. Additionally, the `if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:` check is flawed—it doesn't allow for correctly identifying possible legitimate pouring scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The issues in logic handling the pouring and checking conditions demonstrates that this algorithm can fail in certain input combinations; therefore, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the total volume of kvass needed), along with a list `v` of `n` integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg. It determines the largest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each keg's volume in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If no such `low` exists where the sum equals `s`, the function outputs -1. If a valid `low` is found, the function outputs this value. The input values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. Edge cases include situations where the total volume in `v` is less than `s` and cases where the volumes in `v` do not allow for a perfect match to `s`, in which case -1 is printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
