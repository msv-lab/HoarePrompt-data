You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the requirements in the problem description.

### Program Breakdown

1. **Inputs**: The program reads two integers `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters desired to be poured), followed by a list of integers representing the volume in each keg.
   
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of kegs `v`. This helps to determine the ordering of keg volumes, which is essential for logic that depends on the minimum values.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The code attempts to find the maximum possible minimum volume (`low`) that can remain in the keg after pouring `s` liters.
   - The binary search adjusts `low` and `high` based on whether the total liters that can be poured (calculated using the minimum of `mid` and each keg volume) is sufficient.

4. **Final Check**: After the binary search loop, it checks if pouring exactly `s` liters is possible with the remaining minimum volume found. If the total liters that could be poured does not equal `s`, it returns `-1`.

### Identifying Edge Cases

To determine correctness:
- **Case when not enough kvass**: If the sum of all kegs is less than `s`, it should return `-1`. The program handles this correctly.
  
- **Case when exact s liters can be poured**: If exact pouring results in all kegs retaining a specific minimum value, the logic should ensure that this is indeed possible.

### Possible Failure Points
Consider the case where we can just barely pour `s` liters:

Let’s take the input:
```
1 1000000000000
1000000000
```
Here, we have `1` keg with `1,000,000,000` liters, and we want to pour `1,000,000,000,000` liters.

### Testing the Input
1. The program will sort the list: `v = [1000000000]`.
2. It can’t pour `1,000,000,000,000` liters as there’s only `1,000,000,000` available, so it should print `-1`.
3. However, during the binary search, `low` and `high` will not adjust correctly because it does not handle the case where the aggregated kvass is less than `s`.

### Conclusion
Therefore, in this specific example, the case where the total kvass is insufficient (`1e9 < 1e12`) should lead to a direct output of `-1`. Since the program does not check for the overall total sum directly before performing operations, it may enter incorrect logic branches that yield incorrect results.

Correctness: **False** 

This case demonstrates a scenario where the program could fail to yield the correct output based on the problem description requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes two integers, `n` (the number of kegs) and `s` (the total volume of kvass needed), along with a list `v` of `n` integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg. It determines the largest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each keg's volume in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If no such `low` exists where the sum equals `s`, the function outputs -1. If a valid `low` is found, the function outputs this value. The input values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. Edge cases include situations where the total volume in `v` is less than `s` and cases where the volumes in `v` do not allow for a perfect match to `s`, in which case -1 is printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
