The values of `n` and `s` are assigned from input where the `map(int, input().split())` function takes a single line of input containing two integers and converts them into integers. Therefore, the output state should reflect that `n` and `s` are no longer just constrained to their previous ranges; they now take the specific values entered by the user. The variable `v` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to user input, `s` is a positive integer equal to user input, and `v` is a list of n integers where each v[i] (1 <= v[i] <= 10^9) represents the volume of kvass in the i-th keg.**
