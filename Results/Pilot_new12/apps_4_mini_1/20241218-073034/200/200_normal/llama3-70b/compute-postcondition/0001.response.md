The variable `v` is assigned a new list that is created by mapping `int` to each component of the input split string. The input string will contain `n` integers that represent the volumes of kvass in the kegs. The state of `n`, `s`, and the values of `v` will change according to the user input, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to user input, `s` is a positive integer equal to user input, `v` is a list of `n` integers equal to the integers input by the user.**
