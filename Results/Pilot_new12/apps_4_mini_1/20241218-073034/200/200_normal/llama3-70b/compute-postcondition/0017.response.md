Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to user input; `s` is a positive integer equal to user input; `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v, and total is less than `s`. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is updated to the value of `mid` and `high` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `low` is still less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high + 1) // 2, and `high` is updated to mid - 1.***
