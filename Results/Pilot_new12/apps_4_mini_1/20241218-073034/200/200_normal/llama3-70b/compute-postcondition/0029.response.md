Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, representing the largest integer such that the sum of min(`low`, `x`) for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`; if the sum is not equal to `s`, the code prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of `low`, which is equal to `high`, while the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `total` is less than or equal to `s`.***
