Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to user input; `s` is a positive integer equal to user input; `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers. If `total`, calculated as the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element in `v`, is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, resulting in `total` being greater than or equal to `s`.***
