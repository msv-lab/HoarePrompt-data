The list `v` is sorted in ascending order, meaning the order of its elements has changed based on their values. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it still represents the input size of the list `v`, and `s` is also unchanged. The specific values of `v` will now be in sorted order. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to user input, `s` is a positive integer equal to user input, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers.**
