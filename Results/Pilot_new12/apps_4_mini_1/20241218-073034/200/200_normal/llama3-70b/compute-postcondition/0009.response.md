Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to user input; `s` is a positive integer equal to user input; `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `low` is 0; `high` is greater than 0; `mid` is equal to `(0 + high + 1) // 2; `total` is equal to `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v); `total` is greater than or equal to `s`.***
