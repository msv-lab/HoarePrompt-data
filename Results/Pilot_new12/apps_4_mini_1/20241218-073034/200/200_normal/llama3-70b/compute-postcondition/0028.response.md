Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, representing the largest integer such that the sum of min(`low`, `x`) for each `x` in `v` is equal to `s`; values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged; `total` is at least less than or equal to `s`; `print(low)` outputs the value of `low`, which is equal to `high`.**
