According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. For the loop to execute, `low` must be less than `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum value in the list `v`. Given that `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the minimum value in `v` must be greater than 0 in order for `low` (which is 0) to be less than `high`.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we must adjust the state so that the minimum value in `v` is greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to user input; `s` is a positive integer equal to user input; `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `low` is 0; `high` must be greater than 0**
