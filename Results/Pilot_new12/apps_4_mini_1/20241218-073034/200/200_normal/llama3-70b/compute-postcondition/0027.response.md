Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, representing the largest integer such that the sum of min(`low`, `x`) for each `x` in `v` is equal to `s`. The loop has terminated since `low` is no longer less than `high`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as the original user inputs. `total` is at least less than or equal to `s` at the last comparison, and the specific values of `total`, `low`, and `high` depend on all iterations made of the loop restrictions that were in effect during execution.***
