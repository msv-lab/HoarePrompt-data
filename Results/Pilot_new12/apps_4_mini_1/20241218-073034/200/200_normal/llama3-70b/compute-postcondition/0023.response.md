Postcondition: ***`n` and `s` are positive integers equal to user input. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, and `high` remains greater than `low` while `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` remains less than `high`, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
