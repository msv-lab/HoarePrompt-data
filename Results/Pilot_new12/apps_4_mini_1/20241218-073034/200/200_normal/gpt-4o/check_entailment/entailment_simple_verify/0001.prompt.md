You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the provided code.

### Problem Summary
1. We are given `n` kegs with volumes `v_i` liters of kvass each.
2. The Fair Nut wants to pour `s` liters of kvass.
3. The goal is to maximize the volume of kvass remaining in the keg that has the least volume after pouring `s` liters.

### Key Points in the Problem Description:
- If it's impossible to pour `s` liters (i.e., the total volume of all kegs is less than `s`), we should return `-1`.
- Otherwise, we should return the maximum possible kvass that could remain in the least full keg after pouring.

### Code Explanation:
1. The input is read and parsed into the number of kegs and the desired volume to pour.
2. The volumes of each keg are sorted.
3. The total volume of kvass in all kegs is calculated.
4. If the total volume is less than `s`, the code correctly outputs `-1`.
5. If pouring is possible, the code attempts to maximize the least keg's volume:
   - It identifies the smallest keg and simulates pouring from larger kegs into the smallest keg to minimize the reduction.
   - The amount poured from larger kegs is calculated against the remaining kvass needed.

### Test for Potential Issues:
Now let's consider a potential failure case:

**Test Case**
- Number of kegs `n = 3`, desired volume `s = 3`
- Volumes `v = [1, 1, 1]`

**Expected Output:**
- The total volume of kvass is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which equals `s`. However, even though the total is sufficient, after attempting to pour `3` liters from kegs where each has only `1` liter, we will not be able to meet the requirement since no keg has enough kvass to pour.

### Potential Issue in Code:
In the existing code, the `remaining_kvass` calculation does not account for cases where not enough kvass is available in each keg to satisfy the pouring requirement. Therefore, while the total volume check is correct, subsequent logic fails in calculating the minimum kvass in the end keg properly, leading to incorrect results in such edge cases.

Hence, let's provide the final assessment.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Failure
The program incorrectly calculates the minimum kvass remaining when the kegs do not contain enough kvass to satisfy the pouring requirement even though it checks for total volume initially. In the provided failing test case, it does not output `-1`, thus leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, s is a non-negative integer in the range 1 to 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_kvass` is 0, `total_volume` remains greater than or equal to `s`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. The conditions `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop remain satisfied.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `s` is a non-negative integer in the range 1 to 10^12, `v` is a list of `n` integers in the range 1 to 10^9, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the output is -1. Otherwise, if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, and the value of `min_keg_volume` is printed, ensuring that `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `n` remains in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop.
