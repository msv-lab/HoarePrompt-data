You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we can outline the expected behavior and then carefully analyze the code for any potential issues.

### Problem Summary:
The Fair Nut has `n` kegs of kvass, and he wants to pour exactly `s` liters of kvass while maximizing the volume in the least full keg. If it's not possible to pour `s` liters, the function should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of kegs `n` and the required volume `s`. It also reads the volumes of each keg and stores them in a list.

2. **Total Volume Check**: The function sums up the total kvass available in all kegs. If this total is less than `s`, it returns `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Kegs Sorting**: The program sorts the kegs. This is important for determining the minimum possible volume remaining in the least filled keg after pouring.

4. **Pouring Logic**:
   - The algorithm attempts to pour from the kegs, starting from the keg with the lowest volume.
   - If there's an opportunity to pour from the current keg without creating a negative volume in the keg below the minimum, it calculates how much can be taken.

5. **Minimum Keg Volume Calculation**: If after attempting to pour `s` liters, there is remaining kvass to be poured, the minimum keg volume is adjusted accordingly.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Exact Pour Case**: When the total kvass is exactly `s`. For instance, if all kegs have 5 liters and `s` is 15 for 3 kegs, it should return 5.
2. **Small Varying Keg Volumes**: When kegs vary greatly in volume but still sum to `s`, e.g., kegs of volumes [1, 1, 10] and wanting to take 2 liters should not allow a keg to go negative.
3. **Pours That Would Lead to Negative Volumes**: If after all possible pours only a negative volume could result in the least keg, it should still return `min_keg_volume`.

### Example Cases to Debug:
1. When `n = 3`, `s = 8` and keg volumes are `[3, 3, 3]`. This should return `-1` because it's impossible to pour 8 liters.
  
2. For `n = 4`, `s = 3` and volumes are `[0, 0, 0, 3]`, the output should be `0`, as one keg is full and the others are empty, but this case should still be valid to check.

### Critical Findings:
- The current logic assumes that pouring can always be evenly distributed or follow a simple minimum check. 
- The adjustment of `min_keg_volume` during the pour logic does not take into account all possible distributions, especially when `remaining_kvass` might not be evenly divisible among all kegs leading to inconsistencies.
- There's potential for negative results on certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has logical flaws particularly in how it handles the pouring and minimum keg logic. 

Correctness: **False**. 

A case where the program would fail is when the total kvass is enough, but managing the volumes could lead to impossible distributions, such as exactly reaching zero on multiple iterations leading to the assumption that negative distributions can occur.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, s is a non-negative integer in the range 1 to 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_kvass` is 0, `total_volume` remains greater than or equal to `s`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. The conditions `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop remain satisfied.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `s` is a non-negative integer in the range 1 to 10^12, `v` is a list of `n` integers in the range 1 to 10^9, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the output is -1. Otherwise, if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, and the value of `min_keg_volume` is printed, ensuring that `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `n` remains in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `s`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing volumes. It calculates the total volume of the kegs. If the total volume is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. If the total volume is sufficient, it attempts to reduce the volume of the smallest keg (the minimum keg volume) by distributing the excess needed volume (`remaining_kvass`) across the other kegs. The final printed result is either the adjusted minimum keg volume or remains unchanged if no adjustment was necessary. The function ensures that after execution, the total volume remains sufficient to meet or exceed `s`, while also considering the possible adjustments based on the remaining kvass volume. The function does not have an explicit return value but produces output based on conditions within the code.
