To determine the correctness of the program against the provided problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two integers `n` and `s`, and then it reads a list of integers `volumes`, which contains the amount of kvass in each keg. This matches the problem description which specifies the inputs.

2. **Total Volume Check**: The program calculates the `total_volume` of kvass in all kegs. This is done using a `sum()` on the `volumes` list. If the `total_volume` is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. This adheres to the requirement that if the Fair Nut cannot pour `s` liters, the output must be `-1`.

3. **Finding Minimum Keg Volume**: If the `total_volume` is sufficient, the program aims to find out how much kvass can remain in the least keg after pouring `s` liters. It does this by checking each keg in a sorted order of the volumes. If a keg's volume is greater than the `min_keg_volume`, it calculates how much kvass can potentially be taken from that keg without reducing it below the minimum.

4. **Distributing Remaining Kvass**: After attempting to take kvass from kegs larger than the minimum, if any `remaining_kvass` is left (indicating that some kvass couldn't be poured while maintaining `min_keg_volume`), the program redistributes this `remaining_kvass` evenly across all kegs by adjusting `min_keg_volume`. Specifically, it decreases the `min_keg_volume` by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, which ensures that the minimum remaining volume accounts properly for the integer division.

5. **Output the Result**: Finally, it prints the resulting `min_keg_volume`, which indicates the maximum amount of kvass that can remain in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters, according to the given conditions.

### Correctness Evaluation
- The program correctly implements the logic as outlined in the problem description. It ensures:
  - If total kvass is insufficient, it returns `-1`.
  - If sufficient, it finds the maximum possible volume remaining in the least filled keg after distributing the amount poured (`s`) from the kegs.

### Edge Cases
- The logic accounts for cases where the total kvass can be exactly equal to `s`, allowing for zero remaining kvass.
- It also handles large input sizes efficiently due to Python's capability to manage large integers for `s`, up to `10^12`.

Therefore, considering all of the above points, the program consistently adheres to the outlined requirements and handles potential cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
