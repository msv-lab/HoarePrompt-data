The code `n, s = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splitting it into two values which are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `s`. Given the initial conditions, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 10^12.

After execution:
- The previous value of `n` in the range of 1 to 1000 is now updated to an input value (which is also an integer).
- The previous value of `s`, which was a non-negative integer in the specified range, is also updated to an input value, thus remaining a non-negative integer.

Since both `n` and `s` are now assigned values based on user input, the specific previous values cannot be retained; however, their ranges remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000 (updated to user input), `s` is a non-negative integer in the range 1 to 10^12 (updated to user input), and `v` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9.**
