The code `remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take` updates the value of `remaining_kvass` by subtracting the current value of `possible_to_take` from it. The initial value of `remaining_kvass` is `0`, and `possible_to_take` is also `0`. Therefore, after the operation, `remaining_kvass` will remain `0`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 1000, `i` is 2, `remaining_kvass` is 0, and `possible_to_take` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 1000, `i` is 2, `remaining_kvass` is 0, `possible_to_take` is 0.**
