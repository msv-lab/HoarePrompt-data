Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 1000, `i` is 2, and `remaining_kvass` is 0. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the conditions unchanged. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to 0 while `remaining_kvass` remains 0.***
