The code snippet `break` indicates that the program will exit the loop it is currently in. The values of the variables themselves do not change, but the execution flow alters. The relevant variables, as stated in the initial state, are `n`, `i`, `remaining_kvass`, and the array `volumes`.

- `n` is still an integer in the range of 1 to 1000.
- `i` is still 0.
- `remaining_kvass` is still 0.
- The conditions regarding `volumes[i]` and `min_keg_volume` also remain applicable; however, since the operation involves breaking out of the loop, further processing on those values does not occur.

Therefore, we maintain the original states without change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop.**
