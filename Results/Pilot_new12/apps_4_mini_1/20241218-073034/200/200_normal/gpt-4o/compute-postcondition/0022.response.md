The code `remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take` decrements the value of `remaining_kvass` by the value of `possible_to_take`. Given the initial state, `remaining_kvass` is initially 0, and `possible_to_take` is also 0. Therefore, after executing this line, `remaining_kvass` remains 0 (0 - 0 = 0).

The other variables `n` and `i` retain their original values, while `possible_to_take` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 1, `remaining_kvass` is 0, and `possible_to_take` is 0.**
