The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `remaining_kvass` remain unchanged, and the flow of the program will continue after the loop without executing any further iterations in it. Given the current context, where `remaining_kvass` may be 0 and no updates were made to it or the other variables, the output state remains the same regarding those values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 1, `remaining_kvass` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
