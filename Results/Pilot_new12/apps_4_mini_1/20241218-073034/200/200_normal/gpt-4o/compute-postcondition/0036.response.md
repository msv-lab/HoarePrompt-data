Postcondition: ***If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. The conditions `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop remain satisfied.***
