The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead, it skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, `i` remains unchanged as it was not incremented or modified by the `continue`. The output state reflects that the loop continues its execution without any change to the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume` and continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
