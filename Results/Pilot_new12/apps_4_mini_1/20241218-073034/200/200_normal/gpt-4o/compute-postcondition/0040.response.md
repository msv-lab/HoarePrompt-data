Functionality: **The function takes no parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `s`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing volumes. It calculates the total volume of the kegs. If the total volume is less than `s`, it prints `-1`. If the total volume is sufficient, it attempts to reduce the volume of the smallest keg (the minimum keg volume) by distributing the excess needed volume (`remaining_kvass`) across the other kegs. The final printed result is either the adjusted minimum keg volume or remains unchanged if no adjustment was necessary. The function ensures that after execution, the total volume remains sufficient to meet or exceed `s`, while also considering the possible adjustments based on the remaining kvass volume. The function does not have an explicit return value but produces output based on conditions within the code.**
