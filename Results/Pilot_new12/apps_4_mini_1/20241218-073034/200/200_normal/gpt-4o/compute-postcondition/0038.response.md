Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `s` is a non-negative integer in the range 1 to 10^12, `v` is a list of `n` integers in the range 1 to 10^9, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the output is -1. Otherwise, if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, and the value of `min_keg_volume` is printed, ensuring that `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `n` remains in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `volumes` contains the utilized volumes based on the condition of the loop.***
