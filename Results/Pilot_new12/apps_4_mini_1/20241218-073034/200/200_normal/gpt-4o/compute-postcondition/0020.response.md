The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. In this case, it does not change any values of the existing variables. The execution will move to the next iteration of the loop where `n`, `i`, and `remaining_kvass` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 1, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 1, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
