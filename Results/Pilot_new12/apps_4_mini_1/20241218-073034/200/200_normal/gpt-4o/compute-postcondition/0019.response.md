According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 1, and `remaining_kvass` is 0**
