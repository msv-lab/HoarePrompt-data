The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration. Since no changes occur to the variables outside the context of a loop, the output state remains unchanged. Therefore, `n`, `i`, and `remaining_kvass` retain their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 1000, `i` is 2, and `remaining_kvass` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
