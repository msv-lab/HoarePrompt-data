To determine the Output State after executing the code provided, we need to analyze the line of code in the context of the initial state given.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 1000,
- `i` is 2,
- `remaining_kvass` is 0.

The line of code is:
```
possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
```

- Here, `i` is 2. Therefore, `volumes[i]` will refer to the third element in the `volumes` list, and since `remaining_kvass` is 0, the calculation involves taking the minimum of `volumes[2] - min_keg_volume` and 0.
- `possible_to_take` will take the lesser of these two values. If `volumes[2] - min_keg_volume` is greater than 0, then `possible_to_take` will be assigned 0, as `remaining_kvass` is currently 0.

The value of `possible_to_take` does not return any particular value into any variable as part of state output.

As a result, the initial state of the variables remains largely intact, but we know that:
- `possible_to_take` will be `0` due to the fact that the second argument is `0` and `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` would not affect it.

Thus, the final Output State would reflect the unchanged variables, and we indicate that:
- `possible_to_take` has been computed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 1000, `i` is 2, `remaining_kvass` is 0, `possible_to_take` is 0.**
