According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1, which it is given to be in the range of 1 to 1000. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration up to `n-1`.

Since the given state includes `n` as an integer in the range 1 to 1000 and starts the loop from `i = 0`, this implies that `i` can be adjusted to reflect the starting point of the loop after the first iteration.

Therefore, the necessary state adjustments before the loop starts will be:

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0**
