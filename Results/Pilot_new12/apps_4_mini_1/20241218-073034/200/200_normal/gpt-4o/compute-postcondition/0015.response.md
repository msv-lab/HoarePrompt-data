Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000 and `i` is 0. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`, `possible_to_take` is equal to `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)` and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.***
