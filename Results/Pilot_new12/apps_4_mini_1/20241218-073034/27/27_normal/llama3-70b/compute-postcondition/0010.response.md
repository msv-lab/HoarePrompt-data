The value of `a10` is assigned the result of `z` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `x`. The values of variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, but `a10` is computed based on these values. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `z`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a8` is equal to `(y`; `a9` is equal to `z` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `y`; `a10` is equal to `z` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `x`.**
