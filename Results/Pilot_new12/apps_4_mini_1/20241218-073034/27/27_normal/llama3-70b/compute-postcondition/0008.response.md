The variable `a8` is assigned the value `(y ** z) ** x`. Given that `y`, `z`, and `x` are real numbers within the range of 0.1 to 200.0, `a8` becomes equal to `(y raised to the power of z) raised to the power of x`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `z`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a8` is equal to `(y ** z) ** x`.**
