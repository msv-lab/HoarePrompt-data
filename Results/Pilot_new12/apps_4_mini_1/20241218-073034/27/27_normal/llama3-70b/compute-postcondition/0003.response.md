The value of `a3` is assigned the expression `(x ** y) ** z`. The previous values of `a1` and `a2` are not affected. Here's how `a3` is calculated: first, `x` is raised to the power of `y`, then that result is raised to the power of `z`. This means `a3 = (x ** y) ** z` can also be expressed using the properties of exponents as `a3 = x ** (y * z)`. 

The output state includes the definitions of `a1`, `a2`, and the newly computed value of `a3`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `(x ** y) ** z`, which is equal to `x ** (y * z)`.**
