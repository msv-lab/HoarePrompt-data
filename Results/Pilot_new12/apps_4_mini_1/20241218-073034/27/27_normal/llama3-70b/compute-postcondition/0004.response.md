The code assigns `a4` the value of `(x ** z) ** y`. The only variable being updated is `a4`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain within the given range of 0.1 to 200.0. Thus, `a4` becomes `x` raised to the power of `z`, then raised to the power of `y`, based on the properties of exponents.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `(x ** z) ** y`.**
