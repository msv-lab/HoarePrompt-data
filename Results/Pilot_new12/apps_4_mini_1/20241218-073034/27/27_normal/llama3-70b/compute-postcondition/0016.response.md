The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition; however, it is implied that it operates on the real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` which must meet the constraints of being within the range of 0.1 to 200.0, each represented with exactly one digit after the decimal point. Since there is no additional output specified in the provided information, I will focus on the constraints.
