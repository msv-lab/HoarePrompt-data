The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`, or \( a2 = x^{(z^y)} \). The value of `a1` remains unaffected but can be understood as \( x^{(y^z)} \). The other variables `x`, `y`, and `z` retain their original bounds. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`; `a2` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `z` raised to the power of `y`.**
