The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`, which can be represented mathematically as \( x^{(y^z)} \). The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged after this operation, but `a1` is now defined in terms of these variables.

Since \(0.1 \leq x, y, z \leq 200.0\), the value of `a1` will be a real number based on the computed expression. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0; `a1` is equal to `x` raised to the power of `y` raised to the power of `z`, or \( x^{(y^z)} \)**.
