Correctness: **True**

The provided program reads three space-separated real numbers (x, y, z) and calculates twelve specific expressions involving these numbers as defined in the problem description. It then finds the maximum value among those expressions and retrieves the corresponding index to output the correct expression format. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts valid floating-point inputs for x, y, and z within the specified range (0.1 to 200.0) and ensures that each number is in the correct format (exactly one digit after the decimal point).

2. **Expression Calculation**: The expressions calculated by the program include all twelve specified combinations according to the problem statement.

3. **Determination of Maximum**: The program uses Python built-in functions to find the maximum value and its corresponding index correctly. It handles ties correctly by choosing the smallest index.

4. **Output Format**: The output format matches the specifications given in the problem description for expressions with and without parentheses.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program also appears to handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all inputs are the same, the output will correctly identify the first expression, which is x^y^z.

As all specified requirements are met and there are no provided edge cases that cause the program to fail or behave incorrectly, the conclusion is that the program is indeed correct.
