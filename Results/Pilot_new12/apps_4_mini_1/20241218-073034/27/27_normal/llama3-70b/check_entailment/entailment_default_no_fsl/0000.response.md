Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of multiple maximum values. According to the problem description, if there are multiple maximums, the program should print the expression corresponding to the first occurrence based on the order defined in the output list. However, the current implementation uses the `index` method on the maximum value, which will only give the index of the first occurrence if the maximum value appears multiple times in the list. This can lead to incorrect outputs when identical maximum values occur.

For example, if the input were `2.0 2.0 2.0`, both `x^y^z` and `y^x^z` would yield the same maximum value. The program will print `y^x^z` instead of `x^y^z`, which is incorrect since `x^y^z` is listed first.

This bug demonstrates that the program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases, thus leading to an overall assessment of incorrectness.
