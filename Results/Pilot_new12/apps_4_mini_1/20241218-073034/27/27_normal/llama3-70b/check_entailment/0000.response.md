Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a flaw in how it determines which expression corresponds to the maximum value. Specifically, the program does not account for the case when multiple expressions yield the same maximum value. According to the problem statement, if there are multiple maximums, it should print the expression that comes first in the list.

For example, consider the input:
```
4.0 2.0 2.0
```
The calculations yield:
- a1 = 4.0^(2.0^(2.0)) = 16
- a2 = 4.0^(2.0^(2.0)) = 16
- a3 = (4.0^(2.0))^(2.0) = 16
- a4 = (4.0^(2.0))^(2.0) = 16
- a5 = 2.0^(4.0^(2.0)) = 16
- a6 = 2.0^(2.0^(4.0)) > 16
- a7 = (2.0^(4.0))^(2.0) > 16
- a8 = (2.0^(2.0))^(4.0) > 16
- a9 = 2.0^(4.0) > 16
- a10 = 2.0^(4.0) > 16
- a11 = (2.0^(4.0))^(2.0) > 16
- a12 = (2.0^(2.0))^(4.0) > 16

In this case, several values will yield 16, but the program will only return the first occurrence of the maximum value found in the list of calculations. This is inadequate because the maximum values should regard the approach to selecting the first occurrence properly when multiple maximum values match.

Thus, the output for the above case will not represent the correct expression based on the established rules in the problem statement.
