You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:  a_1 = x^{y}^{z};  a_2 = x^{z}^{y};  a_3 = (x^{y})^{z};  a_4 = (x^{z})^{y};  a_5 = y^{x}^{z};  a_6 = y^{z}^{x};  a_7 = (y^{x})^{z};  a_8 = (y^{z})^{x};  a_9 = z^{x}^{y};  a_10 = z^{y}^{x};  a_11 = (z^{x})^{y};  a_12 = (z^{y})^{x}. 

Let m be the maximum of all the a_{i}, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that a_{c} = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that a_{c}.

 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.


-----Output-----

Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity). 


-----Examples-----
Input
1.1 3.4 2.5

Output
z^y^x

Input
2.0 2.0 2.0

Output

Input

Program:

def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(float, input().split())
    a1 = x ** y ** z
    a2 = x ** z ** y
    a3 = (x ** y) ** z
    a4 = (x ** z) ** y
    a5 = y ** x ** z
    a6 = y ** z ** x
    a7 = (y ** x) ** z
    a8 = (y ** z) ** x
    a9 = z ** x ** y
    a10 = z ** y ** x
    a11 = (z ** x) ** y
    a12 = (z ** y) ** x
    a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]
    b = ['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z', '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']
    print(b[a.index(max(a))])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a flaw in how it determines which expression corresponds to the maximum value. Specifically, the program does not account for the case when multiple expressions yield the same maximum value. According to the problem statement, if there are multiple maximums, it should print the expression that comes first in the list.

For example, consider the input:
```
4.0 2.0 2.0
```
The calculations yield:
- a1 = 4.0^(2.0^(2.0)) = 16
- a2 = 4.0^(2.0^(2.0)) = 16
- a3 = (4.0^(2.0))^(2.0) = 16
- a4 = (4.0^(2.0))^(2.0) = 16
- a5 = 2.0^(4.0^(2.0)) = 16
- a6 = 2.0^(2.0^(4.0)) > 16
- a7 = (2.0^(4.0))^(2.0) > 16
- a8 = (2.0^(2.0))^(4.0) > 16
- a9 = 2.0^(4.0) > 16
- a10 = 2.0^(4.0) > 16
- a11 = (2.0^(4.0))^(2.0) > 16
- a12 = (2.0^(2.0))^(4.0) > 16

In this case, several values will yield 16, but the program will only return the first occurrence of the maximum value found in the list of calculations. This is inadequate because the maximum values should regard the approach to selecting the first occurrence properly when multiple maximum values match.

Thus, the output for the above case will not represent the correct expression based on the established rules in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three real numbers x, y, and z as input, ensuring they fall within the range of 0.1 to 200.0 and have one decimal place. It computes various exponentiation combinations of these numbers, specifically twelve different expressions, and determines which of these combinations results in the highest value. Finally, the function prints the corresponding mathematical expression representing this maximum value. However, the function lacks error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values, values outside the specified range) and assumes valid input is always provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
