Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the requirements set forth in the problem description. Although it correctly computes the various expressions derived from x, y, and z, it contains a few issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function attempts to read input using `sys.stdin.read`, but `sys` is not imported in the code. Thus, this will raise a `NameError` at runtime because `sys` is undefined.

2. **Output Format**: The problem specifies that expressions like `x^y^z` should be outputted without parentheses, while expressions like `(x^y)^z` must use parentheses. The output expressions are hardcoded in `expressions` list, but even if it was correct, there was a mistake in the printing of the expressions, especially in the way expressions are represented. 

3. **Tie Handling**: In case of multiple maximum values, the program uses the `max` function which correctly identifies the first maximum by order because it will select based on the first occurrence in case of ties. However, it only explicitly covers the case where `max_value` might have multiple corresponding expressions. The problem description requires the printing of the first occurrence explicitly, and it doesn't verify that in the way the code is set up (especially in cases with multiple maximum values).

As a result of these issues, the program does not implement the problem's requirements correctly across all edges and possible scenarios. Therefore, the final output does not satisfy the problem description fully and is marked as incorrect.
