Final: **False**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** is accurate because the program fails to handle tie cases correctly when determining the maximum expression. As stated in the problem description, if multiple expressions yield the same maximum value, the program must return the first one that appears in the list. The use of `max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])` does not guarantee that the first occurrence of the maximum is returned in the event of a tie; it only retrieves the maximum value found first in the iteration without accounting for duplicates. This flaw results in incorrect behavior, as illustrated in the provided example where both `x^y^z` and `y^x^z` evaluate to the same maximum value. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.
