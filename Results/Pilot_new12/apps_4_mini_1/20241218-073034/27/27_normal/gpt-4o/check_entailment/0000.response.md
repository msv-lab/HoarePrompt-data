Correctness: **False**.

The program has a fundamental oversight regarding the way it calculates the maximum value among the expressions. It does not correctly handle cases where different expressions result in the same maximum value. According to the problem description, if multiple expressions yield the same maximum value, the program should return the one that appears first in the list of expressions.

To illustrate this flaw, consider an example:

Input:
```
2.0 2.0 2.0
```

Both `x^y^z` and `y^x^z` would evaluate to 8.0, and since both yield the maximum value, the program should return `x^y^z`, which is the first expression. However, since the program uses `max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])`, it does not guarantee that it returns the first occurrence of a maximum value in case of a tie since `max()` returns the first maximum it encounters.

Thus, the logic for handling ties in finding the maximum is missing, leading to incorrect behavior in such scenarios.

An example output which demonstrates this would not meet the expectation set by the problem description proves the program's correctness as False.
