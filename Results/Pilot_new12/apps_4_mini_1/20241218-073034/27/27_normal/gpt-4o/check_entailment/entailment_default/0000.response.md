The provided program is intended to compute the maximum value from a set of specified mathematical expressions involving three positive real numbers, \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), and print the corresponding expression that produces this maximum. The problem description specifies that the inputs will always be valid and within the specified range [0.1, 200.0].

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from standard input and assumes valid formatting as per the problem description.
2. **Expression Calculation**: The code constructs a list of tuples containing both the computed expression values and their corresponding string representations.
3. **Finding Maximum**: The code uses the `max` function with a custom key to determine the maximum value among the computed expressions and captures the associated expression that corresponds to this maximum value.
4. **Output Formatting**: The output format systematically represents the mathematical expressions according to the specification provided in the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
The program evaluates various permutations of expressions and should handle any variations in the magnitude of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) effectively due to Python's ability to compute floating-point arithmetic and exponentiation without encountering overflow issues within the defined bounds.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully meets the requirements of the problem description for all specified cases as it computes the maximum value correctly and formats the corresponding expression per the instructions. There are no visible logical flaws or unhandled cases based on the description provided.

Correctness: **True**.
