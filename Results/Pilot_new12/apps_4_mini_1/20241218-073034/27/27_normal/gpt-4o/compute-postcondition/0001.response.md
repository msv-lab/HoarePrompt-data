The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values read from standard input, but since the specific values are unknown, we cannot determine them directly. The states of `x`, `y`, and `z` will now reflect the new assigned values from the input. The previous values are discarded. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are now equal to the input values from standard input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the new values read from standard input**
