The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on three positive real numbers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are given to be within the range of [0.1, 200.0] and represented with exactly one digit after the decimal point. The functionality of the function does not provide specific outputs based on these inputs, as there is no output provided for this function in the prompt. Consequently, we cannot specify the return values or behavior based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not have specified output behavior based on the inputs.**
