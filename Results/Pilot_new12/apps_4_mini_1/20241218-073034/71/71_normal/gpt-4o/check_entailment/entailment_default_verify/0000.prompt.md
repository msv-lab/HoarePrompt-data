You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we should test it against potential edge cases and verify that it meets the requirements.

1. **Understanding the requirements**:
   - The program should determine the minimum number of digits to delete from an integer `n` such that the remaining number is divisible by \(10^k\).
   - The resulting number shouldn't have leading zeros unless the result is exactly zero.
   - It needs to handle cases correctly where the number is already very close to the required format and where, after removal, it cannot start with unnecessary zeros.

2. **Reviewing the code**:
   - The code counts trailing zeros and counts how many other digits are in the way of achieving the required zeros.
   - The program breaks out of the loop if it finds enough zeros (i.e., `count_zeros == k`) and prints the number of digits that need to be removed.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - **Case where n has fewer zeros than required**: If `n` doesn't have `k` zeros, the program would fail to provide a correct output since it prints `len(n) - 1` (this may not match the actual required deletions).
   - **Leading zeros**: The check for leading zeros is not actually implemented; the function should also ensure that the remaining number doesn’t start with unnecessary zeros.

Let's consider the edge case:
- **Input**: `n = 2000, k = 3` (the number already has 3 trailing zeros).
   - Expected output: `0` (no digits to remove).
   - Actual output: `0` (correct).

However, the edge case where `n = 123456`, `k = 3` should yield `3` since we cannot form a number divisible by \(10^3\) without attaining at least three zeros, leading to an output that doesn’t align with the described functionality.

Through this analysis, we can conclude that the provided program does not adequately handle cases where it lacks enough zeros to reach `k`, and it skips validating a number for leading zeros after removing digits.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k` from input. It counts the number of trailing zeros in `n`, determining how many non-zero digits were encountered before reaching `k` zeros. If exactly `k` zeros are found at the end of `n`, it outputs the count of non-zero digits found before the zeros. If the number of zeros is less than `k`, it outputs the length of the string `n` minus one (which considers all digits but one). Therefore, the function effectively calculates a measure based on the number of zeros and non-zero digits in the input number `n`, with specific handling when the conditions are not met. The function has no defined return value and instead prints the result directly to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
