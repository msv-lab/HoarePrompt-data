Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for all possible cases described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to handle situations where the resulting number must not start with an unnecessary leading zero unless it is zero itself.

### Example Case 1:
- Input: `100 2`
- Expected Output: `1` (Remove one '0' to get '10', which is divisible by 100)
- Program Output: `2` (It counts the removal of both '1' and '0', which is incorrect)

### Example Case 2:
- Input: `21000 3`
- Expected Output: `0` (The number already has three trailing zeros)
- Program Output: `3` (It incorrectly counts the zeros as needing removal)

### Explanation:
The logic in the code does not account for the fact that if zeros are leading the result, they can only appear in the case where the result is exactly `0`. Additionally, the handling of trailing zeros needs to be more refined to ensure that we are only considering numbers that are valid in their formation after the desired digits are removed. The program incorrectly concludes results in these and potentially other cases. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not satisfy all the requirements in the problem description.
