You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for all possible cases described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to handle situations where the resulting number must not start with an unnecessary leading zero unless it is zero itself.

### Example Case 1:
- Input: `100 2`
- Expected Output: `1` (Remove one '0' to get '10', which is divisible by 100)
- Program Output: `2` (It counts the removal of both '1' and '0', which is incorrect)

### Example Case 2:
- Input: `21000 3`
- Expected Output: `0` (The number already has three trailing zeros)
- Program Output: `3` (It incorrectly counts the zeros as needing removal)

### Explanation:
The logic in the code does not account for the fact that if zeros are leading the result, they can only appear in the case where the result is exactly `0`. Additionally, the handling of trailing zeros needs to be more refined to ensure that we are only considering numbers that are valid in their formation after the desired digits are removed. The program incorrectly concludes results in these and potentially other cases. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not satisfy all the requirements in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9).
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in `n` (or `k` if `k` zeros were found), `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits checked before reaching `k` zeros (or total non-zero digits if `count_zeros` is less than `k`).
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer. If the number of zeros in `n` equals `k`, `to_remove` is printed. If the number of zeros in `n` is less than `k`, `to_remove` represents the non-zero digits checked before reaching `count_zeros`, and the output printed is `len(n) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k` from input. It counts the number of trailing zeros in `n`, determining how many non-zero digits were encountered before reaching `k` zeros. If exactly `k` zeros are found at the end of `n`, it outputs the count of non-zero digits found before the zeros. If the number of zeros is less than `k`, it outputs the length of the string `n` minus one (which considers all digits but one). Therefore, the function effectively calculates a measure based on the number of zeros and non-zero digits in the input number `n`, with specific handling when the conditions are not met. The function has no defined return value and instead prints the result directly to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
