The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. Since no information is provided about its previous value, we do not know what `to_remove` was originally, but we can state that it has increased by 1. The other variables, `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `digit`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is less than `k`, `digit` is the next digit of `n` in reversed order, `to_remove` is increased by 1.**
