The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. Since it was previously less than `k`, it will still be less than or equal to `k` after the increment. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is now greater than or equal to 1 (and less than or equal to `k`), and `digit` is the next digit of `n` in reversed order, which is one position earlier.**
