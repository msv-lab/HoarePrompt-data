The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and `to_remove` remains either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `digit`.
