Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer. If the number of zeros in `n` equals `k`, `to_remove` is printed. If the number of zeros in `n` is less than `k`, `to_remove` represents the non-zero digits checked before reaching `count_zeros`, and the output printed is `len(n) - 1`.***
