The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` using `input()` which accepts user input and `map(str, ...)` which converts the split input values to strings. Since `n` was a non-negative integer before and is now being set to a string representation of user input, its type changes accordingly. The initial constraints on `k` remain valid after the code has been executed, but `k` is also converted to a string.

Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect that both `n` and `k` are now strings, while retaining their original constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string, and n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9)**
