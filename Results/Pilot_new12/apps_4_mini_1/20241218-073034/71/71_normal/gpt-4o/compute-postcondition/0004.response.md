To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly, let's analyze the given state and the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over the digits of the string `n` in reverse order. 
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-empty string since reversing an empty string results in another empty string, which means the loop will not run.

Based on this understanding, we need to adjust the state such that:

- `n` should be a non-empty string to ensure that there are digits to reverse and iterate over.
- Since `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are initialized at 0, they will not affect the ability of the loop to execute but will represent their values after the loop starts.
- The variable `k`, being a positive integer, is not directly involved in the loop execution.

To summarize the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we can state:

State: **`n` must be a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**
