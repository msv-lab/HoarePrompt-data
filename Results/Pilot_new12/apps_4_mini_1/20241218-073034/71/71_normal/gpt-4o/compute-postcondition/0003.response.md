The variable `to_remove` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `count_zeros`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, and `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**.
