The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged and their states will be maintained. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is increased by 1, `to_remove` could be equal to the previous value, and we will process the digit one before the last processed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is increased by 1, `to_remove` could be equal to the previous value, and we will process the digit one before the last processed.**
