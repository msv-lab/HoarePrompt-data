The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `count_zeros`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `to_remove`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` remains unchanged, `to_remove` is increased by 1.**
