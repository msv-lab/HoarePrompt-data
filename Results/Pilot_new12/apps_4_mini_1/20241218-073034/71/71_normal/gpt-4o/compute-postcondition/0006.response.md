`count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count_zeros` is 0, so after the execution, `count_zeros` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, and the current value of `digit` is '0'.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, and the current value of `digit` is '0'**.
