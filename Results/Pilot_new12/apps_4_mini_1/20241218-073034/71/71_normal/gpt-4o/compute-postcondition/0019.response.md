According to the code, the loop iterates over the digits of the string `n` in reverse order. The loop continues as long as there are more digits in `n` to process. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is a non-empty string, which means there are still digits to process.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, no changes occur to `count_zeros` or `to_remove`. If `count_zeros` is less than `k`, `to_remove` increases by 1, and the loop or most internal if statement is exited.

However, since we're looking for the state at the beginning of the next loop iteration, we can assume that the next digit in the sequence will be processed. Thus, we should adjust the parameters accordingly. 

As we process the digits in reverse, the next digit we will look at will follow the last one processed.

Given this, if `count_zeros` was less than `k` during the last iteration, `to_remove` would have been increased by 1.

To summarize, since `n` is non-empty, we can infer:
- The `digit` for the next iteration will be the next one from the end of the string `n`.
- We must not change `count_zeros` or `to_remove` for the next iteration state if the flow exited.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` remains unchanged, `to_remove` could be equal to the previous value (if exited), and we will process the digit one before the last processed.**
