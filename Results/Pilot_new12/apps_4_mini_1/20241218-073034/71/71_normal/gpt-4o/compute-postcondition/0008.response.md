The value of `to_remove` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `digit`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions state that `to_remove` is 0, so after the increment, it becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 1, and the variable `digit` is not equal to '0'.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 1, and the variable `digit` is not equal to '0'**.
