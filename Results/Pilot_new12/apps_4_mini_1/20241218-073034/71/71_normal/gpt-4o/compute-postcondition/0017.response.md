Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, if `digit` is '0', then `count_zeros` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_zeros` is less than `k`, and `to_remove` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
