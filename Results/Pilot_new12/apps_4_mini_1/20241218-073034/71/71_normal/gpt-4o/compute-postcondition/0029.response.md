To evaluate the given code snippet, we first analyze the impact on the existing variables based on the initial state.

1. The code is `print(len(n) - 1)`.
2. `len(n)` will return the length of the string `n`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, `len(n)` is at least 1.
3. The expression `len(n) - 1` ultimately evaluates to the length of the string `n` minus 1.
4. The `print` function outputs this value but doesn't change any variable states.

Since `print` does not alter the values of `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, or `to_remove`, we maintain their values from the initial state, while also incorporating the outcome of the `print` statement.

The specific output of the print statement would be `len(n) - 1`, which we denote as a single variable to denote the output. However, since weâ€™re not explicitly stating the output in numerical format (as we don't have the specific value of `n`), we will just mention the outcome textually.

Thus, the Output State after the execution of the code is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is less than `k`, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits checked before reaching `count_zeros`, and the output printed is `len(n) - 1`.**
