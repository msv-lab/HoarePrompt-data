The variable `k` is assigned the value `int(k)`, which converts the string representation of `k` (a positive integer) into an actual integer. Since `k` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), the conversion will yield a valid integer value for `k`. The variable `n`, being a string and a non-negative integer, remains unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects that `k` is now an integer while keeping all other variable states intact.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a positive integer and is now an integer.**
