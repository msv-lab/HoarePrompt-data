The provided code snippet contains a `break` statement, which does not change any variable values but instead exits the most immediate loop or control structure, assuming there is one in context. Since the values of `count_zeros`, `to_remove`, and the string `n` remain unchanged, we maintain their existing states.

Since the `break` does not modify any variables directly or indirectly, it only affects the flow of control in the program without impacting the variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is unchanged, `to_remove` is unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
