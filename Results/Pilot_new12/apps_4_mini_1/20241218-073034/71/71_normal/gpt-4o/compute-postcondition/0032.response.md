Functionality: **The function reads a non-empty string representation of a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k` from input. It counts the number of trailing zeros in `n`, determining how many non-zero digits were encountered before reaching `k` zeros. If exactly `k` zeros are found at the end of `n`, it outputs the count of non-zero digits found before the zeros. If the number of zeros is less than `k`, it outputs the length of the string `n` minus one (which considers all digits but one). Therefore, the function effectively calculates a measure based on the number of zeros and non-zero digits in the input number `n`, with specific handling when the conditions are not met. The function has no defined return value and instead prints the result directly to the console.**
