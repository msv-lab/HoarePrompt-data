The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input. It counts how many digits must be removed from the end of `n` to make it a multiple of `10^k`. The count of removed digits, `w`, is then printed. If `n` is already a multiple of `10^k`, no digits are removed and `w` remains 0. The function handles non-negative integers for `n` and ensures `k` is within the specified range of 1 to 9. It does not handle cases such as providing invalid input (e.g., non-integers or out-of-range values) or executing without input, which could result in an error. The final output is the integer value of `w`, reflecting the number of digits removed.
