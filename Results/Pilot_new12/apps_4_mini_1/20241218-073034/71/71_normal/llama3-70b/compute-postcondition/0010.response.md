The value of `n` is modified by performing integer division of its previous value by 10. Since it is stated that `n` is the result of integer division of its previous value by 10 and that `n` was initially not a multiple of 10, the resulting value of `n` will be its previous value divided by 10. The variable `w` is also increased by 1. Other variables remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the result of the integer division of its previous value by 10 (not a multiple of 10), `w` is increased by 1**
