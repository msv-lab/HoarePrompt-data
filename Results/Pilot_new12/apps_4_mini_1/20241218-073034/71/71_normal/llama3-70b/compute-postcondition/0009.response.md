The value of `w` is increased by 1, while `n` remains unchanged based on its initial condition of being the result of integer division of its previous value by 10 (and it is confirmed that it is not a multiple of 10). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the result of integer division of its previous value by 10 (not a multiple of 10), `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the result of integer division of its previous value by 10 (not a multiple of 10), `w` is increased by 1**
