The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division of `n` by `10`. The condition states that `n` must not be divisible by `10`, so after this operation, the new value of `n` will be the result of `n // 10`, which is guaranteed to be an integer. The value of `w` is not affected other than its initial increment. Therefore, the output state will be updated to show the new value of `n` while retaining the condition about `w`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // 10`; `w` is increased by 1.**
