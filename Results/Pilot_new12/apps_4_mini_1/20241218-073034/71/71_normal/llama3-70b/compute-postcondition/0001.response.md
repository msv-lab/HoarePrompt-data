The variable `w` is initialized to 0. The states of `n` and `k` have been assigned values from input but remain unchanged due to the absence of operations involving them. Therefore, the Output State retains all relevant information about `n` and `k` while reflecting the updated value of `w`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 0 to 2,000,000,000; `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 9; `w` is 0**.
