To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `n % 10 ** k != 0`. This condition checks if `n` is not divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer in the range [0, 2,000,000,000]
- `k` is a positive integer in the range [1, 9]
- `w` is 0

For the loop to proceed, the condition `n % 10 ** k != 0` must be true. This means that the last `k` digits of `n` should not all be zero. 

Since `k` is a positive integer, it can take values from 1 to 9. Therefore, if `k = 1`, `n` should not end with a 0; if `k = 2`, `n` should not end with 00, and so on, up to `k = 9`, where `n` should not end with 000000000.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, you can either adjust `n` to a value that satisfies the condition or confirm that it cannot currently end with a sufficient number of zeros. Since `w` is 0 and does not appear to affect the loop, we only need to focus on `n` and `k`.

Therefore, to make the loop execute one time, we can adjust `n` such that it does not end with the appropriate number of zeros dictated by `k`. We don't have a specific value of `n` given, but we can generally state the adjustment.

If we set `n` to a number that doesnâ€™t satisfy the divisibility condition for whatever `k` is, it will allow the `while` loop to execute. 

Thus, we state:
State: **`n` must not be divisible by `10 ** k` for the current value of `k` and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9**.
