The function `func` does not accept any parameters but operates based on two constraints: `n` which is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 2,000,000,000, and `k` which is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 9. The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be clearly described without additional information about its behaviour or expected output based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, but it operates on a non-negative integer `n` within the range 0 to 2,000,000,000 and a positive integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= 9. The specific output or return values are not defined in the provided information.**
