The line of code `n //= 10` updates the value of `n` by performing integer division of `n` by `10`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is not equal to a multiple of `10`, we can conclude that the new value of `n` will no longer equal its previous value. The variable `w` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the result of integer division of its previous value by 10 (not a multiple of 10), `w` is increased by 1**
