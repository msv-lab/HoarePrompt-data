To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements
1. We need to remove the least number of digits from the number `n` such that the remaining number is divisible by \( 10^k \).
2. The resulting number should not have unnecessary leading zeros, except for the case where the result is the single digit `0`.

### Program Analysis
The function `func()` takes input values for `n` and `k` and initializes a counter `w` to track the number of digits removed. The main logic consists of a while loop that repeatedly checks if `n % 10 ** k` is not zero. If not, it increments `w` and performs integer division on `n` by 10. This process effectively removes the least significant digit of `n` until `n` becomes divisible by \( 10^k \).

### Issues with the Program
1. **Leading Zeroes**: The program does not ensure that the resulting number does not start with unnecessary leading zeroes, except in the case of the single-digit zero. It fails to handle cases where after removing digits, unintended leading zeros may be generated.
   
2. **Non-trivial Cases**: Let's consider an example:
   - For input `3010 2`, the expected output is `1`, because removing the last digit (0) gives `301`, which is not divisible by `100` (instead `300` is needed). Removing `1` changes it to `300`, which is correct. However, the output should reflect that only one must be removed in this scenario.
   
3. **General Logic Flaw**: The approach assumes that checking `n % 10 ** k` guarantees you will always end up with a valid number. This may not be the case unless you are also ensuring valid removals, which the current loop does not address robustly.

4. **Zero Handling**: When `k = 9` and `n = 1000000000`, the function fails to provide a comprehensive check for minimum deletions by assuming there is always a sufficient number of zeros without correctly evaluating the order of digits.

### Conclusion
Since the function does not appropriately handle leading zeros and fails on specific logical counts, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential test cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Counterexample**: For `n = 3010` and `k = 2`, it incorrectly treats the numbers when digits are removed and does not account for leading zeros appropriately.
