To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze the logic used in the function to ensure it aligns with the requirements given.

### Problem Summary:
- The task is to remove the least number of digits from a number \( n \) such that the resulting number is divisible by \( 10^k \).
- The result must not start with unnecessary leading zeros, except for the case where the final number is zero.

### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Loop Condition**: The while loop `while n % 10 ** k != 0:` checks if \( n \) is currently divisible by \( 10^k \). If not, it increases the count \( w \) (representing digits removed) and divides \( n \) by 10.
2. **Divisibility Check**: The loop continues until \( n \) becomes divisible by \( 10^k \), which ensures that the program correctly identifies how many digits need to be removed to achieve this state.
3. **Output**: The program prints the number of digits removed, \( w \).

### Analyzing Correctness:
- The loop effectively removes the least significant digits (the rightmost digits). This is appropriate because for a number to be divisible by \( 10^k \), it must end with at least \( k \) zeros.
- The operation `n //= 10` correctly removes the last digit, simulating the process of "digit removal" that the problem describes.
- The program ensures that the remaining number will only start with leading zeros if it is exactly zero, which aligns with the problem's constraints.

### Edge Cases:
- The guarantees in the problem state that it is always possible to find a valid \( w \), and since leading zeros are handled according to specifications, there should be no scenarios in the valid input ranges where the function fails.
  
Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as specified in the description. It counts and prints the minimum number of digits removed to make the number divisible by \( 10^k \).

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows the instructions and handles the given problem requirements. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
