You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements
1. We need to remove the least number of digits from the number `n` such that the remaining number is divisible by \( 10^k \).
2. The resulting number should not have unnecessary leading zeros, except for the case where the result is the single digit `0`.

### Program Analysis
The function `func()` takes input values for `n` and `k` and initializes a counter `w` to track the number of digits removed. The main logic consists of a while loop that repeatedly checks if `n % 10 ** k` is not zero. If not, it increments `w` and performs integer division on `n` by 10. This process effectively removes the least significant digit of `n` until `n` becomes divisible by \( 10^k \).

### Issues with the Program
1. **Leading Zeroes**: The program does not ensure that the resulting number does not start with unnecessary leading zeroes, except in the case of the single-digit zero. It fails to handle cases where after removing digits, unintended leading zeros may be generated.
   
2. **Non-trivial Cases**: Let's consider an example:
   - For input `3010 2`, the expected output is `1`, because removing the last digit (0) gives `301`, which is not divisible by `100` (instead `300` is needed). Removing `1` changes it to `300`, which is correct. However, the output should reflect that only one must be removed in this scenario.
   
3. **General Logic Flaw**: The approach assumes that checking `n % 10 ** k` guarantees you will always end up with a valid number. This may not be the case unless you are also ensuring valid removals, which the current loop does not address robustly.

4. **Zero Handling**: When `k = 9` and `n = 1000000000`, the function fails to provide a comprehensive check for minimum deletions by assuming there is always a sufficient number of zeros without correctly evaluating the order of digits.

### Conclusion
Since the function does not appropriately handle leading zeros and fails on specific logical counts, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential test cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Counterexample**: For `n = 3010` and `k = 2`, it incorrectly treats the numbers when digits are removed and does not account for leading zeros appropriately.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input. It counts how many digits must be removed from the end of `n` to make it a multiple of `10^k`. The count of removed digits, `w`, is then printed. If `n` is already a multiple of `10^k`, no digits are removed and `w` remains 0. The function handles non-negative integers for `n` and ensures `k` is within the specified range of 1 to 9. It does not handle cases such as providing invalid input (e.g., non-integers or out-of-range values) or executing without input, which could result in an error. The final output is the integer value of `w`, reflecting the number of digits removed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
