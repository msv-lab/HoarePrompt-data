Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `t` is 2. If `length` is less than 1, `current_cost` is decreased by `length - 1`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than 3, then `current_cost` is increased by `(length - 3)`.***
