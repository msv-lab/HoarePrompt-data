According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. The variable `length` will take on each value from the list `a` in turn. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must contain at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

Given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer, indicating the number of elements in `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
- Since `length` is taking values from `a`, it can be inferred that for the next iteration, `length` will be assigned the next integer in the list.

If we consider that `t` is already equal to 1, if `length` was less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` was increased by `-length`. It implies that during this last iteration, the `length` was either the first element of `a` or the current one being processed. 

Now, for the next iteration:
- The loop will take the next value in `a`. Since `n` is a positive integer, and `a` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue, then `n` must be greater than the current index of `length` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

So, we set:
- If this is the first element, `length` will become the second element in `a`, and `current_cost` might need to be adjusted depending on the new value of `length` and its comparison to `t - 1`.

Assuming that we are in a valid state and `length` is the last element processed, `length` will be the next element in `a` for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is increased by `-length` where `length` is the next element in `a`, assuming `a` has at least one more element.**
