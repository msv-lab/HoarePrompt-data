The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its current value. Here, `length` represents the next element in the list `a`, and `t` is a constant value set to 1. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `length - 2`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and `a` contains positive integers within the specified range, `length` is constrained within that range as well.

The new value of `current_cost` will be `current_cost + (length - 2)`. The other variables retain their previous values as they are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 2)`**.
