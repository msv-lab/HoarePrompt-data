Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, if `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to `t`, and if `n` is 0, then `current_cost` remains 0. Otherwise, the values of `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
