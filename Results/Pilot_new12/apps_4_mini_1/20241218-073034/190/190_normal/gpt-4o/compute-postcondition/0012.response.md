Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is at least 1. If the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 2), then the conditions of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `current_cost` hold true while ensuring the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 1.***
