Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, and `length` is the next positive integer from `a`. If `length < t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated by adding \(1 - length\). Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)`.***
