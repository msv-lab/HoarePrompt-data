The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. This does not change any of the other variables, including `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment to `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is now 2, `current_cost` is 0.**
