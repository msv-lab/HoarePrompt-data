The code assigns the value of `n` to the result of `int(input())`, which means `n` will take the value provided by the user through input. Since `n` is originally described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), after execution, `n` will have the value specified by the user input, which still falls within this range. The variable `a` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the user input, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is a positive integer such that 1 <= a[i] <= 100.**
