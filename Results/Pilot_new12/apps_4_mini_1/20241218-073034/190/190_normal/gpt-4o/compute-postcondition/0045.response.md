The variable `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `t - 1 - length`. Given that `t` is 2 and `length` is defined as the next integer in the list `a`, this means:

1. Calculate `t - 1`, which is `2 - 1 = 1`.
2. Thus, the expression simplifies to `1 - length`.
3. The final addition to `current_cost` is `current_cost += 1 - length`.

Since `length` is a specific integer from the list `a`, the value of `current_cost` will change depending on the value of `length`.

The other variables remain unchanged in the output state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers that must have at least one more integer remaining, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is 2, `length` is the next integer in the list `a`, and `current_cost` is updated as `current_cost + (1 - length)`.**
