Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 3, and `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 4` if `length` is greater than 4. The variable `length` is the first element in `a` and is greater than or equal to 2.***
