According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined in the for loop statement, which iterates over `t` from 1 to 100 (inclusive). Given the current state:

- `n` is a positive integer, which does not directly affect the execution of the loop but ensures that the list `a` is defined and has positive integers.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that each element in `a` is between 1 and 100.
- `min_cost` and `best_t` are initialized but do not affect the loop execution.

Since `t` will start at 1 and go up to 100 (inclusive), the loop will execute as long as the program is in a valid state. 

Thus, all required conditions are satisfied for the for loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 100, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` starts at 1**
