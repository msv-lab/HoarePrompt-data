`current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its previous value. Since `length` is the first element in list `a` and is less than `t - 1` (which means `length` is less than 2), the expression `t - 1 - length` will yield a positive integer. Other variables are not affected, so the Output State reflects the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is updated by adding (t - 1 - length), `length` is the first element in list `a`, and the current value of `length` is less than 2.**
