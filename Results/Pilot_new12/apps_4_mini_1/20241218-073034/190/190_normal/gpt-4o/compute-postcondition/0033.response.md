The operation `current_cost += t - 1 - length` updates the value of `current_cost`. The initial values are `t` equal to 2, `current_cost` equal to 0, and `length` is the first element in the list `a`. Since `length` is less than 1, we can denote it as some positive integer less than 1.

Calculating the new value of `current_cost`:
- Given `t = 2`, the calculation becomes:
  ```
  current_cost += 2 - 1 - length
  current_cost += 1 - length
  ```

Since `length` is a positive integer less than 1, let's denote it as `length < 1`, which means `length` is probably 0 when it refers to a list of positive integers. This eventually results in:
```
current_cost += 1 - 0 
current_cost = 1
```

Thus after executing the code, the output state reflects the change in `current_cost` only.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is 1, `length` is the first element in the list `a` which is less than 1.**
