The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the difference `(t - 1 - length)` to its previous value. Given that `t` is `1` and `length` is less than `t - 1`, which means `length` is less than `0`, the expression simplifies to:

```
current_cost += 0 - length
current_cost += -length
```

Since `length` is a positive integer (as it is an element of list `a`), `-length` will result in a negative value, thus `current_cost` will increase by the absolute value of `length`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but we must note the updated `current_cost` and keep track of pre-existing conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is increased by `-length` where `length` is the first element of list `a` and is less than `0`.**
