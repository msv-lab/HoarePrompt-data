In the given code, `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to it. The variable `t` is currently 3, and `length` is the second element in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` positive integers and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `length` is known to be a positive integer.

1. The expression `t - 1` equals `3 - 1`, which equals `2`.
2. Therefore, `current_cost` is updated by adding `2 - length` to its current value.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. We can express the output state in terms of the specific variables that have changed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 3, `length` is the second element in `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (2 - length)`**.
