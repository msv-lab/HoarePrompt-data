According to the code, the loop's execution is determined by the `t` variable and the range defined in the `for` loop statement. The loop runs from `t = 1` to `t = 100`, which means it will execute while `t` is less than or equal to 100. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 2, indicating that the loop has executed for `t = 1` and `t = 2`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `t` will be incremented by 1. This means `t` will become 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `t` must be less than or equal to 100, which it is, since 3 is less than 100.

Thus, we adjust `t` and acknowledge that `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop. There are no changes to the state of `min_cost`, `best_t`, `n`, or `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, and `t` is 3**
