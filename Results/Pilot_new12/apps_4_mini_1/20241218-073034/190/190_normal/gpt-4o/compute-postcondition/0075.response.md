Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the elements of `a`, which reflects the adjustments made based on each element's comparison to `t - 1` and `t + 1`. `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, and `t` is 3. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
