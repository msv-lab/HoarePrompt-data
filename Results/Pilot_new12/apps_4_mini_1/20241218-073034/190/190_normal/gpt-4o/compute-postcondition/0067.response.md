Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, and `t` is 3. If `length` (which is the second element in `a`) is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (a[1] - 4)` and `length` is set to `a[1]`.***
