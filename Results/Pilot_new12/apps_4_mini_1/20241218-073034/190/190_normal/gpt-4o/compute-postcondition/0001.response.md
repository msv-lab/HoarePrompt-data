The variable `a` is assigned the list of integers created by splitting the user input (which is taken as a space-separated string) and converting each split string into an integer. The variable `n`, which is a positive integer equal to the user input before this code executes, defines how many integers should be present in the list. The value of `a` now becomes a list of integers, which are positive integers ranging from 1 to 100, corresponding to the input. The initial condition about `n` still holds true, but now we also have `a` updated to reflect the values from user input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the user input; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= a[i] <= 100, corresponding to the user input.**
