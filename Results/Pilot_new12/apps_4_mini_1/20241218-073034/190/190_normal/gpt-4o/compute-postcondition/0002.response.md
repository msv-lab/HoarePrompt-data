The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The initial state of the program still holds true, where `n` is a positive integer equal to the user input and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (each between 1 and 100). None of the previous values of `n` or `a` have changed, only the new value of `min_cost` has been introduced.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the user input; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= a[i] <= 100; `min_cost` is float('inf').**
