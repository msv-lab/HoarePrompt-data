Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It computes the minimum cost required to adjust the lengths of the integers in list `a` to be within the range `t - 1` to `t + 1` for some value of `t` between 1 and 100. The function identifies the optimal value of `t` that results in this minimum cost and prints both the optimal `t` and the corresponding minimum cost. It operates under the assumption that `n` is always between 1 and 1000 and each integer in `a` is between 1 and 100. Despite ensuring valid inputs, the function does not handle invalid inputs or erroneous cases, such as non-integer inputs or inputs outside the expected range.**
