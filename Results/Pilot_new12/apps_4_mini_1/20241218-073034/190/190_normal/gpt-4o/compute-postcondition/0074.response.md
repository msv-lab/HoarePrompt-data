Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the elements of `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, and `t` is 3. The loop will execute `n` times if `a` has `n` elements, and thus `current_cost` reflects the adjustments made based on each element's comparison to `t - 1` and `t + 1`. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute and `current_cost` will remain 0.**
