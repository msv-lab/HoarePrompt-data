The variable `current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`. Considering the initial state, the length of `a` is stated to be greater than `t + 1` (which is 2). Therefore, `length` must be at least 3. Since `t` is 1, we can calculate `current_cost` as follows:

- Initially, `current_cost` is 0.
- The new value will be `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`.

Since `length` is at least 3:
1. If `length` is 3: 
   - `current_cost` becomes `0 + (3 - (1 + 1)) = 0 + (3 - 2) = 1`.

2. If `length` is 4: 
   - `current_cost` becomes `0 + (4 - (1 + 1)) = 0 + (4 - 2) = 2`.

3. Higher values for `length` will increase `current_cost` accordingly. For example, if `length` is 5, `current_cost` becomes `3`, etc.

However, since the exact value of `length` is not provided but we know it must be at least 3, the resulting output for `current_cost` should encompass the minimum possible value and indicate the potential for it to increase based on the value of `length`.

Thus, the updated values are:
- `current_cost` will be at least 1 (if `length` is exactly 3).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is at least 1, the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 1, and the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 2).**
