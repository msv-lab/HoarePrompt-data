The code adjusts the `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `(t + 1)`. Given that `t` is `2`, the expression `(t + 1)` evaluates to `3`. Therefore, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)`.

The previous values of the affected variables were:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged
- `t` is 2
- `current_cost` remains unchanged
- `length` is the next element in the list `a`, which must be a positive integer

After executing the code, the updated value of `current_cost` will be `current_cost + (length - 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)`, `length` is the next element in the list `a`, which must be a positive integer.**
