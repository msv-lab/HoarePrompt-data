Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers with at least one more integer remaining, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, and `t` is 2. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated as `current_cost + (1 - length)`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)`. If `length` is not greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
