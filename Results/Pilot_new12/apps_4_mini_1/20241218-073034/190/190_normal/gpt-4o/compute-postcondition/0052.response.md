The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is 2. The value of `best_t` changes, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects this change along with the valid precondition information.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `current_cost` is less than its previous value of `min_cost`.**
