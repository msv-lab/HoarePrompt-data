The operation `current_cost += t - 1 - length` modifies the value of `current_cost`. Given that `t` is 2 and `length` is the next element in the list `a`, we can express the update for `current_cost` as follows:

- The updated value of `current_cost` will be `current_cost + (2 - 1 - length)`, which simplifies to `current_cost + (1 - length)`. 

Since `length` is known to be a positive integer (as it is the next element in the positive integer list `a`), this means that `1 - length` will be either negative or zero, making the overall change in `current_cost` negative or zero.

The values of the other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is reduced by `length - 1`, `length` is the next positive integer in the list `a`.**
