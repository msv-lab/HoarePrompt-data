Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the elements of `a`, `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to be equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 3, and `t` remains 3. If `a` is empty, `current_cost` remains 0 and no changes are made.***
