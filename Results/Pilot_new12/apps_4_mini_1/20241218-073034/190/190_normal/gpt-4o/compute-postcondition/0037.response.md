Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is 2, and if `length` (the first element in the list `a` which is greater than or equal to 1) is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is set to `length - 3` and `length` is greater than 3.***
