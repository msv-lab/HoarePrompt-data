Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 3, and if `length`, the first element in `a`, is less than 2, `current_cost` is updated by adding `(t - 1 - length)`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 4` if `length` is greater than 4.***
