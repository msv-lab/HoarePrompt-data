The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. The initial state mentions that `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, which suggests that after this assignment, `min_cost` will now equal the value of `current_cost`, which is a positive integer and less than its previous value. Other variables, namely `n`, `a`, `best_t`, and `t`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `current_cost` is less than its previous value of `min_cost`.**
