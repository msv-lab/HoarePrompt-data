Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 3, and if `length`, the second element in `a`, is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4.***
