Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, `t` is 2, if the first element in the list `a` (length) is less than 1, `current_cost` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than or equal to 1 and greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `length - 3`, and `length` is greater than 3.***
