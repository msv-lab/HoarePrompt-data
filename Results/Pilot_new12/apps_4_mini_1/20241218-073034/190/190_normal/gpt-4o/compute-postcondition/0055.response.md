The variable `current_cost` is initialized to `0`. The values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the new value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is 0**.
