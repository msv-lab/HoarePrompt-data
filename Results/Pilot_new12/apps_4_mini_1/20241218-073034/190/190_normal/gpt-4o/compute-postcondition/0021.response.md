The value of `current_cost` is incremented by `(length - (t + 1))`. Given that `t` is initialized to `2`, `t + 1` is equal to `3`. Therefore, the update to `current_cost` becomes `current_cost += length - 3`. The values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `length` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, `length` is the next positive integer from `a`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)`**
