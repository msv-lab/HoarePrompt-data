Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is increased by `-length`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 2)`.***
