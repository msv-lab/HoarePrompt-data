Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` remains unchanged, `best_t` is 2, and `t` is 3. If `length`, the second element in `a`, is less than 2, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (2 - length)`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4.***
