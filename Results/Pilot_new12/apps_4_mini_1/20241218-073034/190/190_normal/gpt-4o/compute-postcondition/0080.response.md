The code snippet prints the values of `best_t` and `min_cost`. Therefore, the states of the variables `best_t` and `min_cost` will remain unchanged, but their values will be output to the console. The variables `n` and `a` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated for the optimal adjustment of lengths in `a`, `best_t` is the value of `t` that resulted in that minimum cost, and the values of `best_t` and `min_cost` have been printed.**
