The variable `length` is assigned the next integer in the list `a`. The current_cost is incremented by the value of `length` minus (t + 1). Since `t` is 2, (t + 1) equals 3. Thus, the change in `current_cost` can be expressed as `current_cost += length - 3`. The updated value of `current_cost` reflects this change.

Since the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t`) remain unchanged, the output state will include their original values along with the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers with at least one more integer remaining; `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged; `t` is 2; `length` is the next integer in the list `a`; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - 3)`**
