The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 100, `min_cost` is float('inf'), `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is 0.
