The line of code `min_cost = current_cost` assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. Given the initial state indicates that the `current_cost` is less than `min_cost` (which is currently set to `float('inf')`), after the assignment, `min_cost` will now hold the value of `current_cost`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 <= a[i] <= 100`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and if `n` is 0, then `current_cost` remains 0.**
