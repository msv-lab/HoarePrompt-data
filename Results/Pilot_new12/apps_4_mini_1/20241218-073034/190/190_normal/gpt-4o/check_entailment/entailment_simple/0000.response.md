Correctness: **True**

The provided program adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a complete analysis of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program first reads an integer `n`, which is the number of sticks, and then reads a list of integers `a`, which represents the lengths of the sticks. This corresponds directly with the problem's input specification.

2. **Finding `t` and Minimum Cost**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100. This is correct because `t` must be a positive integer, and the stick lengths are bounded within the range of 1 to 100. Thus, checking `t` in this range is appropriate.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each `t`, the program calculates the `current_cost` needed to adjust each stick length to be "almost good" for that `t` (i.e., within 1 unit of `t`). The conditions `if length < t - 1` and `elif length > t + 1` correctly capture the adjustments required:
     - If `length` is less than `t - 1`, it increases the length to `t - 1`.
     - If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, it decreases the length to `t + 1`.
   - The cost of these operations, which is calculated as the absolute differences, matches the cost definition provided in the problem statement.

4. **Tracking Minimum Cost**:
   - The variables `min_cost` and `best_t` are used to keep track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value. If a new lower cost is found, it updates these variables accordingly.

5. **Output**: 
   - Finally, the program prints the best value of `t` and the minimum cost, conforming to the output requirements.

Since the program successfully computes the required values based on the problem constraints, and it comprehensively evaluates the necessary conditions for all sticks at each potential `t`, it fulfills the problem objectives accurately. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct and meets all specified requirements.
