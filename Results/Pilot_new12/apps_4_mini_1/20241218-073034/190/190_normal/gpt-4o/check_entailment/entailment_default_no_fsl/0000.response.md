Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. It iterates through potential values of `t` from 1 to 100, calculating the cost of adjusting each stick length to make it "almost good" for that `t`. 

1. It maintains a minimum cost variable (`min_cost`) and a best value for `t` (`best_t`).
2. For each stick length, it computes the required adjustments and accumulates the total cost if the length is outside the range of `t - 1` to `t + 1`.
3. It keeps track of the minimum cost and associated `t`, printing the results in the expected format.

The logic ensures that the output meets the criteria specified in the problem description as it correctly chooses the optimal `t` to minimize the adjustment cost. The main functional flow and decisions reflect the requirements to make all stick lengths "almost good."

All test cases described in the problem description and output hints have been handled appropriately in terms of achieving the optimal `t` and calculating the correct minimum cost. Therefore, the program appears to be correct for all valid inputs satisfying the stated constraints.
