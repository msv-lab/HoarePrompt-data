Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents a stick's length in the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is now a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to the sum of `abs(x - mid)` for each stick `x` in `sticks`; `min_t` is equal to `t`; `i` is now `mid - 1`; and `cost` is equal to the sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks). The current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
