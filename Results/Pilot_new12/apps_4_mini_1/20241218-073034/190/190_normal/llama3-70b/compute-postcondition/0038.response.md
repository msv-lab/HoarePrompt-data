Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `i` is `mid + 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum of absolute differences of each stick in `sticks` from `i` and `i - 1`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
