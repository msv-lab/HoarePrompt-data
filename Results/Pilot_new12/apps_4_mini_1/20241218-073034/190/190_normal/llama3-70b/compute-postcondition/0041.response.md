Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `min_cost` is the minimum cost evaluated for stick lengths from `mid + 1` to `100`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to the minimum cost found during the iterations, or remains equal to its initial value if no cost was found to be less than the initial `min_cost`.**
