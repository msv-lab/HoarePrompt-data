The `sticks` list is sorted in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks, and `sticks` is a list of these same integers. Since `sticks` is now sorted, it holds the same elements as before but in a rearranged order. The values of `n`, `a`, and the individual stick lengths remain valid. The exact order of elements in `sticks` is not provided, but it is guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents a stick's length in the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is now a sorted list of the integers in `a`.**
