The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` is derived from the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `i`, and `i + 1`, but its exact previous value is not specified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 2; `i` is `mid - 2`; `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `i` and `i + 1`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
