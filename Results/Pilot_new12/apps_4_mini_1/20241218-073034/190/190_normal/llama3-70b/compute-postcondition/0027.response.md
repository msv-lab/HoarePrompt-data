Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `min_cost` is the calculated minimum cost; `min_t` is equal to `mid` if the loop does not execute; the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
