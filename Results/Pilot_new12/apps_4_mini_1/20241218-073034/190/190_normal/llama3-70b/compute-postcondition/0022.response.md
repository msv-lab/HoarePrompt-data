The statement `min_t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `min_t`. The variables `n`, `a`, `sticks`, `mid`, `cost`, and `min_cost` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. The value of `min_t` now becomes equal to `i` which is `mid - 3`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 2; `i` is `mid - 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `i` and `i + 1`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `i` (which is `mid - 3`).**
