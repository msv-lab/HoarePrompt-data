The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` is the sum of the minimum of absolute differences computed with respect to `sticks`, but the specific value of `cost` was not provided. Therefore, we retain the uncertainty regarding its exact value while stating that `min_cost` now equals `cost`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `i` is `mid + 2`; `cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum of absolute differences computed with respect to `sticks`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
