According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition it needs to satisfy within the loop against 101. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `mid`, since the loop starts iterating from `mid + 1` up to 100. 

To execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and should be less than or equal to 100. Thus, if `i` is at `mid + 1` at the end of the last iteration, it is necessary to ensure that `i` becomes `mid + 2` for the next iteration. It must also be checked if `mid` is less than or equal to 99, allowing `i` to reach a maximum of 100.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; i is `mid + 2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to 100.**
