Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents a stick's length in the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is now a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]`; `cost` is the sum of `abs(x - mid)` for each stick `x` in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
