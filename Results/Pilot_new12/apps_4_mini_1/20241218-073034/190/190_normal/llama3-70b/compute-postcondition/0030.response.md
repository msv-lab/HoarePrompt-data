Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; if `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to the value of `cost`, and `min_t` is set to `i`; otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
