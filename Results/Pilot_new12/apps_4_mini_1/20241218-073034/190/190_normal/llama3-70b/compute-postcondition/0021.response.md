The variable `min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The previous conditions specify that `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in the `sticks` list and `i` and `i + 1`, where `i` is currently set to `mid - 3`. Since there are no changes to other variables, they remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 2; `i` is `mid - 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `i` and `i + 1`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
