Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`, and `mid` is at least 2. If the current value of `cost` is less than the previous value of `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to the value of `cost`, `min_t` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `i` is now set to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.***
