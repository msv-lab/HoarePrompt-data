The value of `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous state mentions that `min_t` is equal to `mid` if the loop does not execute, but after the assignment, `min_t` now takes the value of `i`. The value of `i` is currently not specified in the initial conditions, so we just make note of this assignment without fully determining the previous value of `min_t`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `i`; the current value of `cost` is less than the new `min_cost`. `min_t` is now equal to `i`.**
