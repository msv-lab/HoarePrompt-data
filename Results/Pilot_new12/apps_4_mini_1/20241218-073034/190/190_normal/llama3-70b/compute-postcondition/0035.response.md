Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `i` is `mid + 2`; `cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum of absolute differences computed with respect to `sticks`; if `cost < min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `i`.*
