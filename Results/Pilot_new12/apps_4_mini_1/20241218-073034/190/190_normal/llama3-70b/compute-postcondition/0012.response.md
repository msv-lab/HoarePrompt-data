The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `mid - 1`. Since the initial state indicates that `i` is `mid - 1`, the value of `min_t` will also now be `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values as stated.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents a stick's length in the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is now a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to the current value of `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`; `i` is now `mid - 1`; `cost` is the sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks), and the current value of `cost` is less than the previous value of `min_cost`.**
