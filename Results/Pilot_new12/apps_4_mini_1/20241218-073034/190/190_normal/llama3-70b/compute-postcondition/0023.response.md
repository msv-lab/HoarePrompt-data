Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 2; `i` is `mid - 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in `sticks` and `i` and `i + 1`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is updated to `i`.***
