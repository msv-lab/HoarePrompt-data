To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop condition.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is `mid + 2`, which implies the value of `i` is greater than `mid + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 101.

Given that `mid` is at most 99, we can analyze the values:
- Since `i` is currently `mid + 2`, its value can range from `2` (when `mid` is `0`) to `101` (when `mid` is `99`).
  
For the loop to execute again:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 during the next iteration, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- Therefore, it needs to stay less than 101, which means `i + 1` must be less than or equal to 100.

### Conclusion:
The current value of `i` when exiting the previous iteration is `mid + 2`. In order for the loop to run again, `i` must become `mid + 3`. For this to be valid, `mid` must be at least 98 (because `mid + 3` must be less than 101).

Thus:
- For the next iteration of the loop, we need `i` to be `mid + 3` and ensure it meets the loop's condition: `i` must be less than 101. This still holds true as long as `mid` is at most 99.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `i` is `mid + 3`; `cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum of absolute differences computed with respect to `sticks`.**
