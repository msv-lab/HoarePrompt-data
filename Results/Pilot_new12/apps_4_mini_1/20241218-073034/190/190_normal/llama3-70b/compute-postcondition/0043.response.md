The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\). Parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents a stick's length and satisfies \(1 \leq a[i] \leq 100\). The functionality of the function is to process the list of stick lengths and return a result based on specific conditions applied to the lengths of the sticks. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers representing stick lengths, then processes these lengths to return a result based on specified conditions.**
