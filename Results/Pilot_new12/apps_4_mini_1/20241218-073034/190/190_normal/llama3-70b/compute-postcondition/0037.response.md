To compute the value of `cost`, we first evaluate the expression given in the code snippet: 

`cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)`

This expression calculates the total cost based on the lengths of the sticks and their proximity to the value of `i` and `i-1`. 

1. The variable `sticks` represents a sorted list of integers based on stick lengths from the list `a`, therefore `x` assumes each value in `sticks`.
2. Since `i` is defined as `mid + 3`, where `mid` is at most 99, `i` can be at most 102.
3. `cost` is computed by iterating through each stick length `x` in the sorted list `sticks`. For each stick, we calculate the minimum of the absolute differences to `i` and `i-1`, and sum all these minimum values.

This results in a numerical value for `cost` that reflects how well the sticks align with the range defined by `i` and `i-1`.

Since the exact values of `sticks`, `i`, and the resultant `cost` cannot be determined without specific values of the input list `a`, I will state the output reflecting the computed cost.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `i` is `mid + 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum of absolute differences of each stick in `sticks` from `i` and `i - 1`.**
