The code assigns a list of integers to the variable `sticks` by taking space-separated input from the user, mapping each input string to an integer. The variable `n` defines the number of integers in the list, and `a` represents the lengths of the sticks within the specified limits.

Since `sticks` is derived from the input and corresponds to `a`, it will contain `n` integers that are all within the range of 1 to 100. The values of `n` and `a` do not change, but the variable `sticks` will take the new list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents a stick's length in the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers mapped from input.**
