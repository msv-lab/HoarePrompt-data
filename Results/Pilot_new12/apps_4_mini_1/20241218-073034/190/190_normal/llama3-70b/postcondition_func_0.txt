The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths, sorts the lengths, and then calculates the minimum cost of adjusting stick lengths to a target length. It first considers the median of the stick lengths and then iteratively checks target lengths below and above this median (from `mid - 1` to `1` and from `mid + 1` to `100`) to find the target length `min_t` with the minimum cost. The final output includes `min_t` and the associated `min_cost`, which represents the least total effort required to adjust the sticks to a uniform length. It also handles edge cases for the output when there are no lengths below 1 or above 100. The function does not have any handling for when `n` is 0 or when input values are out of the specified bounds (though constraints are stated), but it assumes valid input as per the usage context.
