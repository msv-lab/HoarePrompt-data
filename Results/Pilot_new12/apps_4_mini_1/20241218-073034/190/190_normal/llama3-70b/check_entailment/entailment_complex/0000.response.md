Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it fulfills all specified conditions:

1. **Input Handling**: It correctly reads an integer `n` representing the number of stick lengths and a list of `n` integers that represent the lengths. The constraints state that these lengths will be in the range of 1 to 100, which the program assumes holds true for valid inputs.

2. **Median Calculation**: The program computes the median stick length (`mid`) which serves as a reasonable starting point for minimizing cost since adjusting to a median can often minimize the total distance in absolute value terms.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the total cost of modifications needed to make all stick lengths almost good for a target length `t`. It checks both below and above the median value by iterating from `mid - 1` down to `1` and then from `mid + 1` up to `100`. This ensures that it evaluates all possible target values of `t` that might provide a minimal modification cost.

4. **Iterative Optimization**: In each iteration, the program computes the cost of altering stick lengths to align with the current target `i` and keeps track of the minimum cost found and its corresponding target length. This exhaustive search over the range of possible values of `t` ensures that the solution is optimal, complying with the requirement of minimizing the total modification cost effectively.

5. **Output Formatting**: Finally, the program outputs the optimal length `min_t` with the associated minimum cost `min_cost` in the required format.

6. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles the edge cases correctly as it ensures the value for `t` will always fall within valid bounds given the constraints of stick lengths.

Since the function performs all required checks and balances to meet the task described in the problem statement while ensuring efficiency and correctness, it is indeed a correct implementation. Therefore, we conclude that the program is correct as it adheres to the problem description requirements.
