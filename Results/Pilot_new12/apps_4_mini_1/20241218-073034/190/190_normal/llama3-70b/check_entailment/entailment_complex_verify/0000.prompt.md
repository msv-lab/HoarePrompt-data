You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the given Python program and verify its correctness according to the provided problem description, let's break down the key requirements and what the function is doing:

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have an array of stick lengths.
2. We can change the length of each stick to any positive integer to minimize the cost of changes.
3. A stick length is considered almost good for an integer \( t \) if \( |a_i - t| \leq 1 \).
4. We need to find a \( t \) such that all sticks are almost good for \( t \), and the total cost of changes is minimized.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. The program sorts the stick lengths and calculates the median stick length as a potential \( t \).
2. It initializes `min_cost` with the cost of making all sticks equal to `t` (the median).
3. It then checks values below and above the median stick length to find a corresponding \( t \) that minimizes the change cost.
4. The program prints the optimal \( t \) and its associated minimum cost.

### Flaw in Logic:
To check for correctness, let's test a specific case:

#### Case:
Input:
```
5
1 3 5 7 9
```

Expected behavior:
1. If we try to set all sticks to be almost good for \( t = 6 \), we would have:
   - Change 1 to 4 (cost = 3)
   - Change 3 to 5 (cost = 2)
   - 5 is already good (cost = 0)
   - Change 7 to 6 (cost = 1)
   - Change 9 to 8 (cost = 1)

   Total Cost = 3 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 7. 

2. The program should then also check `t = 5`:
   - Change 1 to 4 (cost = 3)
   - Change 3 to 4 (cost = 1)
   - 5 is already good (cost = 0)
   - Change 7 to 5 (cost = 2)
   - Change 9 to 8 (cost = 1)

   Total Cost = 3 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 7.

In this example, while the median may lead to an optimal or near-optimal solution, it doesn't account for ensuring all values around the bounds (the extremes of lengths) adequately since the range of lengths from `[1, 9]` offers a higher cost when we move out of certain boundaries.

### Conclusion:
There could be many potential values of \( t \) that are optimal, and there could be instances where their costs are not being evaluated correctly due to how increments for both ends are performed. Specifically, the way `mid` is defined assumes it will always be the best choice when it may not hold in every possible distribution of lengths.

Based on our findings, we can determine the correctness:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and a is a list of n integers where each integer represents a stick's length and satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 1; `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated based on the evaluated values of `i` from `mid - 1` down to `1`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to `min_cost` if the loop executed; if the loop did not execute, `min_t` remains equal to the initial value of `mid`.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `min_cost` is the minimum cost evaluated for stick lengths from `mid + 1` to `100`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to the minimum cost found during the iterations, or remains equal to its initial value if no cost was found to be less than the initial `min_cost`.
    print(min_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths, sorts the lengths, and then calculates the minimum cost of adjusting stick lengths to a target length. It first considers the median of the stick lengths and then iteratively checks target lengths below and above this median (from `mid - 1` to `1` and from `mid + 1` to `100`) to find the target length `min_t` with the minimum cost. The final output includes `min_t` and the associated `min_cost`, which represents the least total effort required to adjust the sticks to a uniform length. It also handles edge cases for the output when there are no lengths below 1 or above 100. The function does not have any handling for when `n` is 0 or when input values are out of the specified bounds (though constraints are stated), but it assumes valid input as per the usage context.
