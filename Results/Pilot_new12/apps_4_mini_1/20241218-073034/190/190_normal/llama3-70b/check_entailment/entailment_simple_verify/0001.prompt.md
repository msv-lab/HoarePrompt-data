You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the cases where the optimal values of `t` may lead to different total costs when adjusting stick lengths.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 7 8
```

In this scenario, the optimal integer `t` should be `3`, which allows the lengths to be adjusted to `[2, 3, 3, 3, 3]` at a total cost of `1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 10`. However, the program does not account for this optimal configuration because it primarily focuses on a single median element and its closest adjustments rather than examining ties or better combinations over the range of possible `t` values.

The implementation calculates costs based on an initial choice of `mid` and then only adjusts around `mid`, which could easily miss discovering lower total costs achievable at other `t` values, particularly in cases where stick lengths are clustered together with outliers on either side.

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not ensure finding the minimum possible cost for every valid potential `t`, leading to the conclusion that it does not adhere to the problem's requirements in every case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and a is a list of n integers where each integer represents a stick's length and satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at least 1; `min_cost` is the minimum cost calculated based on the evaluated values of `i` from `mid - 1` down to `1`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to `min_cost` if the loop executed; if the loop did not execute, `min_t` remains equal to the initial value of `mid`.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths within the range 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of the integers in `a`; `mid` is at most 99; `min_cost` is the minimum cost evaluated for stick lengths from `mid + 1` to `100`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that corresponds to the minimum cost found during the iterations, or remains equal to its initial value if no cost was found to be less than the initial `min_cost`.
    print(min_t, min_cost)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
