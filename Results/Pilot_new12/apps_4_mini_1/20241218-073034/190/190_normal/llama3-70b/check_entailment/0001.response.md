Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the cases where the optimal values of `t` may lead to different total costs when adjusting stick lengths.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 7 8
```

In this scenario, the optimal integer `t` should be `3`, which allows the lengths to be adjusted to `[2, 3, 3, 3, 3]` at a total cost of `1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 10`. However, the program does not account for this optimal configuration because it primarily focuses on a single median element and its closest adjustments rather than examining ties or better combinations over the range of possible `t` values.

The implementation calculates costs based on an initial choice of `mid` and then only adjusts around `mid`, which could easily miss discovering lower total costs achievable at other `t` values, particularly in cases where stick lengths are clustered together with outliers on either side.

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not ensure finding the minimum possible cost for every valid potential `t`, leading to the conclusion that it does not adhere to the problem's requirements in every case.
