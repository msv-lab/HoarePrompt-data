Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the lengths of the sticks could be outside the range of 1 to 100 as stated in the problem description. Although the constraints are assured (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), the program erroneously assumes values below 1 and above 100 can be adjusted, leading to an unnecessary loop from mid - 1 to 0 and mid + 1 to 101 which violates the expected behavior. For example, if input included a stick of length 0 or above 100, it could lead to incorrect calculations. 

Also, the logic of calculating costs using absolute differences could fail in multiple cases as it does not explicitly ensure that all adjustments lead to lengths that are "almost good" for some integer `t`. It focuses on minimizing costs without guaranteeing that the final stick lengths will be almost good for the chosen `t`. Therefore, the algorithm might fail to correctly produce a valid solution for some inputs like those that would require adjustments to stick lengths exceeding the preset bounds. 

In conclusion, there are multiple scenarios where the output could be invalid, such as having stick lengths that would breach the required conditions. Thus, the overall functionality does not satisfy the problem description fully, leading to the assessment of incorrectness.
