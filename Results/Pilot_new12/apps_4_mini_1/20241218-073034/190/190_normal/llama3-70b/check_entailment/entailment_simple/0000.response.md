The provided program aims to determine a positive integer `t` such that all stick lengths are "almost good" for that integer, while also achieving the minimum total adjustment cost to satisfy this condition. Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

### Key Elements of the Problem Description:

1. **Almost Good Definition**: 
   A stick length \(a_i\) is considered almost good for some integer \(t\) if \(|a_i - t| \leq 1\). This means that \(t\) should ideally be close to the values of the stick lengths.

2. **Cost of Changing Lengths**: 
   The required cost to change a stickâ€™s length from \(a\) to \(b\) is given by \(|a - b|\). The total cost for all sticks must be minimized.

3. **Output Requirements**: 
   The function must return the value of \(t\) and the corresponding minimum cost.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Finding `mid`**: 
   - The program calculates `mid` as the median stick length. This is a reasonable starting point since the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

2. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - The program then calculates the cost for all values from \(mid - 1\) to 1 and from \(mid + 1\) to 100.
   - During each consideration of a possible value of \(t\) (represented as \(i\)), it computes the cost based on the closest values \(i\) or \(i+1\) for adjustment. This is consistent with the requirement to check for "almost good" conditions.

3. **Tracking Minimum Cost**: 
   - The program maintains `min_cost` and `min_t`, updating them whenever a lower cost is found during the evaluations.

4. **Output**: 
   - It correctly prints the best \(t\) and the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

The program implements a systematic approach to finding the optimal integer \(t\) that minimizes the cost to make all stick lengths "almost good". It adheres to guidelines of considering costs for both potential integer candidates (one less and one more than the current bound) during its calculations. It also correctly analyzes all possible effective values of \(t\).

### Final Verdict:
The program is correct. It meets all the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
