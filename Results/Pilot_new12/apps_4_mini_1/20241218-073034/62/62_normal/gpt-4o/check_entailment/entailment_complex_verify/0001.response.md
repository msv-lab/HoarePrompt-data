In reviewing the original assessment and the annotated version of the program, it is clear that the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description effectively. 

1. The program reads the inputs as specified, capturing the number of digits and their respective bases correctly within the defined range.
2. It processes the lists of digits and employs the function `func_1` to convert these digits from their respective bases into their decimal equivalents.
3. The comparison of the two decimal values is straightforward and yields the correct relational output ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

The annotation indicates that the function `func_1` computes the decimal representation correctly, even though it lacks input validation for the ranges of the digits. However, the constraints provided in the problem description state that the digits will always be in the valid range (0 to base-1), so this lack of validation will not affect the program's operation under typical scenarios described.

Furthermore, the assertion made in the annotations regarding the function returning 0 for an empty list of digits could be seen as more of a theoretical concern in practice since the input constraints ensure that there will always be at least one digit (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10).

Given these points, the original assessment declaring the program as correct is justified, as the program will function as intended under the established constraints. Therefore, incorporating the reasoning based on the annotations and the absence of edge cases for this specific problem, I find no need to change the original assessment.

Final: **True**
