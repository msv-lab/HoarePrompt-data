Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly follow the specifications outlined in the problem description. The code does the following:

1. Reads the number of digits and base for both numbers X and Y.
2. Reads the digits of the numbers as lists.
3. Converts both numbers from their respective bases to decimal values using the function `func_1`, which correctly performs the conversion.
4. Finally, it compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ('<', '>', or '=').

The conversion logic in `func_1` correctly aggregates the digit values based on their respective bases. The program correctly handles the constraints provided (like no leading zeros and all digits being within the appropriate limits) as specified in the problem description.

As I cannot find any edge cases where the program fails or doesn't meet the problem requirements, I conclude that it works correctly for all potential cases defined by the problem description.
