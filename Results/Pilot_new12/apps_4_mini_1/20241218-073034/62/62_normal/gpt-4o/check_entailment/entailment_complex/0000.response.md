Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why it is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes input in the defined format, first parsing the values for the number of digits and their respective bases for both numbers X and Y.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits from a specified base to its decimal representation. It does this by iterating through each digit, which is essential for the correct accumulation of the decimal value as per the base. The logic of multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the next digit is consistent with the way positional number systems work.

3. **Comparison Logic**: The program compares the two decimal representations obtained from the function calls. It uses relational operators to determine if X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y, conforming to the expected output format.

4. **Output Formatting**: The output is printed using the specified characters ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison, which aligns with the requirements stated.

5. **Assumed Validity of Input**: Based on the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid. The program is designed with the understanding that both X and Y will be positive integers with allowable digits corresponding to their bases. 

By meeting all these criteria, the program adheres closely to the problem description and is therefore correct.
