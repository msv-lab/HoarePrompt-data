Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described. Although it correctly converts digits from their respective bases to decimal and compares the results for valid inputs, it lacks input validation for the digits. Specifically, it should check that each digit provided is less than the base and greater than or equal to zero. 

For instance, if the digits for either X or Y include invalid digits (such as negative numbers or numbers equal to or greater than the base), the program does not have any mechanism to catch this error, which could lead to incorrect comparisons or unintended results. Without proper validation, there's no guarantee that the conversion to decimal would be accurate in all scenarios.

Additionally, the output hints mention that if `func_1` receives an empty list, it would return 0, which does not align with the problem statement, since both X and Y should be positive integers represented by their digits. However, the problem description ensures there will be no leading zeroes and both numbers are positive, but it does not explicitly state that an empty list of digits cannot be input, which leaves ambiguity. This could also lead to an unexpected result.

Therefore, due to the lack of digit validation and potential for incorrect input handling, the program does not meet the necessary correctness criteria.
