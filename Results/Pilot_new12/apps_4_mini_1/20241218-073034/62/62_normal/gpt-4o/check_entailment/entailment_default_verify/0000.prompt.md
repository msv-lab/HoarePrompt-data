You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output
=

Input
3 3
1 0 2
2 5
2 4

Output
<

Input
7 16
15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    return decimal_value


```
Original Assessment: The provided program aims to compare two numbers given in different bases by converting them to decimal (base 10) and then comparing the resulting integers. Let's analyze it based on the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Potential Edge Cases and Considerations:
1. **Different Lengths:** The numbers can have different lengths when represented in their respective bases. The program handles this correctly by converting both numbers to decimal.
2. **Base Constraints:** The bases must differ, which is ensured by the problem statement, and the program does not violate this constraint.
3. **Range of Digits:** The digits given for each number must not exceed the base they're represented in (e.g., for base 3, valid digits are 0, 1, and 2). The program does not perform validation for this.
4. **Leading Zeros:** The specification notes both numbers are positive and have no leading zeros. This is reflected correctly in the handling of input.

### Missing Logic:
The function does not check if the digits conform to the respective bases:

- **Example of Invalid Input:**
  If we input a number `X` in base `b_x` where any digit is greater than or equal to `b_x`, the input should be considered invalid, and the function should ideally raise an error (or handle it in some way). For instance:
  - Input:
    ```
    3 5
    1 2 5
    2 6
    1 4
    ```
  - In this case, the digit `5` in the first number is invalid for base `5`.

The current program does not handle this edge case, so it can lead to incorrect behavior (i.e., it might not raise an error and provide a comparison that wouldn't make sense given the original problem constraints).

### Conclusion:
Due to the lack of validation for the digits being within their respective bases, it is possible for the program to produce misleading results or errors in cases where the input is invalid. Therefore, the program does not meet all requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `digits`, each representing a digit in a given base `base` (ranging from 2 to 40), and computes its decimal equivalent. It iterates through the `digits`, updating a variable `decimal_value` to accumulate the total value as it processes each digit. The final return value is the computed decimal representation of the number represented by the provided digits in the specified base. However, the function lacks validation for the input `digits`, which should be checked to ensure that each digit is within the valid range for the specified base (0 to base-1). Additionally, there is no handling for cases where the input `digits` list is empty, which could lead to an unintended output of 0 in such scenarios. The function, as implemented, will return 0 if given an empty list of digits.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
