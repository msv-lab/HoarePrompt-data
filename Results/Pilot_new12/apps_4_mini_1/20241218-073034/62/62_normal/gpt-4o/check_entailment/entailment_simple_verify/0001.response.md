Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirements as outlined in the problem description, successfully converting numbers from their respective bases to decimal format using the `func_1`, and accurately comparing the two resulting decimal values to output the appropriate comparison symbol ('<', '>', or '=').

The annotations provide a clear understanding of the state of the program at different execution points, confirming that the algorithm operates within the specified constraints and handles valid inputs correctly. The program's logic adheres to the assumption of valid input data, reinforcing the conclusion that the functionality meets the problem's criteria.

Overall, there are no indications of flaws in the logic or handling of the inputs based on the provided annotations. Thus, the program is indeed correct, leading to the final conclusion.
