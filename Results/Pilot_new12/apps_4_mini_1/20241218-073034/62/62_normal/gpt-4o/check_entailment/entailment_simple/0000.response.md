To determine if the provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, we need to analyze its functionality step by step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the first line to get `n` and `b_x` and reads the digits of `X`. It also reads the second set of inputs to get `m` and `b_y` and the digits for `Y`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: 
   - The program uses a function (`func_1`) to convert the lists of digits from their respective bases to decimal format. This function calculates the decimal value of a number based on its digits and base correctly via the formula `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit`.
   - This matches the requirement of converting digits from the specified base to a decimal representation.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After converting both numbers to their decimal values, the program uses standard comparison operators to determine if `X` is less than, greater than, or equal to `Y`, printing the appropriate character (`<`, `>`, or `=`) based on the results.
   - The output matches the required format specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows the problem description. It effectively reads the inputs, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, and then compares those decimal values as required.

Thus, the program behaves correctly for all specified scenarios according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
