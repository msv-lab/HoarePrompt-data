The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `digits`, each representing a digit in a given base `base` (ranging from 2 to 40), and computes its decimal equivalent. It iterates through the `digits`, updating a variable `decimal_value` to accumulate the total value as it processes each digit. The final return value is the computed decimal representation of the number represented by the provided digits in the specified base. However, the function lacks validation for the input `digits`, which should be checked to ensure that each digit is within the valid range for the specified base (0 to base-1). Additionally, there is no handling for cases where the input `digits` list is empty, which could lead to an unintended output of 0 in such scenarios. The function, as implemented, will return 0 if given an empty list of digits.
