The variable `decimal_value` is initialized to `0`. The states of the other variables (i.e., `digits` and `base`) are not modified by this assignment, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `decimal_value` is now `0`, while the initial conditions of `digits` and `base` remain valid.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in the specified base; `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40; `decimal_value` is 0.**
