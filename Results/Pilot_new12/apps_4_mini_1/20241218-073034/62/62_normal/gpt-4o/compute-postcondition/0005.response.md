According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute again for the next integer. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` list must have at least 3 integers, and the next `digit` must be the third integer in the list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base + 1)` where digit is the third integer in the list**
