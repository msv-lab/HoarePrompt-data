The variable `decimal_value` is updated by multiplying its current value by `base` and adding `digit` to it. Given that `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, we can substitute this into the expression. 

Let:
- `digit` = second integer in `digits`
- `decimal_value` was equal to this `digit` before the code runs.

After the execution of the code:

1. The new value of `decimal_value` will be `digit * base + digit`, which can be simplified as `digit * (base + 1)`.
2. The states of the variables `digits` and `base` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * (base + 1)`**.
