According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. At the start, `decimal_value` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, the state of `digits` must be considered for the loop to run.

For the loop to be executed, `digits` must contain at least 1 integer, and `digit` will take the value of the first integer from the list during the first iteration.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is 0, `digit` is the first integer in the list**
