According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute one more time for the next integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 1 integer, and `digit` remains unchanged. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the list has at least 2 integers, and since `digit` must represent the next integer in the list, we should specify that `digit` is the second integer in `digits`.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, and `digit` is the second integer in `digits`**
