Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly follows the problem description by reading input values formatted as specified, converting them from their respective bases to decimal (base 10), and then performing a comparison between the two numbers. The helper function `func_1` effectively transforms the base-represented digits into their decimal equivalent according to the base.

The annotations confirm that the program maintains valid assumptions about the input, particularly that the digit values fall within the expected ranges and the bases adhere to the specified limits. The program is designed to function correctly within these constraints, as established by the problem description. 

Although the annotations note potential issues related to input validity (such as handling invalid digits), the assumption is that valid input is provided. Given that the program is functioning as intended under those assumptions and all provided examples yield expected results, the overall correctness of the program is upheld. Thus, the final assessment remains as **True**.
