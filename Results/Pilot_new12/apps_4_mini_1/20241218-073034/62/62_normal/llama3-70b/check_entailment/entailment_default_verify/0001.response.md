Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct based on its ability to convert numbers from different bases and compare them. However, the output hints point out a critical flaw in the function `func_1`, which does not verify the validity of the digits in relation to the specified base. Specifically, while the program assumes that all digits fall within the valid range (0 to base-1), it does not have any checks in place to enforce this. 

This could lead to incorrect results if invalid digits are inadvertently provided as input, violating the requirements of the problem description. Although the program might work correctly with the valid input provided in the problem scenario, the assumptions made about the input could lead to failure in handling edge cases where invalid digits are present. Therefore, this realization contradicts the original assessment of the program's correctness. Given this oversight regarding input validation, the final correctness of the program must be assessed as false.
