Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the required algorithm to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It effectively converts each number from its respective base to a decimal integer using the function `func_1`, which handles the conversion correctly by iterating through the list of digits and applying the appropriate mathematical transformation.

Let's outline the operation of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values correctly, capturing the number of digits and their respective bases for both numbers X and Y.
2. **Conversion Logic**: The conversion function `func_1` multiplies the current result by the base and adds the next digit, which replicates the process of calculating the decimal value from a base-n number.
3. **Comparison Logic**: After both numbers have been converted into decimal form, the program compares these values and prints the appropriate relational operator ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison results.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40), and the fact that there are no leading zeros and both numbers are positive, all potential edge cases related to the problem description have been considered, and I could not identify any input scenario where the program would fail.

Thus, the program is correct, as it behaves as expected for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
