Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the possibility of invalid digits in the input. According to the problem description, each digit in the representation of numbers X and Y should be within the range of valid digits for their respective bases (i.e., each digit must be between 0 and base-1). 

However, the function `func_1` does not include checks to ensure that all digits passed to it meet this requirement. For example, if the input contains a digit that is equal to or greater than the specified base, the function would still process it without any error, potentially leading to incorrect results. 

Consider the following edge case as an example:

Input:
```
3 5
3 4 0
2 6
2 5
```

Here, the first number `X` has a digit `4`, which is invalid for base `5` (valid digits should be within the range `0` to `4`). The program would incorrectly compute a value based on this invalid digit and return an erroneous comparison, leading to an unexpected result.

Thus, the absence of validation for digit values in `func_1` leads to scenarios where the program could produce incorrect results, hence it does not meet the correctness criteria for every potential case.
