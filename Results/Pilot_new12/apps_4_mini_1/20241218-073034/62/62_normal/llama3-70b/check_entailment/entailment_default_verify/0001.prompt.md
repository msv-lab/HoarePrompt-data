You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input

1 0 1 1 1 1

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the required algorithm to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It effectively converts each number from its respective base to a decimal integer using the function `func_1`, which handles the conversion correctly by iterating through the list of digits and applying the appropriate mathematical transformation.

Let's outline the operation of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values correctly, capturing the number of digits and their respective bases for both numbers X and Y.
2. **Conversion Logic**: The conversion function `func_1` multiplies the current result by the base and adds the next digit, which replicates the process of calculating the decimal value from a base-n number.
3. **Comparison Logic**: After both numbers have been converted into decimal form, the program compares these values and prints the appropriate relational operator ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison results.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40), and the fact that there are no leading zeros and both numbers are positive, all potential edge cases related to the problem description have been considered, and I could not identify any input scenario where the program would fail.

Thus, the program is correct, as it behaves as expected for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, representing the digits of a number in a specified `base`, and an integer `base` (ranging between 2 and 40 inclusive). It computes and returns the numeric value represented by the digits in the given base. If the `digits` list is empty, the function correctly returns 0. However, the function does not include any checks for the validity of the elements within the `digits` list, meaning it assumes all digits are valid for the specified base (i.e., each digit should be in the range 0 to base-1), which could lead to incorrect results or undesired behavior if invalid digits are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
