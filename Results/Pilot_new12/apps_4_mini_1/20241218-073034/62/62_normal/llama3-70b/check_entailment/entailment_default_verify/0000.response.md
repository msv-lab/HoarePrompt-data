Final: **False**

Although the original assessment claims that the program is correct, the output hints reveal a significant oversight regarding input validation. Specifically, the `func_1` function assumes that all digits within the `digits` list are valid for the specified base without conducting any checks. This could lead to incorrect behavior if invalid digits are provided (i.e., digits outside the range of 0 to base-1). Consequently, the program does not adequately ensure the correctness of its operation for all possible inputs within the problem's constraints. Therefore, the assessment of correctness should be revised to indicate that the program cannot be fully trusted to handle all scenarios, particularly in terms of input integrity.
