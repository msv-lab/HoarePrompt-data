Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly implements the procedure for comparing two numbers represented in different bases. The program reads the input format as specified, converts the digits of both numbers from their respective bases to decimal (base 10) using the helper function `func_1`, and then compares the converted values. 

The helper function `func_1` computes the decimal value of a number based on its digit representation and base efficiently and accurately, handling the range of bases as stipulated in the problem description (2 to 40). 

Since all provided examples can be executed and yield the correct outputs according to the problem specification, there doesn't appear to be any edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.
