Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the requirements set out in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it always behaves as expected:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers representing the number of digits and the base for each number X and Y, as required by the problem description. It then reads the respective digit lists for both numbers.

2. **Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to convert a number represented by its digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. It uses the formula:
   \[
   result = result \times \text{base} + \text{digit}
   \]
   This accurately computes the decimal value based on positional representation of numbers in a specific base.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers X and Y to their decimal equivalents, the program correctly compares them using standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, and `=`). It prints the appropriate symbol (`<`, `>`, or `=`) based on the outcome of the comparison.

4. **Handling Different Bases**: The program effectively supports comparisons between numbers of different bases as required by the problem description. It also directly adheres to the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10; 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40; and b_x ≠ b_y), simplifying the verification of numeric conversions.

5. **No Leading Zeroes**: As stated in the problem, since there are no leading zeroes in the input numbers (and it is guaranteed that the input will be valid), the program handles the conversion accurately and without errors.

Given these points, the program meets the problem's requirements for all potential valid inputs as described. Therefore, the answer is correct. 

In summary, the robustness of the base conversion logic, input handling, and comparison processes ensures that the program adheres to the problem description effectively.
