The variable `result` is updated to be equal to `result * base + digit`. The initial state indicates that `result` equals the second digit in the `digits` list, which falls within the specified range. The computation therefore leads to a new value for `result`, while the `digits` list and `base` remain unchanged.

Let:
- `result` = `digits[1]`
- `digit` = some specific value which we can denote as `digits[n]` where `n` is the index of the current digit under consideration.

Thus, the new value of `result` will be `digits[1] * base + digits[n]`. 

The output state will reflect the updated value of `result` while keeping the underlying conditions of `digits` and `base`. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and each digit must be in the range 0 to `base - 1`; `result` is now equal to `digits[1] * base + digit`.**
