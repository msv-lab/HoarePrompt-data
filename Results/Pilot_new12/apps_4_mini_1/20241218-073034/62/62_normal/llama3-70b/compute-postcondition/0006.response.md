In the provided code snippet, `result` is updated by multiplying its current value by `base` and then adding `digit`. The initial state specifies that `result` is currently equal to the expression `digits[1] * base + digits[2]`. 

After executing the code:
1. The value of `result` will be modified based on the formula `result = result * base + digit`.
2. The previous value of `result` before the operation is equal to `digits[1] * base + digits[2]`. 

Now we can substitute this into our formula for the new value of `result`:
- New `result` = `(digits[1] * base + digits[2]) * base + digit`
- This can be simplified to `result = digits[1] * base^2 + digits[2] * base + digit`.

Since only the variable `result` is affected, the output state will reflect its updated value while keeping all other variables' states unchanged.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and each digit must be in the range 0 to `base - 1`; `result` is equal to `digits[1] * base^2 + digits[2] * base + digit`.**
