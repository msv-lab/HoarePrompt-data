To determine the output state based on the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved.

The initial state specifies:

- `digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and each digit must be in the range 0 to `base - 1`.
- `result` is initialized to 0.

The code snippet provided is:

```
result = result * base + digit
```

In this line of code, `result` is updated based on its previous value, `base`, and a specific `digit`. 

Since `result` is initially 0, we can simplify the execution of the code:

1. The previous value of `result` is 0.
2. The expression `result * base` will be `0 * base`, which equals 0.
3. Consequently, the new value assigned to `result` is `0 + digit`, which simplifies to just the value of `digit`.

Given that `digit` must be an integer from the `digits` list (and is in the valid range), the updated value of `result` will be equal to `digit`.

The overall impact indicates that only the `result` variable changes, while the conditions on `digits` remain valid as they are not modified by the code.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and each digit must be in the range 0 to `base - 1`; `result` is equal to `digit`.**
