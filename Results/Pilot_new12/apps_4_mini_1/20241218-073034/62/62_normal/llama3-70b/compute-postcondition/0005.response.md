According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 elements, and the `result` is computed based on the second digit in the list (`digits[1]`) multiplied by `base`, plus the current `digit`. Thus, if the loop is going to execute one more time, it will iterate over the third element in the `digits` list.

We need to check what should happen to the `digit` variable and ensure that the `digits` list continues to satisfy the required conditions. Since `digit` was the second element previously, it must now be the third element for the loop to execute again. According to the conditions, `digits` must still have at least 3 elements, and the new `digit` must also be in the range from 0 to `base - 1`.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and each digit must be in the range 0 to `base - 1`; `result` is now equal to `digits[1] * base + digits[2]`**
