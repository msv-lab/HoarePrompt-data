According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list, which must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is equal to `digit`, and `digits` must have at least 1 element. If the loop has executed once, it means that `digit` has taken the value of the first element in `digits`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 2 elements in `digits`. Thus, after the last iteration, we know that the iteration has been for the first digit, so in the next iteration, `digit` will take the second digit in the list. 

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and each digit must be in the range 0 to `base - 1`; `result` is equal to the second digit in the list.**
