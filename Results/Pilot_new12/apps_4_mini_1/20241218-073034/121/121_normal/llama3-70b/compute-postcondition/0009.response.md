Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length exactly `n`, and `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If `c` (which is `s[n-1]`) is not equal to '?', then the count for the key `c` is incremented by 1. The loop has processed up to `n-1` characters.***
