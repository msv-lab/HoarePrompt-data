Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect the original differences minus their respective counts processed. If `c` is '?', `s` is either empty or has unprocessed characters, and `res` contains the processed characters from `ACGT` based on the available counts. Otherwise, if `c` is not '?', `count['A']` reflects original differences minus at most 1 for the previous nucleotide (if the previous `c` was '?'), while `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` remain unchanged; `n` remains between 4 and 255; `s` has not been processed completely and now includes the next character; and `res` includes the newly processed character `c` from 'ACGT'.***
