The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count['A']` is `avg - original count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - original count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - original count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - original count['T']`, `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length exactly `n`, the first character `c` of `s` is '?', the current value of `count[nc]` is now `count[nc] - 1`, `res` is increased by `nc`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
