`The value of `s` is assigned the value of the input string, which must be of length `n`. The initial condition states that `s` consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The variable `n` remains unchanged since it still represents the predefined range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
