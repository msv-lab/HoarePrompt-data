Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the remaining counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`, `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is an empty string post-processing, `res` contains the resulting string with all `?` replaced and original characters. All values in `count` are zero, indicating that no nucleotides remain after processing.***
