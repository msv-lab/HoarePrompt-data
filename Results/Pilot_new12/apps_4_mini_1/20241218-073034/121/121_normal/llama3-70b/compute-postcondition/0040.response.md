Postcondition: ***`count['A']` is greater than 0, `count['G']` is greater than 0, `count['C']` is adjusted to reflect a decrement of 1 due to the loop logic, and `count['T']` remains unchanged; `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is '?', and `res` has been updated to include 'C'.***
