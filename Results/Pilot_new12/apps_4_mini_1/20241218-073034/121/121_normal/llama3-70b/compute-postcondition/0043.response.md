The operation `res += c` appends the character `c` to the string `res`. Since `c` is not equal to '?', it simply adds `c` to `res`, while other variables remain unchanged. The values of `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']`, `n`, and `s` remain the same.

Output State: **`count['A']` is `avg - original count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - original count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - original count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - original count['T']`, `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length exactly `n`, `c` is not equal to '?', and `res` is updated to include `c`.**
