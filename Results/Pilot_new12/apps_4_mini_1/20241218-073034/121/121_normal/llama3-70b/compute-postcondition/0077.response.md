Postcondition: ***`count['A']` reflects original differences minus at least 1; `count['C']` is decremented by 1; `count['G']` and `count['T']` remain unchanged; `n` stays between 4 and 255; `s` has at least 1 character less; `res` includes the processed characters plus an additional 'A' and now has an additional 'C'; `nc` is 'C', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, the next loop iteration will check `count['C']`.***
