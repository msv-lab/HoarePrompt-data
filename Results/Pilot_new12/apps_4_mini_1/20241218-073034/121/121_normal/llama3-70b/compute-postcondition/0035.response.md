Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` represent the differences between `avg` and the original counts of 'A', 'C', and `count['G']` is greater than 0. `count['T']` remains unchanged. `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, and the first character `c` of `s` is '?'. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by `nc`, and `count[nc]` is decreased by 1.***
