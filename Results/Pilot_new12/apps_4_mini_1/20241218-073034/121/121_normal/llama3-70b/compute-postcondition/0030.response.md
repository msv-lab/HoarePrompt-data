Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are the differences between `avg` and the original counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' respectively. `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length exactly `n`, and the first character `c` of `s` is '?'. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, and `res` is increased by `nc`, after which the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` is not greater than 0, the state of the program remains unchanged regarding the count variables or the result.***
