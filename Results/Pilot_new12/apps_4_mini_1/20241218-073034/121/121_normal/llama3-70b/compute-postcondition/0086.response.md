Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect original differences reflecting processed characters; `n` remains between 4 and 255; `s` has one less character; `res` includes processed characters based on all executed iterations, and no count remains negative. If `c` is '?', `count['A']` reflects original differences minus 1 or more, and `count['C']` reflects original value minus up to 1 or remains unchanged, while `count['G']` reflects original value minus up to 1 or remains unchanged, and `count['T']` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count['A']` reflects original differences minus at most 1 depending on the previous character processed, and `res` is equal to the previous `res` plus the newly processed character `c`.***
