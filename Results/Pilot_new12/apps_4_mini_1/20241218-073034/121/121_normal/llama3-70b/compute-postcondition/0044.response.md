Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` reflect the original differences minus at most 1 for the first nucleotide found if `c` is '?', otherwise they remain unchanged. `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length `n`, and if `c` is '?', `res` contains the first character from 'ACGT' that had a count greater than 0. If `c` is not '?', `res` is updated to include `c` and all counts remain as `avg - original count`.***
