Postcondition: ***`count['A']` remains unchanged, `count['C']` is greater than 0, `count['G']` is one less than before, `count['T']` remains unchanged, `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` has at least one character remaining to process, `res` includes the newly processed characters 'C' and 'G', and `nc` is 'G'. If `count[nc]` (which is `count['G']`) is greater than 0, then the appropriate updates to the counts and `res` occur, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
