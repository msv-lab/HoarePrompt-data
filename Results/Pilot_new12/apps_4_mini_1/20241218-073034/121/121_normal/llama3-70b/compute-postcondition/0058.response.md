The operation `res += nc` appends the value of `nc`, which is 'G', to `res`. So the value of `res` will now include an additional 'G'. The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`count['A']` remains unchanged, `count['C']` is greater than 0, `count['G']` remains unchanged, `count['T']` remains unchanged, `n` is between 4 and 255, `s` has at least one character remaining to process, `res` includes the newly processed character 'C' and 'G', `nc` is 'G'**.
