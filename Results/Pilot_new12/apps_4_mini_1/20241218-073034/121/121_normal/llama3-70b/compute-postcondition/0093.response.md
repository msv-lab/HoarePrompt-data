The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 4 and 255 (inclusive). The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` that consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. After executing the function body, the function's output would consist of some computed results based on these inputs. However, the specific return values are not provided. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 4 and 255 inclusive) and a string `s` (length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?').**
