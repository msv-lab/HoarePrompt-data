Postcondition: ***`count['A']` reflects original differences minus at least 1, `count['C']` is 0, `count['G']` is decremented by 1, `count['T']` remains unchanged; `n` stays between 4 and 255; `s` has at least 1 character less; `res` includes the processed characters plus an additional 'A', an additional 'C', and an additional 'G'; `nc` is 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop checking `count['C']` if `count[nc]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` remain unchanged, and no further processing occurs.***
