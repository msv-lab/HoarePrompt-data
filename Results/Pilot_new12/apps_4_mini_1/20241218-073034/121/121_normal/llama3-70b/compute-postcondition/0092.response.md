Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the remaining counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is an empty string post-processing, and `res` contains the resulting string with all `?` replaced and original characters. If at least one nucleotide count in `count` is greater than 0, the counts and the resulting string are updated accordingly. If all nucleotide counts are 0, then `res` is printed with the original characters and all `?` replaced.***
