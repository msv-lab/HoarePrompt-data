The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count['A']` is the difference between `avg` and the original count of 'A'; `count['C']` is the difference between `avg` and the original count of 'C'; `count['G']` is greater than 0; `count['T']` remains unchanged; `n` is between 4 and 255; `s` is a string of length exactly `n`; first character `c` of `s` is '?'; `res` is incremented by `nc`; `count[nc]` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
