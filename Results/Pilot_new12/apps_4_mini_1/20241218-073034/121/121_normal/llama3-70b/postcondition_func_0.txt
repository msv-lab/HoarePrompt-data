The function processes a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', by counting occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It computes the required counts for each nucleotide to achieve an equal distribution (one-fourth of `n`) and replaces each '?' in the string with the corresponding nucleotides, prioritizing those that still need counts. After processing, if any nucleotide count remains unmet (greater than 0), it prints '===', indicating that a balanced distribution is not possible; otherwise, it prints the newly formed string `res` which contains the original characters and all '?' replaced with the required nucleotides. Edge cases include the possibility of having too many '?' or not enough nucleotides to meet an equal distribution, which are handled by the checks on the final counts. The function does not return values; instead, it prints its outcomes directly.
