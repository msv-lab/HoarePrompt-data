Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
8
A??C??GT
```

Here's how the program processes this input:
- The count becomes: `A: 1, C: 1, G: 1, T: 1` and there are `4` '?' characters.
- The average required for each nucleotide type is `8 // 4 = 2`.
- It calculates how many more of each nucleotide is needed: `count` becomes `{'A': 1, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}` (indicating that we need one more of each nucleotide).
- When iterating through the '?' characters, the program will replace them with available nucleotides, potentially leading to: `AAGCCGTT`.

This output does not maintain an equal number of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides when decoded. The expected output in this case should be `===` since it's impossible to balance the nucleotides when starting with this particular input string.

Therefore, there are cases where the program fails to produce the correct result as specified in the problem description.
