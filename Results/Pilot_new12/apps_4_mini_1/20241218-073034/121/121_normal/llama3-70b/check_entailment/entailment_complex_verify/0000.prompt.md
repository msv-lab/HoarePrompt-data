You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the decoding of the genome string with respect to the requirements specified.

1. **Understanding Requirements**: The goal is to replace unrecognized nucleotides ('?') so that each of the four nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') occurs an equal number of times in the final string. If this is not possible, the program should return "===".

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The program reads two lines of input. The first is the length of the string (which is supposed to be a multiple of 4), and the second is the genome string itself.

3. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' while ignoring '?'. The average count for each nucleotide is calculated as `n // 4`. This is correct as it indicates how many of each nucleotide should be in the final decoded string.

4. **Replacement Logic**: The program attempts to replace '?' with the nucleotides that are currently underrepresented in the string, ensuring that each nucleotide can reach the average count.

5. **Final Check**: If after processing all '?', there are still some nucleotides left that are needed to reach the average count, the program correctly checks this using `if any(count.values()):` to determine if it should print "===".

**Potential Issues to Note**:
- The program does not handle the scenario where `n % 4 != 0` correctly. The problem states that the length will be within the range (4 to 255), but it does not explicitly guarantee that `n` will always be a multiple of 4. Therefore, if `n` is, for instance, 6, the average per nucleotide would be 1.5, which can lead to complications and ambiguities in nucleotide distribution.
  
- The example in the problem description where `n = 6` and consists of `????G?` should return "===" because it's not possible to have each letter the same when trying to achieve an equal distribution among 6 total characters (2 of each would require 8 total characters).

Given the above understanding, here is the correctness evaluation:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for cases where `n` is not a multiple of 4, which can lead to incorrect outputs for certain input strings. For example, an input of `????G?` leverages this flaw, and typically should return "===" due to the impossibility of equal distributions among a non-multiple of 4.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` contains the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`, and the total number of '?' in `s` does not affect the counts in `count`. `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and `s` is a string of length exactly `n`.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count['A']` is `avg - original count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - original count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - original count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - original count['T']`, `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length exactly `n`, `avg` is an integer between 1 and 63 (equal to `n // 4`).
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the remaining counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`, `n` is the initial integer between 4 and 255, `s` is an empty string post-processing, and `res` contains the resulting string with all `?` replaced and original characters.
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the remaining counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is an empty string post-processing, and `res` contains the resulting string with all `?` replaced and original characters. If at least one nucleotide count in `count` is greater than 0, the counts and the resulting string are updated accordingly. If all nucleotide counts are 0, then `res` is printed with the original characters and all `?` replaced.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', by counting occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It computes the required counts for each nucleotide to achieve an equal distribution (one-fourth of `n`) and replaces each '?' in the string with the corresponding nucleotides, prioritizing those that still need counts. After processing, if any nucleotide count remains unmet (greater than 0), it prints '===', indicating that a balanced distribution is not possible; otherwise, it prints the newly formed string `res` which contains the original characters and all '?' replaced with the required nucleotides. Edge cases include the possibility of having too many '?' or not enough nucleotides to meet an equal distribution, which are handled by the checks on the final counts. The function does not return values; instead, it prints its outcomes directly.
