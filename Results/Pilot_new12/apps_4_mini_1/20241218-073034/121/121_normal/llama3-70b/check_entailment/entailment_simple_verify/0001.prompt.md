You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
8
A??C??GT
```

Here's how the program processes this input:
- The count becomes: `A: 1, C: 1, G: 1, T: 1` and there are `4` '?' characters.
- The average required for each nucleotide type is `8 // 4 = 2`.
- It calculates how many more of each nucleotide is needed: `count` becomes `{'A': 1, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}` (indicating that we need one more of each nucleotide).
- When iterating through the '?' characters, the program will replace them with available nucleotides, potentially leading to: `AAGCCGTT`.

This output does not maintain an equal number of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides when decoded. The expected output in this case should be `===` since it's impossible to balance the nucleotides when starting with this particular input string.

Therefore, there are cases where the program fails to produce the correct result as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` contains the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`, and the total number of '?' in `s` does not affect the counts in `count`. `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and `s` is a string of length exactly `n`.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count['A']` is `avg - original count['A']`, `count['C']` is `avg - original count['C']`, `count['G']` is `avg - original count['G']`, `count['T']` is `avg - original count['T']`, `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a string of length exactly `n`, `avg` is an integer between 1 and 63 (equal to `n // 4`).
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the remaining counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`, `n` is the initial integer between 4 and 255, `s` is an empty string post-processing, and `res` contains the resulting string with all `?` replaced and original characters.
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` reflect the remaining counts of each nucleotide after processing all characters in `s`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is an empty string post-processing, and `res` contains the resulting string with all `?` replaced and original characters. If at least one nucleotide count in `count` is greater than 0, the counts and the resulting string are updated accordingly. If all nucleotide counts are 0, then `res` is printed with the original characters and all `?` replaced.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
