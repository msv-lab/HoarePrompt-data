Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' each equal to `target_count`, except for `char`, which is equal to `target_count + 2`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is updated to `target_count + 2`, `i` remains equal to `n`, and `result[n]` is equal to `char`, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
