Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4; counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], and counts['T']` each equal to `target_count + 1; i` is `n`; if `result[i]` is '?', then `result[n]` contains some distribution of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' based on how many times each has been assigned.***
