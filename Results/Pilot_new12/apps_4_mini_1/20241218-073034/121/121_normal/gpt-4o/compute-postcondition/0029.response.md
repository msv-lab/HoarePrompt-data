Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4, `s` is a string of length `len(s)`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` contains the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the program prints '===' to the console and returns nothing. Otherwise, the program does not perform any action.***
