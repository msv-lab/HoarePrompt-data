Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is a non-empty string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. The character `char` is one of the keys in the `counts` dictionary (i.e., 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T').***
