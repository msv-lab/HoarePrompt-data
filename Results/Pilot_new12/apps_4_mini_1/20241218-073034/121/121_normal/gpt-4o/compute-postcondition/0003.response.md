`The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[1]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255. However, `s` now holds the string from `data[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is now equal to `data[1]`.`

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is equal to `data[1]`.**
