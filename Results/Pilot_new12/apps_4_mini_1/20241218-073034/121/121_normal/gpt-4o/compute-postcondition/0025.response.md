Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4, `s` is a string of length `len(s)`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and for every character `char` in the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`.***
