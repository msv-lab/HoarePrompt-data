The `data` variable is assigned the result of `input().split()`, where `input` reads from `sys.stdin`, and `split()` will separate the input based on whitespace into a list. The variable `s` is unchanged, as it was just a string of length `n`. The variable `n` continues to hold its value within the defined range (4 ≤ n ≤ 255).

Therefore, `data` will hold a list of strings that were separated based on the whitespace from the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
