Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4; `counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], and counts['T']` are equal to `target_count`; if `result[i]` was '?', it is replaced by the respective character ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') based on the values in `counts`, ensuring that the total occurrences of each character in `result` still maintain the required `target_count`.***
