Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; all characters in `result` are from `s`, and if `result[i]` was '?', it has been replaced by 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' as necessary. Additionally, `counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], and counts['T']` remain equal to `target_count`.***
