The code `print('===')` executes a print statement that outputs the string '==='. It does not alter the values of any variables or affect the initial state of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count`; char is the key after 'T' which does not exist in counts.**
