Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' each equal to `target_count` except for `counts[char]`, which is equal to `target_count + 1`; `i` is `n`; if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[n]` is assigned `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
