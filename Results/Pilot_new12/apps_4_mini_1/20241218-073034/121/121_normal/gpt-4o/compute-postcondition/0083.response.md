The line `result[i] = char` assigns the value of `char` to the `i`-th index of the `result` list. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the assignment means that `result[n]` is now equal to `char`.

`n` remains unchanged, and the keys in `counts` are not impacted, as only the result list is modified. The state of `result` changes with the insertion of `char` at index `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' each equal to `target_count` except for `char`, which is equal to `target_count + 1`; `i` is `n`; `result[n]` is equal to `char`.**
