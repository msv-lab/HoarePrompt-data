Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; at least one of `counts['A'], `counts['C'], `counts['G'], or `counts['T']` is less than or equal to `target_count`; if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
