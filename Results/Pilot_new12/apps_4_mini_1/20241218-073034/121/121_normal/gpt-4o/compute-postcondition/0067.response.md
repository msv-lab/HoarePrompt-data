Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `i` is `n`, and `result[i]` is equal to `char`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
