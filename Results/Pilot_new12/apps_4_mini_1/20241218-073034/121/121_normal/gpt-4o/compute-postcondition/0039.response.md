Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4, `s` is a string of length `len(s)`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', `counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], counts['T']` must be less than or equal to `target_count`. The current value of `result[i]` is '?', and `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.***
