Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is a non-empty string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If `char` is in `counts`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `counts` remains unchanged.***
