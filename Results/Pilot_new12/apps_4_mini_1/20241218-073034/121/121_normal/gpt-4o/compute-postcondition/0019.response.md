Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters remaining, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If `char` is the second character in the string `s` and it is present in `counts`, then the count for `char` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
