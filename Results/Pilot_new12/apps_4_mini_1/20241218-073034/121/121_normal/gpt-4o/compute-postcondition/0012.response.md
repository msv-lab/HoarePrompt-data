The value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, where `char` is one of the keys in the `counts` dictionary. The previous values of `counts` were all set to 0, so the value for the specific `char` key in `counts` will now be 1 after the increment. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is a non-empty string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1.**
