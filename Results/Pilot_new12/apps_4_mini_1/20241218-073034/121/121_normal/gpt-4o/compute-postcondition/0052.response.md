The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; at least one of `counts['A'], `counts['C'], `counts['G'], or `counts['T']` is less than or equal to `target_count`.
