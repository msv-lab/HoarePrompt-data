`target_count` is assigned the value `n // 4`. Since `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and is divisible by 4, `target_count` will be an integer value representing the result of dividing `n` by 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is equal to `data[1]`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`.**
