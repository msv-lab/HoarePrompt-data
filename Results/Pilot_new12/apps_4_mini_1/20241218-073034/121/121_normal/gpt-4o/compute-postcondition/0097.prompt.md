You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None since there is no value specified to return after 'return'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is equal to `data[1]`. The integer `n` is divisible by 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' from the string `s`. If a character `char` in `s` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', then `counts[char]` will contain the number of occurrences of that character in `s`. If a character in `s` is not one of these, then `counts` remains unchanged for that character.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4, `s` is a string of length `len(s)`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` contains the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count` for all characters `char` in the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; each `counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], and counts['T']` is equal to `target_count`; `result` contains characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and all '?' have been replaced to ensure the counts meet the target requirement.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns None in various cases, or prints '===' to the console without returning a value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None since there is no value specified to return after 'return'

Case_2: The program returns None, as no specific value or variable is being returned, the 'return' statement is without any value

Case_3: The program returns nothing, as it is instructed to only print '===' to the console without returning any value.

Case_4: The program returns None, as there is nothing explicitly returned or calculated.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
