The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the execution of the function body, it can have multiple outcomes: 

Case_1: The function returns `None` since there is no value specified to return after 'return'.

Case_2: The function returns `None`, as no specific value or variable is being returned; the 'return' statement is without any value.

Case_3: The function returns nothing, as it is instructed to only print '===' to the console without returning any value.

Case_4: The function returns `None`, as there is nothing explicitly returned or calculated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is that it does not accept any parameters and primarily results in `None` or performs a console output without returning a calculable value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns None in various cases, or prints '===' to the console without returning a value.**
