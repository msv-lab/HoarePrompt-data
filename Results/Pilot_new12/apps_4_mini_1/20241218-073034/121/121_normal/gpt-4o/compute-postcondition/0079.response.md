The variable `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. The current value of `counts[char]` is equal to `target_count`, therefore after the increment it will be `target_count + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the updated value of `counts[char]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` has keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' each equal to `target_count` except for `counts[char]` which is equal to `target_count + 1`; `i` is `n`; `result[n]` is `char`.**
