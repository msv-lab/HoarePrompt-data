The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State retains all the valid information regarding the preconditions. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], and counts['T']` must be less than or equal to `target_count`; `counts[char]` is equal to its previous value plus 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
