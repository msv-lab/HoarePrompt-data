Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the decoding of the mammoth's genome as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, which aligns with the expectations from the problem description.

2. **Check for Divisibility**: The program checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If it is not, it immediately outputs "===" since it would be impossible to have an equal number of nucleotides for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

3. **Count Existing Nucleotides**: It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`. This is essential to determine how many of each nucleotide need to be added to replace the '?' characters.

4. **Validation of Counts**: The program checks if any nucleotide already exceeds the target count (which is `n // 4`); if any nucleotide is found to be greater than this count, the program outputs "===" because it cannot balance the nucleotide counts with the available '?' characters.

5. **Replacement Logic**: The program iterates through the string, and for each '?', it replaces it with a nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', or 'T') that still has a count below the target. This ensures that the final result meets the requirement of having equal counts for all nucleotide types.

6. **Final Output**: Finally, it outputs the modified string where all 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides have equal counts, or it outputs "===" where it's impossible to decode as required.

The logic flow is clear and handles the conditions laid out in the problem statement effectively. The program correctly guarantees that the number of each nucleotide is equal if possible, and returns the appropriate value otherwise. Hence, it is considered correct according to the problem description.
