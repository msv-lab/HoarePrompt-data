You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. One specific example where the program fails is when the input string has all unrecognized nucleotides and the length is a multiple of four, but not enough characters can be filled to maintain an equal number of each nucleotide type.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
8
????
```

In this case, `n = 8` which is a multiple of 4, so the program would proceed to try and fill the string with equal numbers of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Each of these nucleotides should occur exactly `2` times (since 8 / 4 = 2). The program could potentially output `AACCGGTT` or `ACGTACGT`, but it does not handle the case correctly where it might need to impose further restrictions on the initial counts.

Additionally, consider the input:
```
4
CA??
```

The current counts would suggest an attempt to fill in the two question marks. However, this could lead to an incorrect output if the implementation does not correctly ensure that filling each '?' results in maintaining the overall balance needed.

Thus, the program cannot guarantee correctness for all potential input cases leading me to conclude the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None since there is no value specified to return after 'return'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is equal to `data[1]`. The integer `n` is divisible by 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and `n` is divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts` contains the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' from the string `s`. If a character `char` in `s` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', then `counts[char]` will contain the number of occurrences of that character in `s`. If a character in `s` is not one of these, then `counts` remains unchanged for that character.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4, `s` is a string of length `len(s)`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` contains the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with `counts[char]` less than or equal to `target_count` for all characters `char` in the keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255 and divisible by 4; `s` is a string of length `len(s)`; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; each `counts['A'], counts['C'], counts['G'], and counts['T']` is equal to `target_count`; `result` contains characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and all '?' have been replaced to ensure the counts meet the target requirement.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` containing the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. If `n` is not divisible by 4, it prints '===' and exits. The function counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and checks if any character appears more than `n // 4` times; if so, it prints '===' and exits. If all characters are within the limit, the function replaces any '?' in the string with the appropriate characters to ensure that each of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' appears exactly `n // 4` times. Finally, it prints the modified string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints outputs based on certain conditions. The missing functionality includes handling cases for invalid characters outside 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' as well as a lack of error messages for invalid string compositions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
