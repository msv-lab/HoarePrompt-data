Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input string might contain invalid characters outside of the allowed 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. According to the problem description, all characters should only be in this specified set. Therefore, if the input string contains any other character (e.g., numbers, lowercase letters, or symbols), the program would still operate without any checks and could lead to unexpected results. 

For instance, if the input string were to be "A1C?G?", the program would not recognize the '1' as invalid, and it might produce an output that doesn't adhere to the problem's constraints, violating the requirement. The program should include a validation step to check for such invalid characters and print '===' if any are found.

Additionally, the program checks if `n` is divisible by 4 but doesn't validate that the length of `s` corresponds to `n`, potentially leading to mismatches. These oversights indicate that the program is not robust enough under all circumstances described in the problem statement, thus rendering it incorrect.
