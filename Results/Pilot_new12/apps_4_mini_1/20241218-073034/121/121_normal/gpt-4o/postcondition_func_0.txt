The function reads an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and a string `s` of length `n` containing the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. If `n` is not divisible by 4, it prints '===' and exits. The function counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and checks if any character appears more than `n // 4` times; if so, it prints '===' and exits. If all characters are within the limit, the function replaces any '?' in the string with the appropriate characters to ensure that each of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' appears exactly `n // 4` times. Finally, it prints the modified string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints outputs based on certain conditions. The missing functionality includes handling cases for invalid characters outside 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' as well as a lack of error messages for invalid string compositions.
