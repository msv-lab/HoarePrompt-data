The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a directed graph, an integer `m` representing the number of directed edges, and a list of tuples `edges` that represent directed edges from one vertex to another. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the directed graph and checks for cycles. If the graph is acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If any edge removal leads to a cycle, it returns 'NO' after checking all edges. The function ultimately determines if the directed graph can be processed without forming cycles when edges are considered individually. Edge cases such as input values that lie within the defined constraints (like minimal and maximal edge and vertex counts) are implicitly managed. The implementation assumes that the method `has_cycle(graph)` is defined elsewhere and performs the necessary cycle detection.
