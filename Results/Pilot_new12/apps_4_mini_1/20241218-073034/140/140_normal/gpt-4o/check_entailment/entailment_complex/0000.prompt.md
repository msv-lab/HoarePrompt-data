You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in a directed graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) contains two distinct integers representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` tuples, for each edge (u, v) in `edges`, `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, and `graph` is a defaultdict with lists representing the adjacency list of the directed graph.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES' indicating that the directed graph represented by the adjacency list in 'graph' is valid and does not contain a cycle.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` tuples, for each edge (u, v) in `edges`, `v` is appended to `graph[u]`, and `graph` is a defaultdict with lists representing the adjacency list of the directed graph. The directed graph represented by `graph` does not contain any cycles.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` tuples, `graph` remains a directed acyclic graph formed by removing each edge (u, v) sequentially, and has no cycles after all edges are processed.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating a specific condition or response related to the directed acyclic graph formed by edges in the input, without detail on the specific cycle-checking or graph-processing logic
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a directed graph, an integer `m` representing the number of directed edges, and a list of tuples `edges` that represent directed edges from one vertex to another. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the directed graph and checks for cycles. If the graph is acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If any edge removal leads to a cycle, it returns 'NO' after checking all edges. The function ultimately determines if the directed graph can be processed without forming cycles when edges are considered individually. Edge cases such as input values that lie within the defined constraints (like minimal and maximal edge and vertex counts) are implicitly managed. The implementation assumes that the method `has_cycle(graph)` is defined elsewhere and performs the necessary cycle detection.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices, such that n >= 2.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`, with all original values of `in_degree` being non-negative integers.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is equal to the number of vertices in the graph with `in_degree` of 0, `in_degree[v]` for each vertex `v` is the count of incoming edges after processing, `queue` is empty, indicating all vertices with no incoming edges have been processed. If `count` equals the total number of vertices `n`, then all vertices are reachable from the initial nodes in `queue`. If `count` is less than `n`, some vertices remain unprocessed due to having at least one incoming edge.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if count is less than n, indicating some vertices remain unprocessed due to having at least one incoming edge; it returns False if count equals n, indicating all vertices are reachable from the initial nodes in queue.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph with integer vertices. It calculates the in-degrees of each vertex and determines whether a cycle exists in the graph by checking if all vertices can be processed given their incoming edges. The function returns `True` if there are some vertices that could not be processed due to having incoming edges, indicating the presence of cycles; it returns `False` if all vertices are reachable, suggesting that there are no cycles present. The function does not handle graphs with missing vertices (not present in the keys of `graph`) or cases where the graph is empty, which could give misleading results. Additionally, it assumes that the input is well-formed with valid integer keys and edges.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
