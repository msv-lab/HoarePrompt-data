To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we can analyze how the program operates and consider potential edge cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Graph Representation**: The program uses a directed graph represented by an adjacency list with the `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.

2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function checks for cycles using a method that counts in-degrees and performs a topological sort via Kahn's algorithm. If the count of visited nodes doesn't equal the total number of nodes, it indicates a cycle exists.

3. **Edge Removal for Cycle Prevention**: The main function `func_1` first checks if the graph is acyclic without removing any edges. If not, it attempts to remove each edge one by one and checks if the graph becomes acyclic after each removal.

### Potential Issues:
- The program fails to address a situation where removing one edge may not be sufficient to make the graph acyclic, specifically if there are multiple cycles entangled with the same vertices.
  
### Test Case Consideration:
Consider the directed graph input where:
```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```

In this case:
- There is a cycle present (1 → 2 → 3 → 1).
- By removing the edge `2 → 3`, the graph becomes acyclic.

However, if we consider:
```
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
1 4
```
Here, there is a cycle (2 → 3 → 4 → 2), and removing any single edge does not eliminate the cycle. The program would incorrectly return "YES" after checking each edge removal, while the correct result should be "NO".

### Conclusion:
The algorithm should correctly address the need to check multiple cycle dependencies, where simply removing one edge may not suffice to make the graph acyclic in more complex scenarios.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **False**
