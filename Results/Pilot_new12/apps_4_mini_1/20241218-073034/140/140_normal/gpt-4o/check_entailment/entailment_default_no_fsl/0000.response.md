To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description in detail.

### Problem Description Summary
The goal is to determine whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. A directed graph is acyclic if it contains no cycles.

### Provided Code Functionality
1. The function `func_1` constructs a graph using an adjacency list from the edges provided.
2. It checks if the graph is already acyclic using the `has_cycle` function.
3. If the graph has a cycle, it iterates through each edge, temporarily removes it, and checks if the resulting graph becomes acyclic.
4. If it finds any configuration that results in an acyclic graph, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
5. The `has_cycle` function checks for cycles using topological sorting through in-degrees.

### Assessment of the Code
- The function assumes that the presence of any remaining vertices in the in-degree count must be zero for the graph to be acyclic, implying that all vertices need to be reachable without cycles.
- If an edge is removed, it must be checked whether this asynchronous condition holds for all vertices.
  
### Potential Issues
One critical aspect is that the `has_cycle` function does not properly handle vertices that may not have any incoming edges or outgoing edges but are part of the graph. Specifically, the graph representation is based on nodes with edges, but the cycle detection does not account for disconnected vertices or correctly infer a cycle that may exist from those nodes. 

The output hints mention that it should return 'YES' if the graph can be acyclic after removing one edge. However, if we consider a graph with disconnected components or lots of in-degrees that don't lead to processing all nodes, the results may be misleading. 

### Edge Cases
1. A graph with no edges should return 'YES' because it is inherently acyclic.
2. Any graph with multiple cycles directly connected would require more than one edge removal to resolve, and the current implementation might not handle it if the edges are interconnected in a way that a singular removal isnâ€™t sufficient.

### Conclusion
The mentioned limitations could lead to cases where the function incorrectly returns 'YES' or 'NO', particularly in scenarios with complications in cyclic connectivity. Hence, there will be cases where the output does not adhere strictly to the problem description.

Therefore, the conclusion about the correctness of the program based on the analysis is:

Correctness: **False**
