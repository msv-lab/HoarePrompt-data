The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph with integer vertices. It calculates the in-degrees of each vertex and determines whether a cycle exists in the graph by checking if all vertices can be processed given their incoming edges. The function returns `True` if there are some vertices that could not be processed due to having incoming edges, indicating the presence of cycles; it returns `False` if all vertices are reachable, suggesting that there are no cycles present. The function does not handle graphs with missing vertices (not present in the keys of `graph`) or cases where the graph is empty, which could give misleading results. Additionally, it assumes that the input is well-formed with valid integer keys and edges.
