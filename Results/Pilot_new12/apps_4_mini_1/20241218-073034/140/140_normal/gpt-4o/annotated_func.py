    #The program returns 'NO', indicating a specific condition or response related to the directed acyclic graph formed by edges in the input, without detail on the specific cycle-checking or graph-processing logic
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a directed graph, an integer `m` representing the number of directed edges, and a list of tuples `edges` that represent directed edges from one vertex to another. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the directed graph and checks for cycles. If the graph is acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If any edge removal leads to a cycle, it returns 'NO' after checking all edges. The function ultimately determines if the directed graph can be processed without forming cycles when edges are considered individually. Edge cases such as input values that lie within the defined constraints (like minimal and maximal edge and vertex counts) are implicitly managed. The implementation assumes that the method `has_cycle(graph)` is defined elsewhere and performs the necessary cycle detection.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices, such that n >= 2.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`, with all original values of `in_degree` being non-negative integers.

        node = queue.popleft()

            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is equal to the number of vertices in the graph with `in_degree` of 0, `in_degree[v]` for each vertex `v` is the count of incoming edges after processing, `queue` is empty, indicating all vertices with no incoming edges have been processed. If `count` equals the total number of vertices `n`, then all vertices are reachable from the initial nodes in `queue`. If `count` is less than `n`, some vertices remain unprocessed due to having at least one incoming edge.
    return count != n
    #The program returns True if count is less than n, indicating some vertices remain unprocessed due to having at least one incoming edge; it returns False if count equals n, indicating all vertices are reachable from the initial nodes in queue.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary representing a directed graph with integer vertices. It calculates the in-degrees of each vertex and determines whether a cycle exists in the graph by checking if all vertices can be processed given their incoming edges. The function returns `True` if there are some vertices that could not be processed due to having incoming edges, indicating the presence of cycles; it returns `False` if all vertices are reachable, suggesting that there are no cycles present. The function does not handle graphs with missing vertices (not present in the keys of `graph`) or cases where the graph is empty, which could give misleading results. Additionally, it assumes that the input is well-formed with valid integer keys and edges.
