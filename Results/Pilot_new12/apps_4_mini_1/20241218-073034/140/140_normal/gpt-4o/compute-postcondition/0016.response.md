Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys; `u` is a key in `graph`, `in_degree` contains the in-degrees of all elements in `graph[u]` incremented by 1 for each element in `graph[u]`. If `graph[u]` has `n` elements, then `in_degree[v]` is equal to the original in-degree of `v` plus `n`.**
