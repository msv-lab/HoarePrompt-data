According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the structure of the `graph`. The loop will iterate over the keys of the `graph`, which means it will execute if `graph` has at least one key. Given that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices and must be at least 2, `graph` must contain at least two vertices (1 and 2, for example). Since `in_degree` has all values initialized to 0, it does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `graph` must have at least one key and `u` must be the first vertex in the dictionary. Since `n >= 2`, we can conclude that `graph` should at least contain integer keys from 1 to n.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys (1 to n), `u` is the first key in the graph**
