Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`, `queue` contains at least one node from which the first node is removed, `count` is 0, and `node` is now the value of the dequeued node from `queue`.**
