The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the `queue`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. Given that `in_degree[neighbor]` is currently 0, adding `neighbor` to the `queue` implies that it is being processed now.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one neighbor for `node`, `count` is 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `current value of in_degree[neighbor]` is 0; `neighbor` is appended to `queue`.**
