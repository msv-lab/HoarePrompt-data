The operation `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the `queue`. Since the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, it indicates that `neighbor` has no remaining dependencies and is therefore ready to be processed. The state of `count`, `node`, `graph[node]`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` remain unchanged as a result of this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `node` is defined, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, and `neighbor` is now appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`count` is 3, `node` is defined, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `neighbor` is appended to `queue`.**
