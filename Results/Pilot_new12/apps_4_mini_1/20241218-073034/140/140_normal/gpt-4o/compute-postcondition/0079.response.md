Output State: **`count` is equal to the number of vertices in the graph with `in_degree` of 0, `in_degree[v]` for each vertex `v` is the count of incoming edges after processing, `queue` is empty, indicating all vertices with no incoming edges have been processed. If `count` equals the total number of vertices `n`, then all vertices are reachable from the initial nodes in `queue`. If `count` is less than `n`, some vertices remain unprocessed due to having at least one incoming edge.**
