According to the code, the loop iterates over each key `u` in the `graph`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more key in the `graph`. At the end of the last iteration, `graph` has at least 2 keys, meaning one key has already been processed. 

To execute one more time, `u` must be the next key in the dictionary, and since at least one key has already been processed, there needs to be at least 2 keys left in the graph for the loop to keep iterating.

Thus, the next state would be:
State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys remaining; `u` is the next key in `graph`, `in_degree` must reflect the in-degrees of all elements in `graph[u]` incremented by 1 for each of the elements in `graph[u]`.**
