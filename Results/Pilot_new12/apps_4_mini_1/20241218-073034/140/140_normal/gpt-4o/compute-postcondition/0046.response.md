`node` is assigned the value of the first element removed from `queue` using the `popleft()` method. The value of `count` remains unchanged at 1. The condition states that at least one neighbor's `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0, ensuring that `queue` is not empty. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`count` is 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` for each neighbor has been decremented by 1, at least one `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0, and `node` is the first element removed from `queue`.**
