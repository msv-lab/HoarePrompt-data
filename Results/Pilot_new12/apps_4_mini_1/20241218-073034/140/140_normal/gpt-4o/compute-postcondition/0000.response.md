The code initializes the `in_degree` dictionary where each key is an integer representing a vertex (from 1 to n), and each value starts as 0, indicating that initially, each vertex has an in-degree of zero. The number of vertices is represented by the variable `n`, which is at least 2. Therefore, after executing the code, the `in_degree` dictionary will have entries for each vertex from 1 to n with values set to 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, such that n >= 2; `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to n and all values are 0.**
