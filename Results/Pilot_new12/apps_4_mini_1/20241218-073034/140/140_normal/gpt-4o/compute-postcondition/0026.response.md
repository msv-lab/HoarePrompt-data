The code initializes `queue` with a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where the count of incoming edges is zero. The values of `in_degree` are not modified, and `queue` is now a specific collection of those vertices (nodes) with zero incoming edges.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n` (non-negative integers), `queue` is a deque containing the nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`.**
