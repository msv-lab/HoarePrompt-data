The variable `count` is set to 0. The initial states of `graph`, `in_degree`, and `queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n` (non-negative integers), `queue` is a deque containing the nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`, `count` is 0**.
