The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the `queue`. The variables that are relevant to this operation are `queue` and `neighbor`. 

The state of `count` remains unchanged at 2, and `in_degree[neighbor]` being decremented means it is not directly affected by this operation, still holding the property of being less than or equal to -2.

The value of `node` is also unchanged as it simply represents the first element removed from `queue`. However, we are now dealing with `neighbor`, which is an element that gets added to the queue.

Thus, we have:
- `count` is still 2.
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is unchanged in state but continues to have the property of being less than or equal to -2.
- `node` remains as the first element removed.
- `neighbor` is now appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `in_degree[neighbor]` is less than or equal to -2, `node` is the first element removed from `queue`, and `neighbor` has been appended to `queue`.**
