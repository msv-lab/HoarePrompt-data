To determine the output state after the completion of the loop, we analyze the given code and the initial state. The loop iterates over the `graph`, which is a dictionary where each key represents a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of directed edges to other vertices. 

During each iteration of the outer loop, for each vertex `u`, the inner loop iterates over all vertices `v` that can be reached from `u`. For each directed edge from `u` to `v`, the in-degree of `v` is incremented in the `in_degree` dictionary.

After the loop has executed for all vertices in the graph:

- The variable `in_degree` will contain the total number of incoming edges for each vertex from 1 to `n`.
- Each entry in `in_degree` will be the original value plus the count of edges from other vertices leading to that vertex.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, we can state that:

1. `graph` remains unchanged; it still represents the original structure of the directed graph.
2. Each key `v` in `in_degree` has been incremented based on how many times it was referenced in `graph[u]`, which counts all incoming edges.

Given that `n` is at least 2, there are always at least two vertices in the graph, and thus the loop will cover all vertices and edges properly.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`, with all original values of `in_degree` being non-negative integers.**
