The variable `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but this operation implies that there is a specific key `v` which exists in the `in_degree` dictionary. The information about the structure of `graph` is retained, showing that `graph` is still a dictionary with at least 2 keys, with `u` being the first key. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `u` is the first key in `graph`, `graph[u]` must contain at least 1 element, `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1.**
