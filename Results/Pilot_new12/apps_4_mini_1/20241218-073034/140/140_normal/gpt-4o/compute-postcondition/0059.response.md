The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. Since `count`, `in_degree[neighbor]`, and `node` do not change because of this operation, their states remain the same. The `queue` is updated to include `neighbor` as the last element. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `in_degree[neighbor]` is less than or equal to -3, `node` is still the first element removed from `queue`, and now `queue` includes `neighbor` at the end.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `in_degree[neighbor]` is less than or equal to -3, `node` is still the first element removed from `queue`, and `queue` now includes `neighbor` at the end.**
