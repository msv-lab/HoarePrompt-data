The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The precondition states that `in_degree[v]` has already been incremented by 1, and now it will increase by 1 again, making it a total of 2 increments. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `u` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[u]` has at least 2 elements, and `in_degree[v]` has been incremented by 2.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `u` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[u]` has at least 2 elements, and `in_degree[v]` has been incremented by 2.**
