Initial State: `count` is 3, `node` is the first element removed from `queue`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 for all neighbors appended to `queue`, and `queue` is updated to exclude the first element.

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `count` is 3, `node` is defined, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is appended to `queue`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `count` is 3, `node` is defined, `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors, `neighbor` is the second neighbor in the list, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is appended to `queue`.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `count` is 3, `node` is defined, `graph[node]` has at least 3 neighbors, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased to 0, then `neighbor` is appended to `queue`.

If the loop executes for all neighbors of `node`, it implies that `graph[node]` contains a total of `N` neighbors where `N` is at least equal to the count of neighbors processed. Every `neighbor` processed leads to either a decrease in its `in_degree` or an append to `queue` if its in_degree reaches 0.

Output State: **`count` is 3, `node` is defined, `queue` contains all neighbors of `node` that had their `in_degree` decremented to 0, and `in_degree[neighbor]` for each `neighbor` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on how many neighbors were processed.**
