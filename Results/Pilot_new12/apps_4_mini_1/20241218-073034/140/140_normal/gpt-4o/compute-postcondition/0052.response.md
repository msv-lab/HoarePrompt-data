Postcondition: ***`count` is 2, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, at least one `in_degree[neighbor]` is less than or equal to -1, `node` is the first element removed from `queue`, `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0, then `queue` now includes `neighbor`.***
