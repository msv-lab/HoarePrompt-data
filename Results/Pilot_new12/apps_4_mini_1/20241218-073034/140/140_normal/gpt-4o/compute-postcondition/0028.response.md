According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. The loop can execute as long as `queue` contains elements. Right before the loop, `queue` is initialized with nodes where `in_degree[node] == 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `queue` must not be empty, implying that at least one node should exist in `queue`. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one node in `queue` before the loop starts.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary with vertices from 1 to `n`, `in_degree[v]` is the total count of incoming edges for each vertex `v` from 1 to `n` (non-negative integers), `queue` must contain at least one node (i.e., `in_degree[node] == 0` for some node), `count` is 0**
