`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The variable `v` is the first element of the list or iterable pointed to by `graph[u]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `u` is a key in `graph` that points to a list or iterable with at least 1 element, `v` is now the first element of `graph[u]`, and `in_degree[v]` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `u` is a key in `graph` that points to a list or iterable with at least 1 element, `v` is the first element of `graph[u]`, `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1.**
