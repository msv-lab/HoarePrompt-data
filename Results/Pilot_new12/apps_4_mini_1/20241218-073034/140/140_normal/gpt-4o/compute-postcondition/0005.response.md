The value of `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1. The initial state indicates that `graph` is a dictionary containing at least two keys, and `u` is the first key in `graph`. The entry `graph[u]` has at least two elements, implying there exists a next element `v` in `graph[u]`. Therefore `in_degree[v]` will be incremented by 1, while the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `u` is the first key in `graph`, `graph[u]` contains at least 2 elements, `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1**.
