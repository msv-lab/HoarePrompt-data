The operation `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. Since `neighbor` is a valid element of the graph corresponding to the `node`, and given that `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0, it means that this `neighbor` has no remaining incoming edges and is ready to be processed. 

The previous state of `count` remains unchanged, while the state of `queue` will now include `neighbor` as an additional element. 

Output State: **`count` is 2, `in_degree[neighbor]` has been decremented by 1; at least one `in_degree[neighbor]` is now less than or equal to -1, `node` is the first element removed from `queue`, `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, and the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0; `queue` now includes `neighbor`.**
