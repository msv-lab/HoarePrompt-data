node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex (1 ≤ node ≤ n), visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of boolean values indicating the recursion stack state for each vertex.
