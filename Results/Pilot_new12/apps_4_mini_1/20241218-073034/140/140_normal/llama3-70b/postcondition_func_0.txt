The function `func_1` is designed to detect cycles in a directed graph represented as a list of adjacency lists. It accepts four parameters: `node`, an integer representing the current vertex to explore; `graph`, a list of lists where each sublist contains directed edges from the corresponding vertex; `visited`, a list of boolean values indicating which vertices have been traversed; and `rec_stack`, a list of boolean values representing the vertices currently in the recursion stack. Upon execution, the function marks the current node as visited and adds it to the recursion stack. It then recursively examines each unvisited neighbor of the current node. If a visited neighbor is found which is also in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`. If all neighbors are explored without finding a cycle, the function marks the current node as not in the recursion stack and returns `False`. The overall functionality thus checks for cycles in the directed graph, providing a boolean output indicating the presence or absence of cycles. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases where the input `node` may be out of bounds, which could lead to index errors. Therefore, handling for such edge cases is a missing element in the current implementation.
