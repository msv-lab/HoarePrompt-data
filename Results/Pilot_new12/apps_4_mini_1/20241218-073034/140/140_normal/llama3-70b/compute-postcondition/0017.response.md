Postcondition: ***`node` is a valid index for `graph`, which contains at least one neighbor. If the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` successfully evaluates the neighbor at index `i + 1`, the program returns True. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is true, the function also returns True, indicating a valid evaluation of that neighbor.***
