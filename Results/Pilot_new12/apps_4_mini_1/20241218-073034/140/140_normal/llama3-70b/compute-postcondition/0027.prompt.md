You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex (1 ≤ node ≤ n), visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of boolean values indicating the recursion stack state for each vertex.
```
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the function `func_1` confirmed the condition for the given `neighbor`, which is a valid index in `graph`, and that there is an unvisited neighbor, leading to a successful traversal or detection of a condition in the graph.

Case_2: The program returns True because there is at least one neighbor of `node` whose `visited` status is True and `rec_stack` for that neighbor is also True, indicating a potential cycle in the graph.

Case_3: The program returns True indicating a valid evaluation of the neighbor neighbor[i + 1] from the graph at the specified node index.

Case_4: The program returns True indicating that the evaluation of the neighbor at index `i + 1` is successful, and the variable `node` is a valid index for `graph`, which contains at least one neighbor.

Case_5: The program returns True, indicating that the function executes successfully when `node` is a valid index for `graph`, which contains at least `i + 2` neighbors.

Case_6: The program returns True, indicating that the condition for the 'node' being a valid index for 'graph' and having at least 'i + 2' neighbors is satisfied.

Case_7: The program returns False, indicating that there are no cycles detected in the graph for the current node since all neighbors have been evaluated and did not lead to a cycle.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
