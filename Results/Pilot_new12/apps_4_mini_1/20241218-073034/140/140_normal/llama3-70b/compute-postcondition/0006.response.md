Postcondition: ***`node` must be a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor, and the current state is such that for at least one neighbor of `node`, `visited[neighbor]` is False (not visited). Additionally, for the neighbor `neighbor`, the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` did not return True; thus, it may be the case that either `visited[neighbor]` is True or the recursive call did not lead to a cycle being detected.***
