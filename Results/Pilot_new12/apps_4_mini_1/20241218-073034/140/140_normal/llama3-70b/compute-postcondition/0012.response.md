According to the code, the for loop iterates over the neighbors of a specific `node` in the `graph`. At the end of the last iteration, `node` is a valid index, meaning that `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor, and we had information about the visited status of those neighbors.

Since `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor and the loop would go through each of those neighbors one by one, when one iteration ends, the loop is prepared to execute for the next neighbor in the list of neighbors for `node`. Let's denote the number of neighbors as `num_neighbors`. If all neighbors have been visited, it indicates `visited[neighbor]` is True for at least one neighbor, meaning that all remaining neighbors can be maintained as visited after the current loop iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to reflect the next neighbor in the list. Thus, if we denote the current neighbor being processed as having an index of `i`, for the loop to execute again, the index should now point to the next neighbor, `i + 1`, and the status of that next neighbor should be considered.

Thus, if `i` is currently the index of the last processed neighbor, the state can be updated:

State: **`node` is a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor, the neighbor being evaluated is `neighbor[i + 1]`, index is `i + 1`.**
