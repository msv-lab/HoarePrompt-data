The variable `rec_stack[node]` is assigned the value `True`, indicating that the current vertex `node` is now marked as being in the recursion stack. The other variablesâ€™ states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex, `visited` now marks `visited[node]` as True, `rec_stack` indicates that `rec_stack[node]` is True.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex, `visited` now marks `visited[node]` as True, `rec_stack[node]` is True.**
