Postcondition: ***`node` is a valid index for `graph`, which contains at least `i + 2` neighbors. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, the function returns True if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` executes successfully. Otherwise, if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, indicating that the condition for the node is satisfied.***
