The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing the current vertex in the graph. 
- `graph` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex. 
- `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited. 
- `rec_stack` is a list of boolean values indicating the recursion stack state for each vertex.

After executing the function body, several outputs may occur based on different conditions:

- **Case 1**: The program returns `True`, indicating successful traversal or detection of a condition in the graph for an unvisited neighbor.
- **Case 2**: The program returns `True` due to the detection of a potential cycle in the graph, where at least one neighbor of `node` has been visited and is on the recursion stack.
- **Case 3**: The program returns `True`, signifying a valid evaluation of a neighbor from the graph at the specified `node` index.
- **Case 4**: The program returns `True`, indicating successful evaluation of a neighbor at an index in the graph, with `node` being a valid index.
- **Case 5**: The program returns `True`, confirming that the function executes successfully when `node` has a sufficient number of neighbors in the graph.
- **Case 6**: The program returns `True`, indicating validation of the `node` as a valid index in the graph with a specific condition for neighbors.
- **Case 7**: The program returns `False`, indicating that there are no cycles detected in the graph for the current node, as all neighbors have been evaluated without leading to a cycle.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a vertex `node` along with the graph structure and its states, and it returns either `True` or `False` based on the presence of cycles or successful evaluations of neighboring nodes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`, and it returns `True` or `False` based on whether cycles are detected or valid traversals are performed in the graph.**
