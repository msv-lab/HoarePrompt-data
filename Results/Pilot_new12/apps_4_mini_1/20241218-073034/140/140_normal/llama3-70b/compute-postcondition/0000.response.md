The code sets the element at the index `node` in the `visited` list to `True`. Given that `node` is an integer representing the current vertex, this change indicates that the vertex corresponding to `node` has now been marked as visited. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex, `visited` now marks `visited[node]` as True, `rec_stack` is a list of boolean values indicating the recursion stack state for each vertex.**
