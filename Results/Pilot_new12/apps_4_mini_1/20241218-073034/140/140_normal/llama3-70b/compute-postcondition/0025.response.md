Output State: **`visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is False, all neighbors of `node` have been evaluated. If a neighbor has not been visited, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` has been called for that neighbor. If a neighbor has been visited, for each visited neighbor, `rec_stack[neighbor]` reflects their inclusion in the recursion stack at some point during the exploration. Additionally, if any neighbor has led to a cycle, the function would have returned True.**
