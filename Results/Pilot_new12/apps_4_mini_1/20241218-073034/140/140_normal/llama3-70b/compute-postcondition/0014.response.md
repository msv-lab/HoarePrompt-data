Postcondition: ***`node` is a valid index for `graph`, and `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor. If the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` evaluates the neighbor at index `i + 1` successfully, the program returns True, indicating a valid evaluation of that neighbor. If the function does not return True, there is no further action specified in the else part.***
