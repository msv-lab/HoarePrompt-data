Postcondition: ***`node` is a valid index for `graph` and `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor. If there is at least one neighbor of `node` that has not been visited, then for that neighbor, the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` did not return True, indicating that `visited[neighbor]` may be True or the call did not lead to a cycle detection. If all neighbors of `node` have been visited, then `visited[neighbor]` is True for at least one neighbor and `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False for all neighbors of `node`.***
