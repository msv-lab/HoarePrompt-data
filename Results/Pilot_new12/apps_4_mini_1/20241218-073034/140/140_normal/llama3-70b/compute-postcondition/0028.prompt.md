You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex (1 ≤ node ≤ n), visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of boolean values indicating the recursion stack state for each vertex.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, all neighbors of `node` have been evaluated. If a neighbor has not been visited, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` has been called for that neighbor. If a neighbor has been visited, for each visited neighbor, `rec_stack[neighbor]` whether True or False reflects their inclusion in the recursion stack at some point during the exploration. Additionally, if any neighbor has led to a cycle, the function would have returned True.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no cycles detected in the graph for the current node since all neighbors have been evaluated and did not lead to a cycle.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`, and it returns `True` or `False` based on whether cycles are detected or valid traversals are performed in the graph.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the function `func_1` confirmed the condition for the given `neighbor`, which is a valid index in `graph`, and that there is an unvisited neighbor, leading to a successful traversal or detection of a condition in the graph.

Case_2: The program returns True because there is at least one neighbor of `node` whose `visited` status is True and `rec_stack` for that neighbor is also True, indicating a potential cycle in the graph.

Case_3: The program returns True indicating a valid evaluation of the neighbor neighbor[i + 1] from the graph at the specified node index.

Case_4: The program returns True indicating that the evaluation of the neighbor at index `i + 1` is successful, and the variable `node` is a valid index for `graph`, which contains at least one neighbor.

Case_5: The program returns True, indicating that the function executes successfully when `node` is a valid index for `graph`, which contains at least `i + 2` neighbors.

Case_6: The program returns True, indicating that the condition for the 'node' being a valid index for 'graph' and having at least 'i + 2' neighbors is satisfied.

Case_7: The program returns False, indicating that there are no cycles detected in the graph for the current node since all neighbors have been evaluated and did not lead to a cycle.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
