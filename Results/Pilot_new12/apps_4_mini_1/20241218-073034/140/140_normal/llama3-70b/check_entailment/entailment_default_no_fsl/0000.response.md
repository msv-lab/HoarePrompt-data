Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to detect cycles in a directed graph and immediately reports "NO" if any cycle is found. However, the problem states that the goal is to determine if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The program does not check for the possibility of breaking the cycle by removing a single edge. 

There are cases where a cycle exists, but it is possible to remove just one edge to render the graph acyclic. For instance, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```

This input forms a cycle involving all three vertices (1 → 2 → 3 → 1). According to the problem description, it is possible to remove either edge (1→2 or 3→1 or 2→3) to break the cycle and make the graph acyclic. Yet, the current program will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks for cycles without considering the possibility of removal.

For this reason, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the correctness of the program is false.
