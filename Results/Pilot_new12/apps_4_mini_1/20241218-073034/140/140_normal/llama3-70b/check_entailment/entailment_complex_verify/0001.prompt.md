You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, it uses only a cycle detection algorithm and wrongly concludes that if it finds a cycle, it cannot be made acyclic by removing just one edge, resulting in an answer of "NO."

A counterexample to illustrate the failure of the program is as follows:

Input:
```
3 3
1 2
1 3
2 1
```

In this case, the graph has a cycle (1 → 2 → 1). However, by removing the edge `2 → 1`, it would indeed become acyclic (1 → 2 and 1 → 3, with no cycles present). The expected output should thus be "YES."

The program fails to account for the possibility of breaking a cycle with a single edge removal, which leads to incorrect results for several graph configurations.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of lists where each sublist represents the directed edges from the corresponding vertex (1 ≤ node ≤ n), visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of boolean values indicating the recursion stack state for each vertex.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, all neighbors of `node` have been evaluated. If a neighbor has not been visited, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` has been called for that neighbor. If a neighbor has been visited, for each visited neighbor, `rec_stack[neighbor]` whether True or False reflects their inclusion in the recursion stack at some point during the exploration. Additionally, if any neighbor has led to a cycle, the function would have returned True.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no cycles detected in the graph for the current node since all neighbors have been evaluated and did not lead to a cycle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to detect cycles in a directed graph represented as a list of adjacency lists. It accepts four parameters: `node`, an integer representing the current vertex to explore; `graph`, a list of lists where each sublist contains directed edges from the corresponding vertex; `visited`, a list of boolean values indicating which vertices have been traversed; and `rec_stack`, a list of boolean values representing the vertices currently in the recursion stack. Upon execution, the function marks the current node as visited and adds it to the recursion stack. It then recursively examines each unvisited neighbor of the current node. If a visited neighbor is found which is also in the recursion stack, a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`. If all neighbors are explored without finding a cycle, the function marks the current node as not in the recursion stack and returns `False`. The overall functionality thus checks for cycles in the directed graph, providing a boolean output indicating the presence or absence of cycles. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases where the input `node` may be out of bounds, which could lead to index errors. Therefore, handling for such edge cases is a missing element in the current implementation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
