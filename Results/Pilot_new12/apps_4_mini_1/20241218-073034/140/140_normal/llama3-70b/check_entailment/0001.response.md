Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, it uses only a cycle detection algorithm and wrongly concludes that if it finds a cycle, it cannot be made acyclic by removing just one edge, resulting in an answer of "NO."

A counterexample to illustrate the failure of the program is as follows:

Input:
```
3 3
1 2
1 3
2 1
```

In this case, the graph has a cycle (1 → 2 → 1). However, by removing the edge `2 → 1`, it would indeed become acyclic (1 → 2 and 1 → 3, with no cycles present). The expected output should thus be "YES."

The program fails to account for the possibility of breaking a cycle with a single edge removal, which leads to incorrect results for several graph configurations.
