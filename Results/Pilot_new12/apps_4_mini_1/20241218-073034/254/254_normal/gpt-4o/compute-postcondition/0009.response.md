Functionality: **The function reads three integers k1, k2, and k3 from user input, checks the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers, and prints 'YES' if their GCD is 1 (indicating that the numbers are coprime), or 'NO' if their GCD is greater than 1. This process requires the input values to be within the range of 1 to 1500. The function does not return any value and its output is solely based on the GCD calculation.**
