The value of `gcd_all` is assigned the value of `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`, where `gcd_k1_k2` is already defined as `math.gcd(k1, k2)`. Given that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers between 1 and 1500, `gcd_all` will also be an integer that represents the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`. 

Other variables remain unchanged, and we note that `gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)` exists prior to this execution and is used as a parameter in the calculation. 

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is equal to `math.gcd(k1, k2)`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.**
