`gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the value of `math.gcd(k1, k2)`, which calculates the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`. The values of `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged, but `gcd_k1_k2` now holds the greatest common divisor of these two values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is equal to `math.gcd(k1, k2)`.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3; `gcd_k1_k2` is equal to `math.gcd(k1, k2)`.**
