Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to determine whether it's possible for Mishka to switch on three garlands such that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum switching time. However, the use of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to make this determination is incorrect.

To illustrate the failure, consider the input values `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`. The GCD of these values is `1`, leading the program to print "YES". However, in this scenario, if we switch on the garlands (for instance, at x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3 = 0), then:

- The first garland will be lit at seconds: 0, 4, 8, 12, ...
- The second garland will be lit at seconds: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
- The third garland will be lit at seconds: 0, 3, 6, 9, ...

From second 1, no garland is lit, meaning there are periods without any garland being lit. The program fails to cover this case, and thus incorrectly concludes it is possible. 

Therefore, since the program does not handle certain scenarios correctly, it is not fulfilling the requirements of the problem statement.
