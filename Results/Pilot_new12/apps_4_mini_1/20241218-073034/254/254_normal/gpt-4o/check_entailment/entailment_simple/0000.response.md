To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functionalities and the requirements laid out.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mishka needs to choose three moments in time to switch on three garlands, identified by their time intervals k1, k2, and k3. The objective is to ensure that at least one garland is lit during every subsequent second after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3. 

### Key Requirements:
- The garlands are switched on with intervals k1, k2, and k3.
- There should be at least one garland lit at every second starting from max(x1, x2, x3).

### Program Logic:
1. The program computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the three intervals (k1, k2, k3).
2. If the gcd is equal to 1, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of the Program's Logic:
- The key point in the problem description is ensuring that there's a lit garland during every second after the maximum of the chosen switching times.
- The program's logic implies that if the gcd of the intervals is 1, then it is theoretically possible to configure the moments of switching (x1, x2, x3) in such a way that there will always be coverage for every subsequent second.
- In contrast, if the gcd is greater than 1, then there will be at least one second after max(x1, x2, x3) during which no garland is lit because they will all light up in synchrony based on their gcd.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to effectively check if there's a way for Mishka to ensure at least one garland is lit during every second after their maximum switching time. This aligns correctly with the problem description since a gcd of 1 implies that the three intervals can cover every integer second going forward.

Thus, the program fulfills the requirement of the problem description effectively.

Correctness: **True**
