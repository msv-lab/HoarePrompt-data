The given program calculates the GCD of the three garland time intervals (k1, k2, k3) and determines if they are coprime. The problem description states that Mishka aims to have at least one garland lit during every second after he switches them on. For that to be possible, the time intervals must not share a common divisor greater than 1.

The output hints clarify that the program checks if the GCD of the three intervals is 1 (indicating that it's possible to find moments x1, x2, and x3 such that the garlands cover each second). If the GCD is greater than 1, it implies that there will be some seconds that are not covered by any lit garland.

The program handles some cases correctly, specifically:
1. For inputs that are coprime (like 2, 2, 3), it correctly outputs "YES".
2. For inputs that share a common divisor greater than 1 (like 4, 2, 3), it outputs "NO".

However, there are details in the problem description that the logic fails to accurately cover:
- The program relies solely on the GCD to determine the ability to cover every second after the maximum of the chosen intervals. However, periods with common factors (like all intervals being multiples of a number) could lead to unavoidable gaps in certain seconds, which is not explicitly addressed by just checking the GCD.

For example:
- With inputs of (6, 9, 12), while the GCD is 3, the output will be "NO". However, this does not necessarily guarantee that there would be intervals of time still fully lit. Testing needs to cover specific time instances rather than relying only on GCD.

Thus, the check for covering every second based on finding coprimes does not adequately ensure that the conditions outlined in the problem description are satisfied for all cases. The implementation does not consider the broader implications of intervals that are not solely determined by their GCD.

Correctness: **False**.
