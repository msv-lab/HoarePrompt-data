Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description correctly. The problem requires that all three garlands can be switched on at moments in time (x1, x2, x3) such that during each second after the maximum of those moments, at least one garland is lit. The program, however, only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals is equal to 1 to determine if they are coprime.

This fails to account for cases where garlands can light up the seconds collectively, even if they are not coprime. For example, consider the input:

```
3 3 3
```

In this case, the GCD is 3, and according to the program, the output would be 'NO'. However, it is possible to choose x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, leading the garlands to be lit at every third second (1, 2, 3, 4, ...), thus satisfying the condition that at least one garland will be lit at every second after the maximum of x1, x2, x3. 

Thus, since the program fails to correctly identify scenarios where the garlands would adequately cover the time periods required, it is incorrect.
