Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate as the program incorrectly concludes that it is possible for Mishka to switch on the garlands based solely on the GCD of the intervals. The problem requires ensuring that at least one garland is lit during every second after switching on, which the GCD evaluation does not guarantee. For example, in the case where `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`, the program will output "YES" incorrectly, as there will indeed be seconds where no garland is lit. The reliance on the GCD does not address the core requirement of the problem, thus rendering the program's logic faulty.
