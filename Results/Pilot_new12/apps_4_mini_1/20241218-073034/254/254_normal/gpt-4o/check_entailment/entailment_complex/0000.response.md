Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The key requirement of the problem is to ensure at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum of the three chosen starting times (`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`). 

The program checks whether the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three garland intervals (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`) is equal to 1 in order to print "YES". This logic is flawed. The GCD being 1 (i.e., the numbers are coprime) does not guarantee that the intervals can be arranged in such a way that every second is covered. 

For example, if `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, the GCD is 1, and the program would return "YES". However, if `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, the GCD is still 1, but intervals do not cover every second after a certain time, which contradicts the requirement.

In essence, the problem requires a different approach â€” a scheduling algorithm or coverage check across the integers rather than merely determining the GCD. Therefore, the method the program employs does not satisfy the requirements indicated in the problem description.
