Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The reasoning behind the conclusion states that the program's logic related to the calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) does not correctly fulfill the requirements set by the problem description. The provided code attempts to determine if there will be at least one garland lit during every second after selecting the maximum switch-on times, but the condition it checks (whether the LCM is divisible by the intervals of the garlands) fails to accurately represent the problem's needs.

The output hints, along with the analysis, confirm that the GCD calculation (via the function `func_1`) is correctly implemented, but the application of LCM to check for overlapping states does not guarantee continuous coverage. Therefore, even with valid intervals, there could be scenarios — such as with garland intervals of `6, 10, 15` — where the garlands might not overlap sufficiently, resulting in periods where no garland is lit.

This misalignment in the program's approach supports the original assessment's conclusion that it can lead to incorrect results under certain conditions. Hence, the final correctness of the program remains **False**.
