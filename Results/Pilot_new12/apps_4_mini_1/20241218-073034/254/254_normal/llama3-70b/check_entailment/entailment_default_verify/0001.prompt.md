You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to determine if it is possible to have at least one lit garland during each subsequent second after the maximum time that any garland is switched on. However, the logic used to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the garland intervals is flawed. 

The condition to check if the LCM is divisible by each interval does not accurately represent the requirements set by the problem statement. The problem requires that after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3, there must be at least one garland lit during every second. The current program could potentially miss scenarios where choosing the moments of time leads to gaps where no garlands are lit.

For example, if we provide the input `1 1 1`, the program will output `YES` because LCM calculations would show it satisfies the condition. However, for `1 1 1`, all garlands are lit every second, matching the intended requirement.

But if we input `5 5 5`, it should also return `YES` since all garlands will light up every 5 seconds, meaning that you can choose `x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1` and every 5 seconds all garlands will be on. However, if we test with `6 10 15`, it could lead to moments where intervals may not overlap, as there will be gaps before 30 seconds where no garland may be lit.

The LCM analysis misaligns with the actual periodic state of the garlands controlled by intervals; hence, the assertion is invalid, and the current logic presented will not handle all potential cases accurately, leading to incorrect results. This confirms that the program does not follow the problem description correctly in every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent time intervals of garlands. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. After the function execution, `b` becomes 0, while the value of `a` is replaced with the computed GCD. The function does not modify or use a third parameter, `c`, which remains unchanged throughout. The function handles all inputs where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500 and assumes both inputs are positive integers. If either input is zero (though the specification states 1 ≤ a, b), the GCD logic will yield results consistent with mathematical definitions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
