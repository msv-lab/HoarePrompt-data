You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mishka needs to choose three integers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) (not necessarily distinct) such that when he switches on three garlands with time intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \), at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \).

### Program Overview:
The code provided calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) using the function `func_1`, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD). Then, it checks whether this LCM is divisible by each \( k_i \).

### Logical Analysis:
For Mishka to succeed in ensuring that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum starting time, the LCM of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) must be computed correctly, as it indicates the periodicity at which all garlands will be lit together. The garlands need to cover every second effectively with their intervals. 

### Problem with the Code:
- The program incorrectly calculates the LCM by multiplying \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) before dividing by the GCDs. The formula used does not actually calculate the LCM correctly:
  
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
  
  The current implementation uses incorrect multiplication of the three GCDs, and moreover, as they are chained, isolates combinations incorrectly.

### Edge Case Testing:
1. **Case Example 1:** (1, 1, 1)
   - Expected Output: YES (since all seconds are covered)
   - The program will output YES since the lcm would be improperly calculated as 1, still satisfying the checks.

2. **Case Example 2:** (1, 2, 3)
   - Expected Output: YES (since all seconds are covered)
   - This case also would output YES due to incorrect calculations confirming the wrong conditions.

3. **Case Example 3:** (4, 6, 12)
   - Expected Output: YES (since the seconds can be easily covered)
   - This one would also incorrectly evaluate LCM, potentially leading to a NO instead of YES.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly determine situations where garlands will not light every possible second after max \( x_i \) due to incorrect calculation of the LCM. This could lead to misinterpretation of circumstances that could allow the garlands to effectively cover all seconds after turning on.

Given the analysis, there are indeed potential cases where the output contradicts the expected functionality described.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent time intervals of garlands. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. After the function execution, `b` becomes 0, while the value of `a` is replaced with the computed GCD. The function does not modify or use a third parameter, `c`, which remains unchanged throughout. The function handles all inputs where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500 and assumes both inputs are positive integers. If either input is zero (though the specification states 1 ≤ a, b), the GCD logic will yield results consistent with mathematical definitions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
