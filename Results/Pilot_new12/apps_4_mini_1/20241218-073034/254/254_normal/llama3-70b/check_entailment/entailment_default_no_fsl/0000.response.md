Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals of the garlands to determine if there is a suitable time to switch them on. However, the implementation of the logic for determining whether it is possible for at least one garland to be lit during every second starting from the maximum of the x's is flawed.

### Issues:
1. The LCM calculation appears to be incorrect due to the incorrect approach of multiplying by the GCD. The LCM of multiple numbers should be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
   \]
   Extending this to three numbers should be:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3) = \frac{\text{lcm}(\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2), k_3)}
   \]

2. The condition for determining if all garlands can cover every second after the maximum of the chosen x's relies solely on checking if `lcm % k1`, `lcm % k2`, and `lcm % k3` are zero. This does not capture the requirement correctly, as it does not consider whether there are gaps in the intervals that can be lit.

### Example Case:
To demonstrate the flaw, consider the input `1 1 2`:
- Here, `k1 = 1`, `k2 = 1`, `k3 = 2`.
- The program calculates the LCM of these intervals, which results in `2`.
- It checks `lcm % k1 == 0`, `lcm % k2 == 0`, and `lcm % k3 == 0`, which are all fulfilled (`2 % 1 == 0`, `2 % 1 == 0`, and `2 % 2 == 0`), hence the output would be "YES". 

However, we can switch on the garlands at:
- The first two garlands at `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 1`, and third at `x3 = 2`:
  - The first two garlands will be lit at every second, while the last one adds to the coverage but is not necessary.
  
Now consider the input `4 2 3`:
- The logic in the code states "NO" correctly, but the program could be susceptible to incorrect calculations of the LCM and hence could fail in cases that aren't straightforward.

Overall, the approach does not align properly with the requirements to ensure there are no "gaps" where no garland is lit after switching them on. Thus, for at least one potential case, the program does not provide the correct result. 

Therefore, since the program is not reliable for every potential input case according to the problem description, the correctness is marked as false.
