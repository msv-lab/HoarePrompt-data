Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to determine if it is possible to have at least one lit garland during each subsequent second after the maximum time that any garland is switched on. However, the logic used to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the garland intervals is flawed. 

The condition to check if the LCM is divisible by each interval does not accurately represent the requirements set by the problem statement. The problem requires that after the maximum of x1, x2, and x3, there must be at least one garland lit during every second. The current program could potentially miss scenarios where choosing the moments of time leads to gaps where no garlands are lit.

For example, if we provide the input `1 1 1`, the program will output `YES` because LCM calculations would show it satisfies the condition. However, for `1 1 1`, all garlands are lit every second, matching the intended requirement.

But if we input `5 5 5`, it should also return `YES` since all garlands will light up every 5 seconds, meaning that you can choose `x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1` and every 5 seconds all garlands will be on. However, if we test with `6 10 15`, it could lead to moments where intervals may not overlap, as there will be gaps before 30 seconds where no garland may be lit.

The LCM analysis misaligns with the actual periodic state of the garlands controlled by intervals; hence, the assertion is invalid, and the current logic presented will not handle all potential cases accurately, leading to incorrect results. This confirms that the program does not follow the problem description correctly in every potential case.
