To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and its implementation in the context of the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mishka has three garlands defined by their time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \). The goal is to determine whether it is possible to find integers \( x_1, x_2, \) and \( x_3 \) such that each second after the maximum of these values, at least one garland will be lit.

### Key Points for Verification:
1. **Understanding the Lighting Pattern**:
   - A garland \( i \) with interval \( k_i \) lights up at seconds \( x, x + k_i, x + 2k_i, \ldots \). Therefore, by choosing different \( x_i \), we can control when each garland lights up.
   
2. **Concept of LCM (Least Common Multiple)**:
   - To ensure that all seconds are covered post the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \), at least one garland must light up at every second. A good condition for this is that their LCM should be found. If the LCM of the three intervals is such that each garland lights up every LCM/k intervals, we can find non-overlapping times \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) where all seconds are eventually covered.

3. **GCD and Its Usage**:
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to compute the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the garland intervals. This calculation is relevant here because the LCM can be computed using the relationship between GCD and LCM: 
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]

### Examination of the Program Logic:
- The program reads input values \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \).
- It calculates the LCM incorrectly; it attempts to compute it directly using a formula that doesn’t accurately represent the LCM across three numbers. The formula provided for LCM in the code is flawed.
- It checks if all intervals divide the LCM evenly. This implies that the garlands can be activated in a way that covers all subsequent seconds.

### Point of Failure:
The logic to calculate the overall LCM using the method of pairs and GCD appears flawed because:
- The formula used for calculating LCM in the program doesn't correctly handle the LCM across three values; hence it can give incorrect results based on different intervals.
- The choice to print ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ strictly based on modulus checks of the LCM doesn't ensure that at least one garland is lit at every second.

### Conclusion:
The program attempts to solve the problem, but the way it calculates the LCM does not always align with ensuring coverage for every second after the provided intervals. Certain combinations of \( (k_1, k_2, k_3) \) where intervals are not adequately coprime can lead to a scenario where it fails to ensure at least one garland lights up every second.

Thus, given that the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
