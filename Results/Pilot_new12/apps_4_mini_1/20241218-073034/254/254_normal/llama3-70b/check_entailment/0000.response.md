To evaluate the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mishka needs to choose three integers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) (not necessarily distinct) such that when he switches on three garlands with time intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \), at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \).

### Program Overview:
The code provided calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) using the function `func_1`, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD). Then, it checks whether this LCM is divisible by each \( k_i \).

### Logical Analysis:
For Mishka to succeed in ensuring that at least one garland is lit during every second after the maximum starting time, the LCM of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) must be computed correctly, as it indicates the periodicity at which all garlands will be lit together. The garlands need to cover every second effectively with their intervals. 

### Problem with the Code:
- The program incorrectly calculates the LCM by multiplying \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) before dividing by the GCDs. The formula used does not actually calculate the LCM correctly:
  
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
  
  The current implementation uses incorrect multiplication of the three GCDs, and moreover, as they are chained, isolates combinations incorrectly.

### Edge Case Testing:
1. **Case Example 1:** (1, 1, 1)
   - Expected Output: YES (since all seconds are covered)
   - The program will output YES since the lcm would be improperly calculated as 1, still satisfying the checks.

2. **Case Example 2:** (1, 2, 3)
   - Expected Output: YES (since all seconds are covered)
   - This case also would output YES due to incorrect calculations confirming the wrong conditions.

3. **Case Example 3:** (4, 6, 12)
   - Expected Output: YES (since the seconds can be easily covered)
   - This one would also incorrectly evaluate LCM, potentially leading to a NO instead of YES.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly determine situations where garlands will not light every possible second after max \( x_i \) due to incorrect calculation of the LCM. This could lead to misinterpretation of circumstances that could allow the garlands to effectively cover all seconds after turning on.

Given the analysis, there are indeed potential cases where the output contradicts the expected functionality described.

Correctness: **False**.
