The value of `a` is updated to the current value of `b`, and the value of `b` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). Since initially `a` must be greater than `b` and `b` must be greater than 0, after the execution, `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` becomes the result of `a % b`, which will be less than `b` because `a` is greater than `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to `b`, `b` must still be greater than 0, and `b` is less than the previous value of `b` since `a % b` will be positive and less than `b`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `b`; `b` must be greater than 0; `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`, which is less than the previous value of `b`.**
