The variable `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The initial conditions state that `b` must be greater than 0. The values of `a` and `c` may vary, but now `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, and `b` is changed according to the modulus operation involving `a`. 

The new state will show that `b` is the result of `a % b`, and `a` takes on the previous value of `b`. 

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to `a % b`, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer**.
