Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent time intervals of garlands. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. After the function execution, `b` becomes 0, while the value of `a` is replaced with the computed GCD. The function does not modify or use a third parameter, `c`, which remains unchanged throughout. The function handles all inputs where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500 and assumes both inputs are positive integers. If either input is zero (though the specification states 1 ≤ a, b), the GCD logic will yield results consistent with mathematical definitions.**
