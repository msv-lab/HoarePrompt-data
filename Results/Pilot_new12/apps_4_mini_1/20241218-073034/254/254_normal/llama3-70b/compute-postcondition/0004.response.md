According to the code, the condition for the loop to execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `b` was set to the previous value of `a % b`, and it is given that `b` must be greater than 0. However, we also know that `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `a` should not only be currently equal to the previous value of `b`, but the previous operation of `b` (which is `a % b`) must also result in a non-zero value.

Given that `b` must remain greater than 0, we don't need to make any adjustments to `a`, as its value already satisfies the condition of being equal to the previous `b`. However, we need to ensure that after the assignment `b = a % b`, this must result in `b` being greater than 0.

Thus, `a` must be greater than `b` for `a % b` to be non-zero. We can express this conditionally for `a`.

State: **`a` must be greater than `b`; `b` must be greater than 0**
