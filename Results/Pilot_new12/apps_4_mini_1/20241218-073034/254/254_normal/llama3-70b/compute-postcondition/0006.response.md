To analyze the output state after the while loop executes, let's break down the effects of the loop step by step.

1. **Initial state**: Given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1500\), we know that both `a` and `b` are initially positive.

2. The loop continues executing as long as `b` is not zero.

3. The operations inside the loop are effectively swapping the values of `a` and `b`, and computing `a % b`. 

4. **After execution of the loop**:
   - When `b` reaches 0, the loop will terminate. At this point, the value of `a` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` since the algorithm implements the Euclidean algorithm.
   - Since `b` must be positive for the loop to execute, we can determine that `b` will eventually reach 0 after a certain number of iterations.

### Output State Analysis by Execution Times:

- **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**: 
  - `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, 
  - `b` is now `a % b`, 
  - initial `b` must be greater than 0,
  - `c` is an integer.

- **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**:
  - `a` is now the new value of `b` (from the previous iteration),
  - `b` is now `a % b` (from the previous iteration),
  - `b` must still be greater than 0.

- **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: 
  - `a` is still equivalent to the value of `b`,
  - `b` is again derived from the previous execution and must remain greater than 0,
  - `b` has now gotten smaller as it represents the result of a modulus operation.

Ultimately, after repeated executions, the loop will stop when `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` will represent the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, while `b` will be 0.

The final output state, therefore, would be:
- `a` has the value equal to the GCD of original `a` and `b`,
- `b` is 0.

This leads us to the final conclusion.

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` remains unchanged.**
