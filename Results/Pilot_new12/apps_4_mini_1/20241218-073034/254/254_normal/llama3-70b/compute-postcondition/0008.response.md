The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing time intervals of garlands, with constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. After executing the function body, the program returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0, and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return their GCD while considering the condition of `b` being 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, and returns the GCD of a and b with b being 0 while a remains unchanged.**
