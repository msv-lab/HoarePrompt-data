The statement `a, b = b, a % b` results in a tuple assignment, where `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given the initial conditions that `b` must be greater than 0 and `a` must be greater than or equal to `b`, we can analyze this step by step.

- The value of `b` is assigned to `a`, which was previously the value of `b`.
- The value of `b` now becomes the result of `a % b`. Since `a` was previously greater than or equal to `b`, and now `b` takes on the value of `a % b`, it will be less than `b` and greater than or equal to 0. 

After these updates,
- `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`.
- `b` is now equal to `previous a % previous b`.

Thus, the output state retains the information about the values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the previous value of `b`; `b` is equal to the previous value of `a % b`, and `b` must be greater than 0.**
