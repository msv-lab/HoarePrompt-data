According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is a non-zero integer. Right before the loop, `b` is stated to be an integer, but it is not specified whether `b` is greater than 0 or not. For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be greater than 0. 

Since there's no other information about the values of `a` and `c`, we do not need to adjust them. 

State: **a is an integer, b must be greater than 0, c is an integer**
