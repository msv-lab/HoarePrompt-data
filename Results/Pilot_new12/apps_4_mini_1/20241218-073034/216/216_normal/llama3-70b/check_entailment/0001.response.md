To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and compare it to the requirements.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in the string while ensuring that there are no uppercase letters between any of the positions of these letters.

The program extracts the indices of all lowercase letters but does not check:
1. If those lowercase letters are distinct.
2. If there are any uppercase letters between the lowercase letters being considered.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aAbcA
```
- The lowercase letters are `['a', 'b', 'c']` from the `aAbcA`, placed at positions 0, 2, and 3.
- However, from position 0 (where 'a' is) to 2 (where 'b' is), there is an uppercase 'A' at position 1, which violates the condition set by the problem.
- According to the problem, the maximum number of pretty set positions should be `2` (positions 2 and 3 for letters 'b' and 'c' respectively).

However, the program would simply return `3`, counting 'a', 'b', and 'c' without any checks for the conditions regarding uppercase letters in between.

Thus, we can conclude that the program does not adequately filter the positions based on the rules specified in the description. 

Correctness: **False**
