To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program and evaluate it against various potential cases.

The problem requires determining the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters from the string while ensuring there are no uppercase letters separating these lowercase letters in the chosen indices. 

The provided program only collects the indices of all lowercase letters:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
```

**Key Observations:**

1. The program collects all indices of the lowercase letters without considering the condition that there shouldn't be any uppercase letters between them. Therefore, it simply counts all occurrences of lowercase letters but does not verify if they can actually form a "pretty" set according to the problem definition.
  
2. The output of the program is the total count of lowercase letters, which can be misleading. It does not take into account the distinctiveness of the lowercase letters nor the intervening uppercase letters.

**Counter-examples:**

To demonstrate why this logic is incorrect, consider the following string with an uppercase letter intervening lowercase letters:

- **Input:** 
```
6
aAbcde
```

In this case, the pretty set should be {2, 3, 4}, meaning we can have 'b', 'c', and 'd' since 'A' separates 'a' from the rest, meaning only one distinct lowercase letter ('a' from position 0) can be considered, thus the maximum number of elements in a pretty set is **3**.

However, using the program, the output will be:
```
4
```
Which is incorrect because it counts 'a' twice but does not consider them distinct (also it allows counting letters separated by uppercase letters).

Similarly, in this case:
- **Input:**
```
8
aBcAbcdE
```
The valid positions should only give us letters 'a' from position 0, 'a' from position 3, 'b' from position 4 and 'c' from position 5. Though letters 'a', 'b', 'c' are lowercase, we cannot consider 'A' as it does not allow candidates from 0 to 2 or 3 to any.

Since the program simply counts all lowercase letters, it misses the crucial logic needed to determine if selected letters can form a "pretty" set.

**Conclusion:**

Given the identified flaw in the logic of the program, it is evident that the provided program does not meet the requirements stipulated in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**.
