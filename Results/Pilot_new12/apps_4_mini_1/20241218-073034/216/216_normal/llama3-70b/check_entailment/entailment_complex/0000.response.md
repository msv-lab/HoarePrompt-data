The provided program does not meet the requirements according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

1. **Problem Requirements**: 
   The goal is to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be selected from string `s` such that there are no uppercase letters between the selected positions. 

2. **Program Functionality**: 
   - The program collects the indices of all lowercase letters in the string `s` using a list comprehension: 
     ```python
     lowercase = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
     ```
   - It then prints the length of this list, which simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string.

3. **Mismatch**:
   - The program does not account for the condition of choosing lowercase letters that are not separated by uppercase letters. It fails to implement logic that would ensure that selected lowercase letters are distinct and grouped without being interrupted by uppercase letters.
   - The output would not reflect the maximum set of valid pretty positions as specified in the problem description. For example, the program would return the total count of lowercase letters, ignoring whether they are separated by uppercase letters, which violates the conditions provided in the problem statement.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
