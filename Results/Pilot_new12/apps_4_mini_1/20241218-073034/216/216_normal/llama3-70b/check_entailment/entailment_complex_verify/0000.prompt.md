You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program and evaluate it against various potential cases.

The problem requires determining the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters from the string while ensuring there are no uppercase letters separating these lowercase letters in the chosen indices. 

The provided program only collects the indices of all lowercase letters:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
```

**Key Observations:**

1. The program collects all indices of the lowercase letters without considering the condition that there shouldn't be any uppercase letters between them. Therefore, it simply counts all occurrences of lowercase letters but does not verify if they can actually form a "pretty" set according to the problem definition.
  
2. The output of the program is the total count of lowercase letters, which can be misleading. It does not take into account the distinctiveness of the lowercase letters nor the intervening uppercase letters.

**Counter-examples:**

To demonstrate why this logic is incorrect, consider the following string with an uppercase letter intervening lowercase letters:

- **Input:** 
```
6
aAbcde
```

In this case, the pretty set should be {2, 3, 4}, meaning we can have 'b', 'c', and 'd' since 'A' separates 'a' from the rest, meaning only one distinct lowercase letter ('a' from position 0) can be considered, thus the maximum number of elements in a pretty set is **3**.

However, using the program, the output will be:
```
4
```
Which is incorrect because it counts 'a' twice but does not consider them distinct (also it allows counting letters separated by uppercase letters).

Similarly, in this case:
- **Input:**
```
8
aBcAbcdE
```
The valid positions should only give us letters 'a' from position 0, 'a' from position 3, 'b' from position 4 and 'c' from position 5. Though letters 'a', 'b', 'c' are lowercase, we cannot consider 'A' as it does not allow candidates from 0 to 2 or 3 to any.

Since the program simply counts all lowercase letters, it misses the crucial logic needed to determine if selected letters can form a "pretty" set.

**Conclusion:**

Given the identified flaw in the logic of the program, it is evident that the provided program does not meet the requirements stipulated in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and s is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length exactly n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two inputs: a positive integer `n`, which must be between 1 and 200 inclusive, and a string `s` whose length is exactly `n`. It counts the number of lowercase letters in the string `s` and prints that count. The function does not handle cases where `s` is not strictly `n` characters long or where `n` is outside the specified bounds, though such inputs are assumed to be valid based on the given preconditions. The final state of the program is that it outputs the count of lowercase letters found in the input string `s`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
