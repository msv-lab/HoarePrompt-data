The code creates a list `lowercase` that contains the indices of the characters in the string `s` that are lowercase. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is simply used to represent the length of `s`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `lowercase` based on the input string `s`, while retaining the other variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200; `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length exactly `n`; `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase letters in `s`.**
