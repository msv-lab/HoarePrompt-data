The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. Given that the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \), the program will replace the current value of `n` with a new positive integer input value that still adheres to this condition. The variable `s` remains unaffected.
  
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is the new input value between 1 and 200; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with length exactly `n`.**
