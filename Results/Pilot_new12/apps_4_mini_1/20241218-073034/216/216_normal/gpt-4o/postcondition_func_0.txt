The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` consisting solely of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It analyzes `s` to determine the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters found within consecutive segments that contain only lowercase letters. If an uppercase letter is encountered, it resets the count of the distinct lowercase letters. The final output is the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters from any such segment, printed as a single integer. The function does not handle cases where `s` might be empty; however, based on the constraints, it is assumed that `n` will always be at least 1. If `s` consists entirely of uppercase letters, the output will be 0, as no lowercase letters would be counted.
