You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and identify any edge cases where it might fail based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the length of the string, and then reads the string `s`.
   
2. **Set and Counting Logic**:
   - It initializes `current_set` to keep track of distinct lowercase letters between uppercase letters and `current_count` to count the size of this set.
   - As it processes each character in the string:
     - If a character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds it and increments `current_count`.
     - If a character is uppercase, it compares `current_count` to `max_count` and updates `max_count` if necessary. It then clears `current_set` and resets `current_count`.
   - At the end of the loop, it checks `current_count` again against `max_count` to account for lowercase letters that may appear after the last uppercase letter.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints `max_count`, which should represent the size of the largest "pretty" set of positions.

### Potential Edge Cases

Let's consider some cases that may not be handled correctly:

1. **All Uppercase**: If the string contains no lowercase letters (like "AAA"), the answer should be 0, which is correctly handled as `current_count` remains 0.

2. **Mixed Lowercase with Uppercase**: 
   - Input like "aBcDeF" should yield 3 (considering positions 0, 2, and 4).
   - Currently implemented logic might not consider sets across multiple uppercase letters since it resets on every uppercase character.

3. **Repeated Characters**: In cases where multiple lowercase letters are repeated and separated by uppercase letters, the logic may miss counting them correctly. For example, input "aAbAcB" should yield 2 (positions 0 and 4), but the program might just count the "a".

### Problematic Input Example

To identify a specific failure case:
- Input: `"aAbAbA"`
  - Here, if you expect the largest pretty set to consist of distinct lowercase letters across the pattern, it looks like there can be at least two 'a's counted.
  - However, due to the current implementation, `max_count` might not carry forward correctly because it resets after each 'B'.

### Conclusion

The logic currently implemented fails to consider combinations of lowercases separated by uppercases effectively, especially when they're repeated. The function does not accurately compute the maximum number based on the "pretty" definition.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` consisting solely of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It analyzes `s` to determine the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters found within consecutive segments that contain only lowercase letters. If an uppercase letter is encountered, it resets the count of the distinct lowercase letters. The final output is the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters from any such segment, printed as a single integer. The function does not handle cases where `s` might be empty; however, based on the constraints, it is assumed that `n` will always be at least 1. If `s` consists entirely of uppercase letters, the output will be 0, as no lowercase letters would be counted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
