You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles various inputs and whether it properly fulfills the criteria laid out in the prompt.

Here’s a recap of the conditions from the problem description:

1. We want a "pretty" set of positions in a string that contains only distinct lowercase letters.
2. There should be no uppercase letters between these positions.

Now let’s break down the program:

- It initializes `max_count` to keep track of the maximum size of the pretty set.
- `current_set` is used to maintain distinct lowercase letters for the current segment of the string between uppercase letters.
- `current_count` counts the distinct lowercase letters in the current segment.
- As we iterate through the string, when we encounter a lowercase letter, it’s added to `current_set` if it isn’t already present, and `current_count` is incremented.
- Upon encountering an uppercase letter, it checks if the `current_count` is greater than `max_count`, updates `max_count` if necessary, clears the `current_set`, and resets the `current_count` to zero.
- After finishing the loop, it checks again to potentially update `max_count` if the last segment of the string was lowercase.

Now let's analyze a scenario where the program could fail:

Consider the input `"abcAbcCab"`. 

1. The first segment is "abc" (all lowercase and distinct) which contributes 3 to the count.
2. The program sees 'A', so it saves `max_count` as 3, clears the set, and counts will reset.
3. The next segment will be "bc" (again distinct) after the next uppercase 'C', which will contribute another 2.
4. Finally, after the last 'b', the function will not consider 'C' should actually be counted as it interrupts a new calculation.

Here's the surprising edge case when parsing this correctly:

The string `abcAabcB` would yield a maximum count of 3 for the first segment "abc" but as 'A' interrupts 'l'. 

However, the code does not correctly identify that after 'B', it adds 'a', 'b' a second segment that can yield maximum count of another additional.

Thus:

Correctness: **False**. 

This program does not correctly keep track of maximum count across separate segments divided by uppercase letters.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, representing the length of string s; s is a string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `max_count` is the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters encountered in consecutive lowercase segments of `s`, `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0 if `s` was empty or ended with an uppercase letter. If `s` consists only of lowercase letters, `current_set` contains all distinct lowercase letters in `s`, and `current_count` is equal to the number of distinct lowercase letters.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` consisting solely of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It analyzes `s` to determine the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters found within consecutive segments that contain only lowercase letters. If an uppercase letter is encountered, it resets the count of the distinct lowercase letters. The final output is the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters from any such segment, printed as a single integer. The function does not handle cases where `s` might be empty; however, based on the constraints, it is assumed that `n` will always be at least 1. If `s` consists entirely of uppercase letters, the output will be 0, as no lowercase letters would be counted.
