The code snippet adds the `char` value to the `current_set`. The initial state of `char` is a lowercase letter that is not currently in the set. After the execution, `current_set` will include the `char`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 1 character, `char` is the first character of `s` and is a lowercase letter, and `char` is now in `current_set`.**
