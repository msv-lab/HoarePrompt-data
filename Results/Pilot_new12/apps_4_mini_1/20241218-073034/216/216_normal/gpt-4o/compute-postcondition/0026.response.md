`current_count` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` now includes `char`, `current_count` is increased by 1, `max_count` remains unchanged.
