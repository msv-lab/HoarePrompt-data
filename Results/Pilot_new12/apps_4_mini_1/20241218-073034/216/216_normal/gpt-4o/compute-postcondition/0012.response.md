The code assigns `max_count` the maximum value between its current value and `current_count`. Since the initial values of `max_count` and `current_count` are not specified, we cannot determine their specific values or their relationship. However, it can be inferred that `max_count` will either remain unchanged if `current_count` is less than or equal to `max_count`, or it will be updated to `current_count` if `current_count` is greater than `max_count`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is not a lowercase letter, and `max_count` is updated to the value of max(`max_count`, `current_count`).**
