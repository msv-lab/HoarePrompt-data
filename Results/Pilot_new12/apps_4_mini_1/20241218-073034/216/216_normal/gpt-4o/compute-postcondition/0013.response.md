The code `current_set.clear()` empties the `current_set`, but does not affect any other variables. The states of the other variables remain consistent with their initial conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` is updated to the value of max(`max_count`, `current_count`), `current_set` is empty**.
