The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `current_count` was previously updated based on the first character, but the specifics of that value are unknown. The states of `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, and `max_count` are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` includes `char` along with possibly other characters, `current_count` is updated to `previous value of current_count + 1`, and `max_count` remains the same.**
