The `current_set.clear()` method is called, which removes all elements from the `current_set`. The values of other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state conditions. Therefore, the output state updates only the `current_set` to indicate that it is now empty.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` is now empty, `current_count` is updated based on the first character, and `max_count` is max(max_count, current_count)**
