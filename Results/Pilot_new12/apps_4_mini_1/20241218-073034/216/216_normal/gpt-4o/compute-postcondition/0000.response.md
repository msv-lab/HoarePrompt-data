The value of `n` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, which means it is replaced by whatever positive integer is provided as input during execution. The previous constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) remain valid after the assignment. The string `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, and `n` is an input integer.**
