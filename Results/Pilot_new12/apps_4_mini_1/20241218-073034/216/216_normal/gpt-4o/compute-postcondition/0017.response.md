The statement `current_set.add(char)` modifies `current_set` by adding the character `char` to it. The variable `char` is defined as the second character of the string `s`, which has at least 2 characters. The initial state regarding the values of the other variables does not change due to this operation.

After executing the code:
- The character `char`, which is the second character of `s`, is added to the `current_set`.
- There is no change to `n`, `s`, `current_count`, or `max_count` with this operation.

Thus, the output state will include the original conditions and specify that `char` is added to `current_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` includes `char` along with possibly other characters, `current_count` is updated based on the first character, and `max_count` is updated if the first character was not a lowercase letter.**
