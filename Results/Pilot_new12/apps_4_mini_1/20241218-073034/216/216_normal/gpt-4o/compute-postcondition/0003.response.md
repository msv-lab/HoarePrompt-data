The code initializes `current_set` as an empty set. This does not affect the preexisting values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State retains the previous conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200; `s` is an input string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set.**
