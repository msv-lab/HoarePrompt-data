The method `current_set.clear()` removes all elements from `current_set`, leaving it empty. The other variables remain unchanged as indicated. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `current_set`, while confirming that the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` is the maximum of `current_count` and the previous `max_count`.**
