Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 3 characters, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, then `current_set` includes `char` and `current_count` is increased by 1 if `char` was not already present in `current_set`, while `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` is empty, `current_count` remains unchanged, and `max_count` is updated to be the maximum of `current_count` and the previous `max_count`.***
