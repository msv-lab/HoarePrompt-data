Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, and if `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char` along with possibly other characters, `current_count` is updated to the previous value of `current_count + 1`, and `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is in `current_set`, there is no change to `current_set`, `current_count`, or `max_count`.***
