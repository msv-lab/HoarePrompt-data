The value of `current_count` is assigned to 0, but since `current_count` remains unchanged according to the initial state, it will still retain its previous value. No other variables are affected. Thus, the output state will reflect that `current_count` remains the same, while the other conditions hold true.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` is the maximum of `current_count` and the previous `max_count`.**
