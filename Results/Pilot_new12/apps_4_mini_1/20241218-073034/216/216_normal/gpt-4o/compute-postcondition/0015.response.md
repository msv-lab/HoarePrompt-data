Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 1 character, and `char` is the first character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter, it is added to `current_set` (if not already present), and `current_count` is incremented by 1. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `max_count` is updated to the maximum of `max_count` and `current_count`, `current_set` is reset to empty, and `current_count` is set to 0.***
