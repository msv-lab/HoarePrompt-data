The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The variable `current_count` was previously unknown, and only its updated value is affected; thus, it now holds a value that is one greater than its previous state. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200; `s` has at least 1 character; `char` is the first character of `s` and is a lowercase letter; `char` is now in `current_set`; `current_count` is incremented by 1.
