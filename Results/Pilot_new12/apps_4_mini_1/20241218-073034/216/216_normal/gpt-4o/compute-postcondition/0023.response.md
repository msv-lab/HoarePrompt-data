Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `char` is the second character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not already in `current_set`, then `current_set` includes `char`, `current_count` is updated to the previous value of `current_count + 1`, and `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is a lowercase letter and is in `current_set`, there are no changes to `current_set`, `current_count`, or `max_count`. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `current_set` is emptied, `current_count` is set to 0, and `max_count` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `current_count`.***
