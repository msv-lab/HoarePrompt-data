The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200, representing the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists solely of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function performs some operation involving the string `s` but no specific output conditions are given in the prompt, hence we cannot ascertain the return value based on what is provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string s consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.**
