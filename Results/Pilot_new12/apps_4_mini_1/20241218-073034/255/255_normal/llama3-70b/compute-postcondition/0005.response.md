The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value. Since `ans` was initially 1, after the increment, its new value will be 2. Other variables remain unaffected, and since the conditions provided in the initial state remain valid, the output will include those unchanged values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of `s`.**
