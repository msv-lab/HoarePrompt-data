The code `print(ans)` simply outputs the value of `ans`. There are no changes made to the variables `n`, `s`, or `ans`. The variable `ans` holds the value representing the number of distinct adjacent character groups in the string `s`. 

Since no calculations or assignments are performed, the output state only reflects the existing information. Therefore, we maintain the initial state for all variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `ans` is the number of distinct adjacent character groups in `s`.**
