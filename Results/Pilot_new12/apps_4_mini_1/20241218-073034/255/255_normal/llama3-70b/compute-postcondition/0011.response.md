The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact value after the increment. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
