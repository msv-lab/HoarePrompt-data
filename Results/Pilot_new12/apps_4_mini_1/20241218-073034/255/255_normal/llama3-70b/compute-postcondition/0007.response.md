According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the index `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 2. To ensure that the loop can continue, `n` must be at least 3, allowing `i` to be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 2, `i` is 2**
