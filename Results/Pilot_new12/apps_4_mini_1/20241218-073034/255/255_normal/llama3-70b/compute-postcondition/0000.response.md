`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which will take an integer input and convert it to an integer. The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is a positive integer within the range 1 to 500. The variable `s` remains unchanged, as it is independent of this operation. Thus, the output state can be represented as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, and `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `n` is an input integer.**
