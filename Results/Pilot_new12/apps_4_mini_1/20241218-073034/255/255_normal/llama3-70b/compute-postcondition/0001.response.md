The variable `s` is assigned the value obtained from `input()`, which is a string that must consist of lowercase Latin letters and has a length of `n`. The previous values of `n` remain unchanged, as `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500. The output will include that `s` is now a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase letters provided via input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters from input.**
