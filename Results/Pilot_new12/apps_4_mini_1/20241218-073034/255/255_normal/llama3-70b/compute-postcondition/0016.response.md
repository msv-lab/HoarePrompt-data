Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters from user input. It calculates and prints the number of distinct adjacent character groups in the string `s`. Each group is formed by consecutive identical characters. For instance, in the string "aaabbc", there are three groups: "aaa", "bb", and "c". The function does not accept parameters or return a value directly. It assumes valid input based on the given constraints but does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid input or empty strings.**
