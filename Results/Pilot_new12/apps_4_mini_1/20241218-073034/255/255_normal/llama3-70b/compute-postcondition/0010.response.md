According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to `n-1`. The iteration variable `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase to 3, and `s[i]` will have to be accessed at that new index. Since `n` is at least 3, `s[i]` will be valid at index 3.

Thus, the new conditions are:
- `i` should be 3 to execute the loop once more.
- The string `s` must be such that its length (`n`) is at least 4 to access `s[3]`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3**
