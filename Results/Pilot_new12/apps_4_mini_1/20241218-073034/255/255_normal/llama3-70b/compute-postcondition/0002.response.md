`ans` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `ans` is 1**.
