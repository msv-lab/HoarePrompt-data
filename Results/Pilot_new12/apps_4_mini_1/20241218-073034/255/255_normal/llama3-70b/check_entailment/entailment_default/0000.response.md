The provided program aims to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings of equal letters. However, the algorithm incorrectly counts the distinct groups of adjacent characters instead of groups that can be removed with a single operation, meaning it does not calculate the minimum number of operations needed to clear the string according to the problem description.

### Analysis:
1. The function initializes a counter `ans` to 1, assuming at least one operation is needed.
2. It increments `ans` for every time it finds a character that is different from the previous character (i.e., it counts distinct groups of adjacent characters).
3. This logic does not represent the number of deletions required to remove the whole string effectively. For example:
   - For input `s = "aaaaa"`, the function will output `1` whereas we can delete it in one operation, which is correct.
   - However, for `s = "abaca"`, the function will output `3` (groups: "a", "b", "a", "c", "a") but we could delete this string in `3` operations if we delete "aaa" first, then "b" and "c". This seems correct. 
   - For `s = "abcddcba"`, the program will output `8` because it counts every distinct character separately even though you could actually perform fewer operations by removing contiguous characters.

### Conclusion:
The program fundamentally misunderstands how to calculate the minimum operations since it does not account for replacing larger contiguous segments of identical characters. Therefore, it incorrectly yields results for cases where segments can be combined.

Given this reasoning, we conclude that the code does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**.
