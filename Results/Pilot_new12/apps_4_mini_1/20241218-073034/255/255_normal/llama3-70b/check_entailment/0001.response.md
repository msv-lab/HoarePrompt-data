Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the whole string according to the problem description. The logic implemented in the program simply counts the number of contiguous segments of different characters, which does not accurately represent the minimal operations required to delete the entire string. 

For instance:

- Consider the input:
```
5
aaaaa
```
The output should be `1` because the whole string can be deleted in one operation since all characters are the same.

- However, with the provided program, the output would be `1` as well, which is correct in this specific example. 

Now consider the input:
```
6
aaabbb
```
The expected output should be `2`. You can delete "aaa" in one operation and "bbb" in another.

However, the program, when tested for this case, will also output `2`, which works. 

To find an edge case where this fails:
- For the input:
```
10
aaabaaaabb
```
Expected output would be `3` (delete "aaa", then "a", then "b"). 

The program will output `5`, counting each change. 

Thus, the logic the program uses does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations for all input cases according to the problem's requirement. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of **False**.
