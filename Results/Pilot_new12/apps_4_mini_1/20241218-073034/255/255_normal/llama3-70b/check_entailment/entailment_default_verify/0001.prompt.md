You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to delete the whole string according to the problem description. The logic implemented in the program simply counts the number of contiguous segments of different characters, which does not accurately represent the minimal operations required to delete the entire string. 

For instance:

- Consider the input:
```
5
aaaaa
```
The output should be `1` because the whole string can be deleted in one operation since all characters are the same.

- However, with the provided program, the output would be `1` as well, which is correct in this specific example. 

Now consider the input:
```
6
aaabbb
```
The expected output should be `2`. You can delete "aaa" in one operation and "bbb" in another.

However, the program, when tested for this case, will also output `2`, which works. 

To find an edge case where this fails:
- For the input:
```
10
aaabaaaabb
```
Expected output would be `3` (delete "aaa", then "a", then "b"). 

The program will output `5`, counting each change. 

Thus, the logic the program uses does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations for all input cases according to the problem's requirement. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters from user input. It calculates and prints the number of distinct adjacent character groups in the string `s`. Each group is formed by consecutive identical characters. For instance, in the string "aaabbc", there are three groups: "aaa", "bb", and "c". The function does not accept parameters or return a value directly. It assumes valid input based on the given constraints but does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid input or empty strings.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
