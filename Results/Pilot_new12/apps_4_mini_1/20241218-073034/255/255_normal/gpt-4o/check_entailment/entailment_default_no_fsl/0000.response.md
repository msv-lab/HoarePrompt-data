Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to remove the entire string in the minimum number of operations, with each operation allowing us to delete a contiguous substring of equal characters. 

However, the implemented logic simply counts the transitions between different consecutive characters and assumes this count directly correlates with the minimum operations needed. This approach is flawed because it does not account for scenarios where multiple contiguous equal characters can be removed in one operation.

For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `s = "aaaaa"`. The expected output should be `1` because the entire string can be removed in one operation. However, the provided code will output `1`, which is correct in this case. 

Now consider an example from the problem description. For the input `n = 8` and `s = "abcddcba"`, the correct number of operations should indeed be `4`:
- Remove `a`
- Remove `b`
- Remove `c`
- Remove `ddcba` in one operation

The program outputs `7` (the count of unique segments) instead of calculating the minimum number of operations based on the merge-ability of contiguous segments which is the intended functionality.

Thus, the program does not cover all cases correctly and produces incorrect outputs for various inputs where multiple consecutive same characters can be collectively removed.

In addition, for any scenario where the string contains repeated characters, it will not optimize the operations leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the program fails to address the problem requirements in all potential cases.
