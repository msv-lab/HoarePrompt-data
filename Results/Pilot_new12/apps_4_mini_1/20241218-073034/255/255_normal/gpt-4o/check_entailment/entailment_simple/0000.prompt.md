You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \), `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is equal to the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in `s` plus 1.
    print(operations)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
