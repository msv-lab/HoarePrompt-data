You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    operations = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string as per the problem description. The logic used in the program only counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string. This approach does not take into consideration the possibility of merging contiguous substrings of the same character during one operation.

For example, consider the input string "aaabaaa". The minimum operations needed to delete the entire string can be achieved as follows:

1. Delete "aaa" (first contiguous substring of 'a') in one operation.
2. Now the string is "baaa".
3. Delete "aaa" (the remaining contiguous substring of 'a') in one operation.
4. Then finally, delete "b" in one operation.

This results in a total of 3 operations. However, the provided program would count the transitions and return 4 as it sees transitions from 'a' to 'b' and back to 'a' rather than correctly accounting for contiguous deletions.

Thus, there is a potential case where the program does not work as expected. For the input "aaabaaa", the output of the program would incorrectly be 4 instead of the correct 3.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n` (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string `s`, starting the count at 1 for the first character. The final output is the total count of operations, which represents the number of unique character segments in the string, as well as accounting for edge cases such as when all characters are the same or when `n` is 1, where it will still return 1. The function does not return any value; it solely prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
