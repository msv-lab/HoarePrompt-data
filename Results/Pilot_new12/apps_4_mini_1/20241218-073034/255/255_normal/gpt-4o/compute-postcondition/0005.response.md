The variable `operations` is incremented by 1. The value of `operations` is initially 1, so after the operation, it becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is 1, and now `operations` is 2, while the condition regarding the characters at indices `i` and `i - 1` in `s` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `operations` is 2, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` in `s`.**
