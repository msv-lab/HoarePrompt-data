The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `operations`, but indicates it remains unchanged. Therefore, the new value will be `operations + 1`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `s`, and `i`, remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `operations` is now `operations + 1`, `i` is 3**
