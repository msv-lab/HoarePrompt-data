The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a user input and `int` converts that input to an integer. Since `n` is originally defined to be a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \), it now takes on a new value that is also a positive integer within that range based on user input. The string `s` of length `n` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \) (now assigned the value from input); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
