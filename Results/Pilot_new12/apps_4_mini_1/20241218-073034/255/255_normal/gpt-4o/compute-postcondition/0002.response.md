The variable `operations` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `s` being an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \); `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `operations` is 1.**
