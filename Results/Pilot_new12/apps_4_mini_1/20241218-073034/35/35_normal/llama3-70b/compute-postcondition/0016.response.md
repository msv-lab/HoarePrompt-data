After executing the print statement, `x` will be printed as the maximum feasible value satisfying the loop's exit conditions. The initial states of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged but still relevant in their original ranges as integers. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in its original range, `a` is an integer in its original range, `b` is an integer in its original range, `x` is the maximum feasible value satisfying the loop's exit conditions.**
