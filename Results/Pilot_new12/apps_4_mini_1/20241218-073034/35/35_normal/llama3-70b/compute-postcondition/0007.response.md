According to the code, since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute again unless there are external factors that stop it (which are not provided in the current state). Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` has been decremented by 1**
