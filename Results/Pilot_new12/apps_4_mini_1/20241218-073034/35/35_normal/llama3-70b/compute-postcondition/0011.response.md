According to the code, since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute indefinitely unless a break or return statement is encountered within the loop body. Since we have no information about whether a break has occurred or not, the loop can proceed one more time without any adjustments to the state.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is decreased by 1**
