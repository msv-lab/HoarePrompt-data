Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `a - x + (b - x) is greater than or equal to x, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
