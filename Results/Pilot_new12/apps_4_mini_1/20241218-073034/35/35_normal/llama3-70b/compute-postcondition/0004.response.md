The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer where `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer where `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b`. Additionally, `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
