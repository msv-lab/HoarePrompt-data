The function `func` does not explicitly have any parameters as defined in the function signature. However, it operates under the constraints wherein `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` and `b` are integers meeting the condition \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). 

The function's output based on the constraints is not specified. Thus, I cannot infer the specific return value or output behavior beyond mentioning the constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, where a and b are integers in the range 1 to 100. The specific return behavior is not detailed.**
