Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute regardless of the states of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer where `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer where `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b`**
