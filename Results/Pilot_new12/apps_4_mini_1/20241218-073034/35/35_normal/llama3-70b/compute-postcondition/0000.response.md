The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values obtained from input through the `map(int, input().split())` function. This means that the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are set based on user input, which must conform to the constraints: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, and both `a` and `b` are integers constrained by `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`. After executing the code, the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be determined by the user input. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer where `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer where `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`**.
