In the given situation, `x` is assigned the value of the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints indicate that `n` is an integer that can take any value from `2` to `a + b`, while `a` and `b` are both integers ranging from `1` to `100`. 

Since `n` is at least `2` and can be equal to or less than the sum of `a` and `b`, the minimum value `x` can take will depend on the actual values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

1. If `n` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then `x` will be `n`.
2. If `a` is less than `n` but less than or equal to `b`, then `x` will be `a`.
3. If `b` is less than `n` but less than or equal to `a`, then `x` will be `b`.
4. If both `a` and `b` are less than `n`, then `x` will be the smaller of the two, either `a` or `b`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Thus, the Output State must catch the generality of `x` based on the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, since we cannot determine a specific numeric value without knowing these variables' specific values. Therefore, all iterations where `n` is defined within its range and `a` and `b` are as well should be noted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer where `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer where `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b`.**
