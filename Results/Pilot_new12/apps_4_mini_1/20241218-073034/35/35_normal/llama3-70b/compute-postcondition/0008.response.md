The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or any conditional structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
