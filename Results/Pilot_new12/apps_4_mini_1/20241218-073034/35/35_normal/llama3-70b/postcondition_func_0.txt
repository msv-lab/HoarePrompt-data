The function reads three integer inputs: `n`, `a`, and `b`. It determines the maximum value of `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `a`, and `b`, and simultaneously satisfies the condition that `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x` and that the sum of the remaining resources (`a - x + (b - x)`) is still at least `x`. If no such `x` exists, it can reduce down to 0. After executing, it prints the value of `x`, which could potentially be any integer from 0 to the minimum of the inputs. Notably, the function lacks direct error handling for inputs outside defined ranges, and there is an implicit assumption in the while loop that `x` starts no less than 0, which may not be guaranteed if inputs are not valid.
