To determine the correctness of the annotated Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the implementation within the program.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input Specification**: Three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where:
   - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` (the number of pieces of cakes)
   - `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b` (the number of plates)
  
2. **Output Specification**: We need to find the maximum possible integer `x` such that:
   - Each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake.
   - Each piece of each cake is placed on some plate.
   - Each plate contains at least one piece.
   - No plate contains pieces from both cakes.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    print(x)
```
1. **Initial Value of x**: The code initializes `x` as the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. This satisfies the requirement that `x` should not exceed the pieces available from either cake or the number of plates.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues to decrement `x` until the following conditions are met:
     - `a >= x`: Ensures that there's enough of the first cake.
     - `b >= x`: Ensures that there's enough of the second cake.
     - `a - x + (b - x) >= x`: Ensures that the remaining pieces after assigning `x` from both cakes can still satisfy at least `x` on other plates. This condition ensures that all plates can potentially have at least `x` pieces and helps to maximize the minimum number of pieces that can be served to each plate.

3. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `x`, which by the loop conditions ensures that `x` is the largest value possible that still satisfies the distribution requirements.

### Correctness Assessment:
- The program effectively determines the maximum `x` based on the conditions specified in the problem description.
- It adheres to input constraints.
- The loop guarantees that `x` is adjusted correctly and it stops only when the specified conditions for the cake distribution are met.

### Conclusion:
The program, through its logic and structure, meets all the requirements of the problem description. It accurately computes the maximum amount of pieces per plate while adhering to the constraints necessary for cake distribution among plates.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
