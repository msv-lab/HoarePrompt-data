#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b); a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100); b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. The loop terminates when `low` is no longer less than `high`, depending on the behavior of `can_distribute(mid)`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is consistently true for the calculated `mid` values, `low` will converge to `min(a, b) + 1` indicating that no additional distribution can be achieved.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns min(a, b) since low is equal to min(a, b) + 1, and thus low - 1 equals min(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. It aims to determine the maximum number of evenly distributed pieces that can be obtained from two cakes, where `a` represents the number of pieces in the first cake and `b` represents the number of pieces in the second cake. The function employs a binary search strategy to find this maximum distribution by repeatedly calling the helper function `can_distribute(mid)`, which assesses whether it's feasible to distribute `mid` pieces among `n` plates. After the loop concludes, the function returns `min(a, b)`, which indicates that the maximum number of distributed pieces is limited by the minimum number of pieces available between the two cakes. The function does not handle cases where `can_distribute(mid)` might always return false or where `n` exceeds the combined total of `a` and `b`, but it assumes valid input according to the stated constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. x is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces on each plate.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns True if the total number of pieces from cakes a and b, divided by x, is greater than or equal to n; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts a positive integer parameter `x`, and evaluates whether the total number of pieces from two cakes, represented by the positive integers `a` and `b`, can be divided into at least `n` plates such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The function returns True if the sum of the integer divisions `a // x` and `b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`, indicating that the distribution is possible; otherwise, it returns False. It is important to note that the function assumes `a` and `b` are positive integers and `n` is a positive integer satisfying `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, but the absence of checks for these conditions may lead to edge cases where the assumptions are violated, possibly resulting in unexpected behavior.
