Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. It aims to determine the maximum number of evenly distributed pieces that can be obtained from two cakes, where `a` represents the number of pieces in the first cake and `b` represents the number of pieces in the second cake. The function employs a binary search strategy to find this maximum distribution by repeatedly calling the helper function `can_distribute(mid)`, which assesses whether it's feasible to distribute `mid` pieces among `n` plates. After the loop concludes, the function returns `min(a, b)`, which indicates that the maximum number of distributed pieces is limited by the minimum number of pieces available between the two cakes. The function does not handle cases where `can_distribute(mid)` might always return false or where `n` exceeds the combined total of `a` and `b`, but it assumes valid input according to the stated constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).**
