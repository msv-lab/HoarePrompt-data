Output State: **`low` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. The loop terminates when `low` is no longer less than `high`, depending on the behavior of `can_distribute(mid)`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is consistently true for the calculated `mid` values, `low` will converge to `min(a, b) + 1` indicating that no additional distribution can be achieved.**
