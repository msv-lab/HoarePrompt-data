The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, constrained by the condition that it must be between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b`. `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, constrained to be between 1 and 100. `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, also constrained to be between 1 and 100. The function returns the minimum value between `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and return the smaller of the two values `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, returns the minimum of a and b.**
