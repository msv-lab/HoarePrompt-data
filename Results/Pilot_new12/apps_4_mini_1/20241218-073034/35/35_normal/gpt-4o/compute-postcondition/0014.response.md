Given the initial state where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with the conditions provided, and the code assigns a value to `mid` using `(low + high) // 2`, we need to consider the variables `low` and `high` that are not defined in the initial state.

Since the specific values of `low` and `high` are not provided, the statement `mid = (low + high) // 2` shows that `mid` will be calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` are assumed to be present in the program during the code execution, but their specific constraints or values remain undefined in the current context.

Hence, we only know how `mid` is affected by the operation, and the output state must reflect that change without specifying the values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2.**
