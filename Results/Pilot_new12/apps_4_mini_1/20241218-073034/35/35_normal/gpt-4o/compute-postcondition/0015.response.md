To solve this task, we recognize the implications of the code snippet provided. Here's the breakdown of the impact and the output state.

Initial State: `n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2.

1. The variable `mid` itself is not directly affected in this code. However, `low` is updated to a new value.
2. The line `low = mid + 1` indicates that `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`.

Assuming `mid` has a specific value (let's call it `m` for clarity), after execution `low` will be `m + 1`. The other variables ('n', 'a', 'b') remain unchanged as there are no operations affecting them in this code snippet.

Thus, the Output State will mention the conditional constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b`, while updating `low` accordingly. Here’s the concise representation of the output state:

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.**
