Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. If `can_distribute(mid)` is true, `high` remains unchanged while `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, and `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is less than `high`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is also updated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
