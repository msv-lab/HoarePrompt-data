The function `can_distribute` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces on each plate. The function returns `True` if the total number of pieces from cakes `a` and `b`, divided by `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to determine if it is possible to distribute the pieces from the two cakes onto the plates such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns True if the total number of pieces from cakes a and b, divided by x, is greater than or equal to n; otherwise, it returns False.**
