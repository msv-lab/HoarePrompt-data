Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b); `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100); `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100); `low` is 1; `high` is equal to `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`; `mid` is equal to `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`; and `high` is now equal to `mid`.**
