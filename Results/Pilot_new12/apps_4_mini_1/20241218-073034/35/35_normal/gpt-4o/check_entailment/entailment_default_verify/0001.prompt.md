You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem requires distributing pieces of two cakes across multiple plates such that:

1. Each piece of both cakes is placed on some plate.
2. Each plate has at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate contains pieces from both cakes.
4. The minimum number of pieces on any plate (denoted as `x`) is maximized.

### Analysis of Provided Program:

The provided functions are:

1. `func_1(n, a, b)`: This function attempts to find the maximum possible value of `x` using binary search between `1` and `min(a, b) + 1`.

2. `can_distribute(x)`: This function determines if it's feasible to have `n` plates where each plate has at least `x` pieces. It checks if the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Issues in the Code:

- The `can_distribute(x)` function uses the variables `a` and `b` without them being passed as parameters. This will throw a `NameError` if `can_distribute` is called because `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope.

### Testing with Examples:

- Based on the input examples provided in the problem, if we try to run this program, it will fail due to the undefined variables `a` and `b` in the `can_distribute` function.

### Conclusions:

The program does not implement the logic to pass the required parameters to `can_distribute`, thus failing to execute correctly for any input case.

Given the problem requirements and the analysis of the provided code, I can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not function as intended due to the missing variable scope management for `a` and `b` in the `can_distribute` function.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `can_distribute` accepts a positive integer parameter `x`, and evaluates whether the total number of pieces from two cakes, represented by the positive integers `a` and `b`, can be divided into at least `n` plates such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The function returns True if the sum of the integer divisions `a // x` and `b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`, indicating that the distribution is possible; otherwise, it returns False. It is important to note that the function assumes `a` and `b` are positive integers and `n` is a positive integer satisfying `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, but the absence of checks for these conditions may lead to edge cases where the assumptions are violated, possibly resulting in unexpected behavior.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
