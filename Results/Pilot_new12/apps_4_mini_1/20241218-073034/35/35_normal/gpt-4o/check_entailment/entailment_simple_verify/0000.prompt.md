You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we first need to analyze both the logic of the program and potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute pieces of two cakes into `n` plates such that:
1. Each piece of cake is placed on a plate.
2. Each plate contains at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate contains pieces from both cakes.
4. Maximize the minimum number of pieces `x` that each plate can hold.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(n, a, b)`**: This is the main function that uses binary search to find the maximum possible `x`.
2. **`can_distribute(x)`**: This function checks if it's possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces.

The binary search is performed on the number of pieces (from 1 to `min(a, b) + 1`). The check is done by dividing the number of pieces from each cake by `x`, and ensuring that their sum is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Allowed Inputs**: 
   - Input: `n=2, a=1, b=1`. This means we have 2 plates, but only 2 pieces of cake (1 from each cake). In this case, `can_distribute(1)` should return `True`, as each plate will have 1 piece. The expected output is `1`.
   
2. **More Plates than Pieces**:
   - Input: `n=3, a=1, b=1`. Here, there are more plates than pieces of cake. No matter the value of `x`, it would be impossible to satisfy the condition that all plates have at least one piece. The expected output should be `0`, but the function would return `0` based on the logic, which is correctly handled.

3. **Maximum Limits**: 
   - Input: `n=4, a=100, b=100`. This tests the upper limits of inputs. The function should correctly compute the maximum `x` that can be distributed among the plates. Based on the distribution, the maximum `x` should be `50`, as you can place 50 pieces on each of the four plates using pieces from both cakes.

### Conclusion
After checking various edge cases:
- The binary search correctly identifies the maximum possible minimum pieces `x` by narrowing down on possible values, ensuring that all plates are satisfied with at least `x` pieces.
- The `can_distribute` function correctly validates whether the division of pieces allows for the required number of plates.

Since I can't find any input case where the program fails or gives incorrect results, the provided logic seems consistent with the task description.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b); a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100); b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n`, `a`, `b` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. The loop terminates when `low` is no longer less than `high`, depending on the behavior of `can_distribute(mid)`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is consistently true for the calculated `mid` values, `low` will converge to `min(a, b) + 1` indicating that no additional distribution can be achieved.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns min(a, b) since low is equal to min(a, b) + 1, and thus low - 1 equals min(a, b)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. x is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces on each plate.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns True if the total number of pieces from cakes a and b, divided by x, is greater than or equal to n; otherwise, it returns False.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
