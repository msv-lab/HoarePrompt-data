To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the important aspects of both.

**Problem Description Summary:**
- We need to distribute pieces of two cakes (referred to as `a` and `b`) onto `n` plates.
- Each plate must contain:
  - At least one piece of cake.
  - Pieces only from one of the two cakes (no mixing).
- We need to maximize the minimum number of pieces on the plates.

The output should be the highest number `x` such that each plate can have at least `x` pieces.

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads integers `n`, `a`, and `b` properly.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search to find the maximum minimum `x`.
   - `low` starts at `1`, and `high` is initialized to `min(a, b) + 1`, which is a reasonable upper bound since we cannot place more pieces than are available in the smaller cake.

3. **The `can_distribute` Function:**
   - This function checks if it is possible to distribute pieces such that every plate gets at least `x` pieces.
   - It divides the total pieces from each cake by `x` and sums them. If this sum is greater than or equal to `n`, it indicates that we can satisfy the requirement across the `n` plates.

4. **Logic Flow:**
   - The while loop continues to narrow down the possible values of `x` until `low` is no longer less than `high`, effectively zeroing in on the maximum feasible minimum.

5. **Final Return Value:**
   - The return statement `return low - 1` correctly provides the maximum minimum number of pieces that can be distributed on the plates.

**Correctness Verification:**
The program correctly implements the requirements as laid out in the problem description. The checks for pieces on each plate, ensuring no mixing of cake types, and finding the maximum possible `x` are all handled correctly by the algorithm.

Through a binary search approach combined with checks in `can_distribute`, the program efficiently determines the greatest possible minimum number of pieces that can be placed on each plate.

**Conclusion:** 
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, handling all possible valid scenarios within the input constraints. Therefore, the final decision regarding correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
