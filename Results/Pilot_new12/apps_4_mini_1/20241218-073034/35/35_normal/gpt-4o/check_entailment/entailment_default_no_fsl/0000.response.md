The provided code aims to determine the maximum possible number of cake pieces that Ivan can distribute on each plate while adhering to the conditions specified in the problem description. 

### Breakdown of the Code's Logic
1. **Binary Search Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b)` initializes a binary search between 1 and `min(a, b) + 1` to find the maximum number `x` that satisfies the conditions.
   - The loop runs as long as `low < high`, and it checks whether a given midpoint `mid` can be distributed across `n` plates using the `can_distribute(mid)` function.

2. **Distribution Check**:
   - The helper function `can_distribute(x)` checks whether it's possible to distribute at least `x` pieces to `n` plates. It does this by calculating how many whole groups of `x` can be formed from the total pieces of both cakes (`a` and `b`).

### Checking for Correctness
While the logic uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum distribution `x`, we need to assess if it handles all cases correctly.

1. **Condition Validity**:
   - The code assumes that `a` and `b` are positive and that the input is valid per constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b). Given the problem states valid input, we are not testing for erroneous inputs.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - A potential issue arises in scenarios where the total pieces available (`a + b`) are slightly greater than `n`, but there are not enough total pieces to allow for `x` to be greater than `1`. For instance, consider:
     - Input: `n = 3`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`. Here, `a // x + b // x < n` for any `x > 1`, resulting in all plates having fewer pieces than required.
     - The result will be incorrectly calculated since there won't be enough total pieces to make `x` greater than `1`, but the highest it can distribute would be `1`.

3. **Failure in Finding Maximum x**: The binary search mechanism may not properly account for configurations where the distribution condition fails, particularly when the pieces are tightly constrained and can't evenly spread pieces across plates.

Given the above observations, especially with how `can_distribute` handles certain configurations and its reliance on total piece availability, it becomes clear that there are scenarios where the logic fails to account for imbalances in distribution.

### Conclusion
Therefore, due to these considerations, the code does not correctly handle every potential case as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
