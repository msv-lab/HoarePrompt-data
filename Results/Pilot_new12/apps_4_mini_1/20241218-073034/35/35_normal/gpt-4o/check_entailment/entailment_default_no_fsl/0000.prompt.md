You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Functions with output description for each function:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. It aims to determine the maximum number of evenly distributed pieces that can be obtained from two cakes, where `a` represents the number of pieces in the first cake and `b` represents the number of pieces in the second cake. The function employs a binary search strategy to find this maximum distribution by repeatedly calling the helper function `can_distribute(mid)`, which assesses whether it's feasible to distribute `mid` pieces among `n` plates. After the loop concludes, the function returns `min(a, b)`, which indicates that the maximum number of distributed pieces is limited by the minimum number of pieces available between the two cakes. The function does not handle cases where `can_distribute(mid)` might always return false or where `n` exceeds the combined total of `a` and `b`, but it assumes valid input according to the stated constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b).
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `can_distribute` accepts a positive integer parameter `x`, and evaluates whether the total number of pieces from two cakes, represented by the positive integers `a` and `b`, can be divided into at least `n` plates such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The function returns True if the sum of the integer divisions `a // x` and `b // x` is greater than or equal to `n`, indicating that the distribution is possible; otherwise, it returns False. It is important to note that the function assumes `a` and `b` are positive integers and `n` is a positive integer satisfying `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, but the absence of checks for these conditions may lead to edge cases where the assumptions are violated, possibly resulting in unexpected behavior.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
