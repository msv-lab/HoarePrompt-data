You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`, the expected output should be `?`, because we have a scenario where if the unknown voter upvotes, the result will be `+`, and if they downvote, the result will be `-`. However, the program will give the output `?` due to the `elif x == y:` condition, which is incorrect in this situation. 

Another case where the program fails is when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`, where the output should be `0`, but the logic does not explicitly handle this case, leading to potential incorrect outputs. 

Thus, the program fails to account for all scenarios and does not produce the expected results for every input.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `z` is equal to 0, then `x`, `y`, and `z` are such that `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x`, `y`, `z` remain integers that satisfy the conditions 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and the current value of `x` equals `y`.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` equals 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` satisfy `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain integers satisfying 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and `x = y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still integers satisfying the conditions and the output is '?'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is `'-'`. If `x` equals `y`, then either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or if `z` is greater than 0, the conditions are maintained with `x = y`, `x <= y + z`, and all integers remain valid. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?' while still satisfying the initial conditions.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` equals `y`, the output depends on the value of `z`: either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or `z` is greater than 0, maintaining `x = y` and satisfying the other conditions. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, each constrained between 0 and 100. It evaluates the relationship between these integers and produces different outputs based on certain conditions: if `x` is greater than `y + z`, it outputs '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it outputs '-'. If `x` equals `y`, it further checks the value of `z`: if `z` is 0, it outputs '0', while if `z` is greater than 0, it outputs '?'. If `x` is not equal to either `y` or `y + z`, the output will also be '?'. Therefore, the function effectively categorizes the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z` and returns an appropriate string without returning any values. Additionally, the function lacks handling for cases where the input values are out of the specified bounds (0 to 100).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
