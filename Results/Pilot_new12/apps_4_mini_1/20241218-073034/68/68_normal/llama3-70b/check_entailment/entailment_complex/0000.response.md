The program evaluates three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively. It correctly follows the requirements outlined in the problem description by performing the following checks:

1. **Check if `x` is greater than `y + z`:** 
    - If true, it prints `'+'`, indicating that there are more confirmed upvotes than all possible downvotes.
  
2. **Check if `x` is less than `y`:**
    - If true, it prints `'-'`, indicating that there are more downvotes than confirmed upvotes.
  
3. **Check if `x` equals `y`:**
    - If `z` is `0`, it prints `'0'`, indicating that the votes are tied without uncertainty.
    - If `z` is greater than `0`, it prints `'?'`, indicating that the result is uncertain since the unknown votes could sway the result in favor of either upvotes or downvotes.

4. **For the case where `x` is less than `y + z` but greater than `y`:**
    - The implementation prints `'?'`, which is consistent with the description that if the upvotes do not exceed possible downvotes and unknowns, the result remains uncertain in scenarios where there could be variability in how the unknowns vote.

Considering all the states of the program, it handles all possible combinations of `x`, `y`, and `z`, ensuring an appropriate output for every scenario defined in the problem. Thus, it successfully satisfies the problem description without omitting any case.

Correctness: **True**
