You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function.

The function reads three integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) which indicate the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively.

1. **Case when \( x > y + z \)**:
   - If all uncertain votes (\( z \)) are taken away from downvotes, then it still results in more upvotes than downvotes. This correctly outputs '+'.

2. **Case when \( x < y \)**:
   - In this case, no matter how the uncertain votes are distributed, the downvotes will always exceed the upvotes. This correctly outputs '-'.

3. **Case when \( x == y \)**:
   - If there are no uncertain votes (\( z == 0 \)), the votes are equal, leading to a definitive output of '0', which is correct.
   - If there are uncertain votes (\( z > 0 \)), there are potential scenarios:
     - If one uncertain vote goes to an upvote, the result would be '+', and if it goes to a downvote, the result would be '-'. This means the result is uncertain, which is correctly outputted as '?'.

4. **Final Else Statement**: 
   - This case typically handles situations where it is uncertain due to the numbers. However, the conditions in the previous checks cover all logical scenarios involving the votes.

After analyzing the implementation, I find no issues in the logic for any potential case described. It covers all combinations of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) effectively.

Thus, the program meets the requirements as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, each constrained between 0 and 100. It evaluates the relationship between these integers and produces different outputs based on certain conditions: if `x` is greater than `y + z`, it outputs '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it outputs '-'. If `x` equals `y`, it further checks the value of `z`: if `z` is 0, it outputs '0', while if `z` is greater than 0, it outputs '?'. If `x` is not equal to either `y` or `y + z`, the output will also be '?'. Therefore, the function effectively categorizes the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z` and returns an appropriate string without returning any values. Additionally, the function lacks handling for cases where the input values are out of the specified bounds (0 to 100).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
