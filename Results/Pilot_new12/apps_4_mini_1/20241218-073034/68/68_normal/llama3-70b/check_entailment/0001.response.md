Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`, the expected output should be `?`, because we have a scenario where if the unknown voter upvotes, the result will be `+`, and if they downvote, the result will be `-`. However, the program will give the output `?` due to the `elif x == y:` condition, which is incorrect in this situation. 

Another case where the program fails is when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`, where the output should be `0`, but the logic does not explicitly handle this case, leading to potential incorrect outputs. 

Thus, the program fails to account for all scenarios and does not produce the expected results for every input.
