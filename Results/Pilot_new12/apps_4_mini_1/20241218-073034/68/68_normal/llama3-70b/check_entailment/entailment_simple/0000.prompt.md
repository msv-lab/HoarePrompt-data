You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `z` is equal to 0, then `x`, `y`, and `z` are such that `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x`, `y`, `z` remain integers that satisfy the conditions 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and the current value of `x` equals `y`.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` equals 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` satisfy `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain integers satisfying 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and `x = y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still integers satisfying the conditions and the output is '?'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is `'-'`. If `x` equals `y`, then either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or if `z` is greater than 0, the conditions are maintained with `x = y`, `x <= y + z`, and all integers remain valid. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?' while still satisfying the initial conditions.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` equals `y`, the output depends on the value of `z`: either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or `z` is greater than 0, maintaining `x = y` and satisfying the other conditions. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
