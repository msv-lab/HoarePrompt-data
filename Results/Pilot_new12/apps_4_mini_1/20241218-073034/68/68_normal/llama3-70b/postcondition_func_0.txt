The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, each constrained between 0 and 100. It evaluates the relationship between these integers and produces different outputs based on certain conditions: if `x` is greater than `y + z`, it outputs '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it outputs '-'. If `x` equals `y`, it further checks the value of `z`: if `z` is 0, it outputs '0', while if `z` is greater than 0, it outputs '?'. If `x` is not equal to either `y` or `y + z`, the output will also be '?'. Therefore, the function effectively categorizes the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z` and returns an appropriate string without returning any values. Additionally, the function lacks handling for cases where the input values are out of the specified bounds (0 to 100).
