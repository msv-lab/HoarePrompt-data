Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` equals `y`, the output depends on the value of `z`: either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or `z` is greater than 0, maintaining `x = y` and satisfying the other conditions. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'.***
