The code `print('0')` produces output but does not affect any variable values or the state of the program. The conditions about `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, because no assignments or changes to those variables are made. Specifically, `x` remains equal to `y`, and `z` remains equal to 0.

Output State: **`0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, `x = y`, and `z = 0`.**
