The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition. However, based on the constraints provided, there are three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained to the values between 0 and 100 inclusive. The function will return a value based on certain conditions regarding these integers.

As there are no specific output cases provided in the given output, we cannot define specific behavior or return values. Assuming a typical structure, we will outline the conditional return statements based on the integer values.

Considering that no specific behavior was described for the outputs in relation to `x`, `y`, and `z`, we can conclude the following:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and it can return different values based on internal conditions related to integers that are bounded between 0 and 100.**
