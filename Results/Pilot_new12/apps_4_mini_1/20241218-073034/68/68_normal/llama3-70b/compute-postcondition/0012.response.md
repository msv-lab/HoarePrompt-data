Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `z` is equal to 0, then `x`, `y`, and `z` are such that `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x`, `y`, `z` remain integers that satisfy the conditions 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and the current value of `x` equals `y`.***
