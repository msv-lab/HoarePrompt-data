Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` equals 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` satisfy `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain integers satisfying 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and `x = y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still integers satisfying the conditions and the output is '?'.***
