The line `print('?')` outputs the string `'?'` but does not change any variable values. The constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since no assignments or modifications occur.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`; output is '?'**
