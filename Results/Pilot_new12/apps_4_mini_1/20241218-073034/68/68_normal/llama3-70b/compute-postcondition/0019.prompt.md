You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `z` is equal to 0, then `x`, `y`, and `z` are such that `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x`, `y`, `z` remain integers that satisfy the conditions 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and the current value of `x` equals `y`.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` equals 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` satisfy `x = y` and `z = 0`. If `z` is greater than 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain integers satisfying 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x <= y + z`, `x >= y`, and `x = y`. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still integers satisfying the conditions and the output is '?'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is `'-'`. If `x` equals `y`, then either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or if `z` is greater than 0, the conditions are maintained with `x = y`, `x <= y + z`, and all integers remain valid. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?' while still satisfying the initial conditions.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` equals `y`, the output depends on the value of `z`: either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or `z` is greater than 0, maintaining `x = y` and satisfying the other conditions. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and it can return different values based on internal conditions related to integers that are bounded between 0 and 100.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
