The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values through the `map(int, input().split())` function, that converts the input from the user into integers. The initial state indicates that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers constrained between 0 and 100. After executing the code, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will depend on the specific integers provided as input by the user. Therefore, the precise values for `x`, `y`, and `z` are unknown and will be updated based on user input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
