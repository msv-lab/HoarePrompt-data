Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is `'-'`. If `x` equals `y`, then either `z` equals 0 (yielding `x = y` and `z = 0`), or if `z` is greater than 0, the conditions are maintained with `x = y`, `x <= y + z`, and all integers remain valid. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?' while still satisfying the initial conditions.***
