The code simply prints a '+' symbol to the output. However, no values of the variables are modified or assigned. The states of the variables remain unchanged. The output does not affect the variables, but we acknowledge that the print statement has executed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers assigned values from user input such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The current value of `x` is greater than the sum of the current values of `y` and `z`. The output is '+'**.
