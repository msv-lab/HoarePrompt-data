The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The variable `x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, and `z` is also an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes`, which is the sum of `x` and `z`, will also be in the range of 0 <= `max_upvotes` <= 200. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
