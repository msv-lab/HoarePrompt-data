The code executes a print statement which outputs a '?' character. There are no variables being modified or assigned new values in this statement. Thus, the initial state remains valid after execution.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z >= x`); a '?' character has been printed.**
