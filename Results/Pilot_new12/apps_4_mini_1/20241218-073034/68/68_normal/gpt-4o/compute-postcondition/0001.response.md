The code assigns the value of `x` to `min_upvotes`. Since `x` will take on a value from user input, we can't determine its specific value, but we know that `min_upvotes` will now have the same value as `x`. The initial conditions for `x`, `y`, and `z` are still valid.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.**
