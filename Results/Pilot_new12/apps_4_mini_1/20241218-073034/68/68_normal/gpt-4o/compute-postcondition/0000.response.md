The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from the user input after being split into three parts and converted to integers. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are overwritten with the new values from the input. 

Since the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after the input are not known, but they remain within the bounds of 0 to 100, the Output State will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now equal to whatever values the user provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, 0 <= `z` <= 100, with new values assigned from user input.**
