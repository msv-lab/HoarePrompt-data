min_downvotes is assigned the value of y. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state captures all previous conditions, including the new value of min_downvotes.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
