The code simply prints a plus sign '+' and does not change any variable values. The preconditions regarding the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`); the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z < x`; printed '+'**
