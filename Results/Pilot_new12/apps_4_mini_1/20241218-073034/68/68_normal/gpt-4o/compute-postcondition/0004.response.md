The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` can range from 0 to 100, so `max_downvotes` will range from `0 + 0 = 0` to `100 + 100 = 200`. The values of other variables, specifically `x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`, remain unaffected in their states. 

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
