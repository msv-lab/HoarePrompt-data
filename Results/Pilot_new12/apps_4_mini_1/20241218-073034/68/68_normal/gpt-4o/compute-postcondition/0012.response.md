Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, and 0 <= `z` <= 100. If the current value of `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then a '+' character is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, a '?' character is printed.***
