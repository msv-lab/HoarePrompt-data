The code snippet simply prints a hyphen ('-'). It does not impact any variable or logic in the program. The initial state remains valid as it was, and no variables change. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is an integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is an integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`, and a hyphen ('-') has been printed.**
