The function reads three integers x, y, and z from input, which represent upvotes, downvotes, and a margin, respectively, constrained between 0 and 100. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible values for upvotes and downvotes: min_upvotes is x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is y, and max_downvotes is y + z. Based on these values, it determines the relationship between upvotes and downvotes. If the maximum possible upvotes is less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints a hyphen ('-'), indicating that downvotes exceed the highest possible upvotes. If the maximum possible downvotes is less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints a plus sign ('+'), indicating that upvotes exceed the highest possible downvotes. If neither of these conditions is met, it prints a question mark ('?'), indicating an overlap where the upvotes and downvotes cannot be conclusively compared. The function does not return anything, and after its execution, the integers x, y, and z remain within the range of 0 to 100. The function handles edge cases where x, y, or z are at their minimum or maximum values.
