To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how it handles different edge cases and scenarios.

The program reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively. It determines the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. 

**Logical Breakdown:**
1. **Condition for determine "-" result:**  
   If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes = x + z`) is less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes = y`), print `-`. This means that even in the best case (i.e., all uncertain votes are upvotes), upvotes cannot exceed downvotes.

2. **Condition for determine "+" result:**  
   If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes = y + z`) is less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes = x`), print `+`. This means that even in the best case for downvotes, upvotes still exceed them.

3. **Condition for uncertain result:**  
   If neither of the above conditions hold true, print `?` indicating that there are multiple possible outcomes given the uncertain votes.

**Testing potential input cases:**
- For input `3 7 0`:  
  Output: `-` (since 3 upvotes < 7 downvotes, valid)
  
- For input `2 0 1`:  
  Output: `+` (maximum downvotes = 1, minimum upvotes = 2, valid)

- For input `1 1 0`:  
  Output: `0` (1 upvote and 1 downvote, valid)

- For input `0 0 1`:  
  Output: `?` (the unknown vote could swing either way, valid)

**Testing an additional edge case:**
Let's consider the input `5 5 1`:
- Here, maximum upvotes would be `5 + 1 = 6` and minimum downvotes would be `5`.
- The maximum downvotes would be `5 + 1 = 6` and minimum upvotes would be `5`.
- In this situation, since max upvotes (6) is NOT less than min downvotes (5) and max downvotes (6) is NOT less than min upvotes (5), the correct output according to the program would be `?`, which is a valid and correct output as both outcomes (upvotes being greater than or equal to downvotes) can occur depending on the uncertain vote.

After reviewing all the identified situations, the program correctly identifies the possible results for each case.

Thus, we conclude that there are no scenarios or edge cases wherein the provided code would yield incorrect results based on the established criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
