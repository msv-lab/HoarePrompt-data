To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the description, let's examine the logic implemented in the `func()` function in light of the requirements given in the problem statement.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: The program reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.
2. **Calculations**:
   - `min_upvotes` is set to `x`: the minimum number of upvotes.
   - `max_upvotes` is set to `x + z`: the maximum number of upvotes (considering all unknown votes upvote).
   - `min_downvotes` is set to `y`: the minimum number of downvotes.
   - `max_downvotes` is set to `y + z`: the maximum number of downvotes (considering all unknown votes downvote).
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it concludes that downvotes are guaranteed to be more, hence prints `'-'`.
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it concludes that upvotes are guaranteed to be more, hence prints `'+'`.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Edge Cases and Testing:
Now, let's consider various test cases to ensure the logic is correct:

1. **Case**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7` → Output: `'-'` (Correct)
   
2. **Case**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Output: `'+'` (Correct)

3. **Case**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1` → Output: `'0'` (Incorrect; should print `0` as per problem)

4. **Case**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - Here, the potential outcomes are:
     - If the unknown votes upvote: Result is `'+'`
     - If the unknown votes downvote: Result is `'-'`
   - Therefore the output must be `?` (Correct)

From these tests, we can see that while the majority of cases are handled correctly, the one case where `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0` is outputting `?` where it should be `0` according to the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The output is not correct in every potential case. The specific case where both known votes are equal and there are no unknown votes leads to the program behaving incorrectly since it outputs question mark instead of returning zero when it should.

Thus, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
