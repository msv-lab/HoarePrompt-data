Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the uncertainty condition should be based on the ranges of upvotes and downvotes. The only situation where uncertainty (`?`) is correctly reported is when there are unknown votes. However, the program fails to handle the case where the results could potentially overlap depending on the unknown votes.

For example, consider the input:

```
0 0 1
```

This indicates that there are no defined upvotes or downvotes but one unknown voter. In this scenario, the output should indeed be `?` because the single unknown vote can either make the result `+` if upvoted or `-` if downvoted. In this case, the program correctly outputs `?`.

However, the program fails in scenarios like:

```
2 1 2
```

Here, we have:
- Minimum upvotes = 2 (since x=2)
- Maximum upvotes = 4 (since x+z=2+2)
- Minimum downvotes = 1 (since y=1)
- Maximum downvotes = 3 (since y+z=1+2)

In this scenario, the possible results would overlap: it could output `+` (if the additional downvotes are not counted), `-` (if they are counted as downvotes), or `0` depending on the distribution of the uncertain votes. The program fails to capture this uncertainty correctly by returning `?`, as given the ranges, the exact outcome cannot be determined.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements described, and that is why I declare it incorrect.
