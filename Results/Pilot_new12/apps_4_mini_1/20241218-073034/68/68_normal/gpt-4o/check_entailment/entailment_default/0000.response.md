The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the voting result based on the counts of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes. The calculations for minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes are accurately performed. 

Here's how the code works:

1. It calculates the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`) as `x`, which is straightforward.
2. The maximum upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is calculated as `x + z`, accounting for all uncertain votes being upvotes.
3. Similarly, it calculates the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`) as `y` and the maximum downvotes (`max_downvotes`) as `y + z`.
4. The program then evaluates:
   - If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it correctly concludes that the result must be "-" (downvotes exceed upvotes).
   - If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it correctly concludes "+" (upvotes exceed downvotes).
   - In cases where there is an overlap or uncertainty in voting results, it outputs "?", indicating that the result cannot be determined conclusively.

The output hints provided align with the intended logic of the code. 

To verify correctness against all edge cases:
- For inputs like `0 0 1`, which results in unknown votes leading to uncertain outcomes, the output is correctly marked as "?". 
- For inputs such as `3 7 0`, it clearly leads to a "-", confirming that downvotes exceed upvotes.
- For one certain upvote and uncertain downvote conditions, such as `2 0 1`, the results reflect `"+"`.

The program handles every case correctly according to the problem specification without any exceptions that can lead to inaccuracies.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
