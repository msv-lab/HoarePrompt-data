You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how it handles different edge cases and scenarios.

The program reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively. It determines the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. 

**Logical Breakdown:**
1. **Condition for determine "-" result:**  
   If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes = x + z`) is less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes = y`), print `-`. This means that even in the best case (i.e., all uncertain votes are upvotes), upvotes cannot exceed downvotes.

2. **Condition for determine "+" result:**  
   If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes = y + z`) is less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes = x`), print `+`. This means that even in the best case for downvotes, upvotes still exceed them.

3. **Condition for uncertain result:**  
   If neither of the above conditions hold true, print `?` indicating that there are multiple possible outcomes given the uncertain votes.

**Testing potential input cases:**
- For input `3 7 0`:  
  Output: `-` (since 3 upvotes < 7 downvotes, valid)
  
- For input `2 0 1`:  
  Output: `+` (maximum downvotes = 1, minimum upvotes = 2, valid)

- For input `1 1 0`:  
  Output: `0` (1 upvote and 1 downvote, valid)

- For input `0 0 1`:  
  Output: `?` (the unknown vote could swing either way, valid)

**Testing an additional edge case:**
Let's consider the input `5 5 1`:
- Here, maximum upvotes would be `5 + 1 = 6` and minimum downvotes would be `5`.
- The maximum downvotes would be `5 + 1 = 6` and minimum upvotes would be `5`.
- In this situation, since max upvotes (6) is NOT less than min downvotes (5) and max downvotes (6) is NOT less than min upvotes (5), the correct output according to the program would be `?`, which is a valid and correct output as both outcomes (upvotes being greater than or equal to downvotes) can occur depending on the uncertain vote.

After reviewing all the identified situations, the program correctly identifies the possible results for each case.

Thus, we conclude that there are no scenarios or edge cases wherein the provided code would yield incorrect results based on the established criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, and 0 <= `z` <= 100. If the current value of `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then a '+' character is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, a '?' character is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, and 0 <= `z` <= 100. If `max_upvotes` (i.e., `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `y`), a hyphen ('-') is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then a '+' character is printed. If `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, a '?' character is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers x, y, and z from input, which represent upvotes, downvotes, and a margin, respectively, constrained between 0 and 100. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible values for upvotes and downvotes: min_upvotes is x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is y, and max_downvotes is y + z. Based on these values, it determines the relationship between upvotes and downvotes. If the maximum possible upvotes is less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints a hyphen ('-'), indicating that downvotes exceed the highest possible upvotes. If the maximum possible downvotes is less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints a plus sign ('+'), indicating that upvotes exceed the highest possible downvotes. If neither of these conditions is met, it prints a question mark ('?'), indicating an overlap where the upvotes and downvotes cannot be conclusively compared. The function does not return anything, and after its execution, the integers x, y, and z remain within the range of 0 to 100. The function handles edge cases where x, y, or z are at their minimum or maximum values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
