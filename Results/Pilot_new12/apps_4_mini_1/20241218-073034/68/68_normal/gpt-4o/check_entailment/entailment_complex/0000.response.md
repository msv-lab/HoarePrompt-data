The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement regarding the voting outcomes based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes.

### Explanation of the Program Logic:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.

2. **Calculating Min/Max Values**:
    - `min_upvotes` is set to `x` (since the minimum upvotes is the count of known upvotes).
    - `max_upvotes` is calculated as `x + z` (adding the unknown votes since they can all potentially be upvotes).
    - `min_downvotes` is set to `y` (minimum downvotes is the count of known downvotes).
    - `max_downvotes` is `y + z` (adding the unknown votes since they can all potentially be downvotes).

3. **Determining the Result**:
    - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, this indicates that the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes. Hence, print `'-'`.
    - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it indicates that the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes. Thus, print `'+'`.
    - If neither of these conditions is true, it signifies that there is an overlap in potential totals. Therefore, print `'?'`.

### Analysis of Requirements:

The program accurately matches the required output conditions:
- If there's a definite winner between upvotes and downvotes, it outputs either `'-'` or `'+'`.
- If the two possible outcomes overlap due to the uncertain votes (`z`), it outputs `'?'`.
- The edge cases mentioned in the problem (like having 0 upvotes or downvotes and some uncertain votes) are correctly handled through the conditions set.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program correctly identifies and outputs the results based on the provided conditions and it adheres strictly to the logic outlined in the problem description without missing any specific cases:

Correctness: **True**
