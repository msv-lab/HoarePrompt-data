You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
        print('-')
    elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the description, let's examine the logic implemented in the `func()` function in light of the requirements given in the problem statement.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**: The program reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.
2. **Calculations**:
   - `min_upvotes` is set to `x`: the minimum number of upvotes.
   - `max_upvotes` is set to `x + z`: the maximum number of upvotes (considering all unknown votes upvote).
   - `min_downvotes` is set to `y`: the minimum number of downvotes.
   - `max_downvotes` is set to `y + z`: the maximum number of downvotes (considering all unknown votes downvote).
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it concludes that downvotes are guaranteed to be more, hence prints `'-'`.
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it concludes that upvotes are guaranteed to be more, hence prints `'+'`.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Edge Cases and Testing:
Now, let's consider various test cases to ensure the logic is correct:

1. **Case**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7` → Output: `'-'` (Correct)
   
2. **Case**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Output: `'+'` (Correct)

3. **Case**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1` → Output: `'0'` (Incorrect; should print `0` as per problem)

4. **Case**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - Here, the potential outcomes are:
     - If the unknown votes upvote: Result is `'+'`
     - If the unknown votes downvote: Result is `'-'`
   - Therefore the output must be `?` (Correct)

From these tests, we can see that while the majority of cases are handled correctly, the one case where `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0` is outputting `?` where it should be `0` according to the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The output is not correct in every potential case. The specific case where both known votes are equal and there are no unknown votes leads to the program behaving incorrectly since it outputs question mark instead of returning zero when it should.

Thus, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, and 0 <= `z` <= 100. If the current value of `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then a '+' character is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, a '?' character is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 100, 0 <= `y` <= 100, and 0 <= `z` <= 100. If `max_upvotes` (i.e., `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `y`), a hyphen ('-') is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` (i.e., `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `x`), then a '+' character is printed. If `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, a '?' character is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers x, y, and z from input, which represent upvotes, downvotes, and a margin, respectively, constrained between 0 and 100. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible values for upvotes and downvotes: min_upvotes is x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is y, and max_downvotes is y + z. Based on these values, it determines the relationship between upvotes and downvotes. If the maximum possible upvotes is less than the minimum possible downvotes, it prints a hyphen ('-'), indicating that downvotes exceed the highest possible upvotes. If the maximum possible downvotes is less than the minimum possible upvotes, it prints a plus sign ('+'), indicating that upvotes exceed the highest possible downvotes. If neither of these conditions is met, it prints a question mark ('?'), indicating an overlap where the upvotes and downvotes cannot be conclusively compared. The function does not return anything, and after its execution, the integers x, y, and z remain within the range of 0 to 100. The function handles edge cases where x, y, or z are at their minimum or maximum values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
