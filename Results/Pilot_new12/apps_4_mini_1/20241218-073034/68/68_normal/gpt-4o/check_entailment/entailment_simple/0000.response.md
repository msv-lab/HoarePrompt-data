The provided program attempts to determine the result of the voting scenario based on the values of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`). Let's analyze it step by step against the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads three integers from input and maps them to `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - The constraints specified in the problem (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) are respected.

2. **Calculating Minimum and Maximum Votes**:
   - The program correctly calculates:
     - `min_upvotes = x` (minimum upvotes)
     - `max_upvotes = x + z` (maximum upvotes possible)
     - `min_downvotes = y` (minimum downvotes)
     - `max_downvotes = y + z` (maximum downvotes possible)

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The program has two major conditions:
     - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it signifies that even in the best case for Nauuo (all unknown votes as upvotes), downvotes are still greater. This leads to outputting "-".
     - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it indicates that in the worst case for Nauuo (all unknown votes as downvotes), upvotes are still greater. This leads to outputting "+".
     - If neither condition is satisfied, at least one voting scenario is uncertain, and it outputs "?".
   
4. **Coverage of All Cases**:
   - The program effectively considers all potential voting configurations based on maximum and minimum values.
   - Based on the logic provided, it outputs correctly for scenarios where:
     - Upvotes clearly exceed downvotes (+).
     - Downvotes clearly exceed upvotes (-).
     - Equal upvotes and downvotes (0).
     - When there is uncertainty due to the unknown votes (?).
   
### Conclusion

The annotated program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly identifies all cases of voting outcomes and handles them as specified.

Thus, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
