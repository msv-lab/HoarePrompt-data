You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the value of B - C based on the problem description. The approach taken is flawed because it sorts the array in descending order and then assigns elements alternately to sequences b and c. This does not guarantee that the maximum possible value of B - C is achieved.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where the input is:
```
3
-1 -2 -3
```
In this scenario, the output should ideally be:
- Let b = {-1}, C = {-2, -3} → B - C = -1 - (-2 - 3) = -1 + 5 = 4

However, the provided program will result in:
- Sorting gives us the same list as input since all elements are negative →  b will take -1 (index 0) and c will take -2 (index 1) and -3 (index 2)
- Computed B = -1, C = -5 → Result will be -1 - (-5) = -1 + 5 = 4, which is correct.

But let's consider an array like:
```
5
1 -1 1 -1 1
```
Here, the correct partition that maximizes B - C would be to take all positive values in b and all negative values in c:
- b = {1, 1, 1}, c = {-1, -1} yields B = 3, C = -2 → 3 - (-2) = 5

The program will alternate and yield:
- b = {1, 1} for the first two 1s and -1 in c → B = 1 + 1 = 2, C = -1 - 1 = -2 -> Output = 4, which is wrong.

Thus, the program does not always yield the maximum B - C for arbitrary input, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user input. It then sorts the list in descending order and calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (stored in variable `b`) and the sum of the integers at odd indices (stored in variable `c`). Finally, it prints the result of the subtraction `b - c`. The function operates under the constraints that `n` is between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list can range from -100 to 100. The function does not return any value but outputs the computed difference. Edge cases that could arise include handling lists where all numbers are negative or positive, as well as scenarios where the counts of odd and even indexed elements differ (for instance, when `n` is odd).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
