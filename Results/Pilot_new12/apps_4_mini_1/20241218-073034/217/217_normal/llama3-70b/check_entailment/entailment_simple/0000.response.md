To determine whether the provided annotated program meets the problem description, we need to closely analyze both the problem requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to partition a sequence of integers into two parts `b` and `c` such that the maximum possible value of `B - C` is computed, where:
- `B` is the sum of sequence `b`.
- `C` is the sum of sequence `c`.
- Each integer must belong to either sequence `b` or `c`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of integers, `n`, and then reads the list `a` of integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in descending order. This means the largest integers will be placed at the beginning of the list.

3. **Partitioning Logic**:
   - The program uses a for loop to iterate through the sorted list:
     - It adds elements at even indices to `b` and elements at odd indices to `c`.
   - This results in a partitioning that prioritizes larger numbers being added to `b`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The difference `b - c` is then printed as output.

### Evaluation of the Program's Correctness:
- **Maximizing `B - C`**: The strategy of adding the largest remaining numbers to `b` and the smallest to `c` effectively maximizes `B - C`. By placing larger values in `b`, the program ensures that the difference between sums is as large as possible.

- **Covering All Cases**: The approach of alternating the sums based on the sorted list effectively covers all elements, ensuring that every possible number from the input contributes to either `b` or `c` without leaving any out.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the requirements set out by the problem description. It calculates the maximum possible value of `B - C` by utilizing a partition strategy based on sorting the integers and then distributing them based on index parity.

Thus, the verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
