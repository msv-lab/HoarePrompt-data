Correctness: **True**

The program satisfies the requirements of the problem description through the following reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It assumes the input will be valid and fits within the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

2. **Sorting:** It sorts the list `a` in descending order. This is a strategic step because to maximize the difference `B - C`, it is beneficial to first choose the largest available numbers for sequence `b`.

3. **Partitioning Logic:** The program partitions the numbers into two sequences `b` and `c` based on the index of the sorted list:
   - Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are added to `b`.
   - Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are added to `c`.
   This alternating selection optimally contributes to maximizing `B`, as the larger numbers (which are sorted first) fill `b` more heavily than `c`, thus maximizing the difference `B - C`.

4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the result of `b - c`.

The program functions correctly under all possible constraints defined in the problem description. It considers both positive and negative integers, ensures every element of `a` is included in either `b` or `c`, and correctly computes the maximum possible value of `B - C` for any valid input sequence.

Moreover, it handles edge cases (e.g., all numbers negative, mixtures of positive and negative numbers, or different configurations of even and odd counts in the partition) effectively due to the way `b` and `c` are constructed based on the sorted list.

Thus, the approach used reinforces that the program is:
- Efficient (runs in O(n log n) due to sorting).
- Correct in logic to achieve the goal laid out in the problem description.

Therefore, the output of the program meets the requirements, confirming its correctness.
