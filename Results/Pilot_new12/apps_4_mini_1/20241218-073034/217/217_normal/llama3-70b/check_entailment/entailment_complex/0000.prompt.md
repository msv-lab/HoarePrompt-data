You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range of -100 to 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b, c = 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `b` is the sum of all elements at even indices of `a`, and `c` is the sum of all elements at odd indices of `a`.
    print(b - c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user input. It then sorts the list in descending order and calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (stored in variable `b`) and the sum of the integers at odd indices (stored in variable `c`). Finally, it prints the result of the subtraction `b - c`. The function operates under the constraints that `n` is between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list can range from -100 to 100. The function does not return any value but outputs the computed difference. Edge cases that could arise include handling lists where all numbers are negative or positive, as well as scenarios where the counts of odd and even indexed elements differ (for instance, when `n` is odd).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
