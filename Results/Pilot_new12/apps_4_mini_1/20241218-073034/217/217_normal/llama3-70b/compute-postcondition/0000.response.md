The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user within the range of 1 to 100. The list `a` remains unaffected and still contains `n` integers, each in the range of -100 to 100. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range of -100 to 100, and `n` is updated to an input integer.**
