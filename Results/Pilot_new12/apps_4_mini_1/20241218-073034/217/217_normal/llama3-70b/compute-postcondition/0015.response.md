In the given code snippet, `b` is updated to be equal to `b + a[i]`. The conditions implied by the initial state specify that `i` is an even integer and in the range governed by `n`, which is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. 

Since `i` is initially an even integer, it implies that there is a valid index `i` where `0 ≤ i < n`. The list `a` contains integers and is sorted in reverse order. The value `b` will increase by the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is even.

Therefore, we calculate `b`:

- `b` becomes `b + a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the specific integer in the list at index `i`.

The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `i` is an even integer; `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, where `i` is even and less than `n`.**
