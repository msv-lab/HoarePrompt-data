`c` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is an odd integer, and `i + 1` is even and less than `n`, it ensures that `i` is a valid index for the list `a`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The value of `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `i` is an odd integer, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`.**
