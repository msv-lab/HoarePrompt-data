Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; if `i` is even, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]` and `i` remains even and less than `n`. Otherwise, if `i` is odd, `b` remains the same, and `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, where `i` is an even integer and less than `n`.***
