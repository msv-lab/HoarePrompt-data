`c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, but since `i` must be an even integer, we can infer that this operation applies to the case when `i` is even, and keeps `c` unaltered if `i` is odd. Therefore, since `i` is already an even integer as stated in the initial conditions, we update `c` to include the value from the list `a`. The exact change to `c` depends on which value of `i` we're taking from `a`. The possible states of the variables after this operation remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `i` is an even integer; `b` remains the same; `c` is updated to `c + a[i]` where `i` is even and less than `n`.**
