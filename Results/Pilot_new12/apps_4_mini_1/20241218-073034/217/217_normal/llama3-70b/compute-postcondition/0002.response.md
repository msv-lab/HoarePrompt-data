After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is sorted in reverse order (i.e., from highest to lowest). The value of `n`, which represents the number of integers in the list, remains unchanged. As the specific elements of `a` were not defined in the input, we only know that they are integers within the specified range. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated state of `a` while retaining the existing conditions for `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers now sorted in reverse order (from highest to lowest).**
