The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is in the range of -100 to 100. The functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in the given output, so no return cases can be determined from the information provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each in the range of -100 to 100).**
