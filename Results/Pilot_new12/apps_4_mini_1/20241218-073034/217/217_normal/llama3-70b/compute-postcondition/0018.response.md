The loop alternates adding elements from the list `a` to either `b` or `c` based on whether the index `i` is even or odd. Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop will execute `n` times. 

1. If `n` is odd, the last iteration will have an odd index, causing the last element in `a` to be added to `c`.
2. If `n` is even, the last iteration will have an even index, causing the last element in `a` to be added to `b`.

As a result, after all iterations:

- `b` will contain the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of `a`.
- `c` will contain the sum of elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) of `a`.

Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order:

- If `n` is even, `b` will hold the sum of the first half of the list and `c` will hold the sum of the second half.
- If `n` is odd, `b` will still hold the sum of the first half plus the middle element, while `c` will hold the sum of the remaining elements.

Therefore, the final values of `b` and `c` will depend on the values within the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `b` is the sum of all elements at even indices of `a`, and `c` is the sum of all elements at odd indices of `a`.**
