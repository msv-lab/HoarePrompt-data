According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The loop will use `i` that will start from 0 and will go up to `n-1`.

Before the loop starts, we have the following:
- `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, which ensures the loop can execute.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order.
- `b` is 0.
- `c` is 0.

There is no need for adjustments on the states `b` and `c`, since their values do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. However, `i` must be initialized by the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
