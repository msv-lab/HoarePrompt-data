The statement `b += a[i]` indicates that the value of `a[i]` will be added to the current value of `b`. Given that `i` is an odd integer, `i + 1` is an even integer, which ensures that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `a` since `0 ≤ i < n`. 

The value of `n` is within the range 1 to 100, and the list `a` contains `n` integers sorted in reverse order. This means that `a[i]` will be valid and corresponds to an element in the sorted list. The updated value of `b` will depend on the specific value of `a[i]`, which is unknown but is a valid integer from the list.

No other variables are affected in this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in reverse order; `i` is an odd integer; `b` is updated to be equal to `b + a[i]`.**
