The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) where \( B \) is the sum of positive integers and \( C \) is the sum of negative integers from the input list. 

To break it down:

1. The function reads \( n \), the number of integers, and then reads the sequence \( a \).
2. It computes \( B \), the sum of all positive integers in \( a \), effectively collecting all positive contributions.
3. It computes \( C \), the sum of all negative integers in \( a \), which correctly accounts for the total negative contributions.
4. The formula \( B - C \) is appropriately used since substracting a negative number is equivalent to addition. This means that the result will indeed be the maximum possible value of \( B - C \).

Evaluating the function with the provided output hints:
- The function handles cases where there are no positive or no negative numbers correctly, as it will either return a total of only positive sums or return 0 if there are no positive integers (this is inherently correct).
- When all numbers are positive or when they are both positive and negative, the handling is correct, as the sum of negative numbers will just add negatively to the total result.

Furthermore, examining different potential inputs shows that the function behaves as expected in all provided scenarios. For example:
- For the input `3` followed by `1 -2 0`, `B` would be `1` and `C` would be `-2`, leading to a result of `3`.
- For the input `6` followed by `16 23 16 15 42 8`, `B` would be `120` and `C` would be `0`, leading to a result of `120`.

The output hints confirm that the code achieves the goals set out in the problem description without missing any edge cases or special conditions that would alter results.

Therefore, the program is indeed correct as per the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
