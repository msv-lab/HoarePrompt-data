Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Understanding B and C:** The program computes \( B \) as the sum of all positive integers in the input list \( a \) and \( C \) as the sum of all negative integers. This aligns with the problem's requirement to partition the sequence into two groups, as every positive integer can go into sequence \( b \) and every negative integer into sequence \( c \).

2. **Calculation of \( B - C \):** The formula for the difference \( B - C \) is correctly implemented. The program calculates this difference and prints it, which is exactly what the problem asks.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:** The hint mentions that the program will output `0` if both sums are equal or if all numbers are of the same sign. In cases where there are no positive numbers, \( B \) will be \( 0 \), and if there are positive and negative numbers contributing to the sums, the calculation will still hold true. The problem states that if either sequence \( b \) or \( c \) is empty, its sum is considered \( 0 \), which is inherently managed by the way \( B \) and \( C \) are calculated.

4. **Validity of Input:** As per the assumption, the input will be valid. The function is expected to handle cases from \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 100 \) and integers in the range of \(-100\) to \(100\). There are no indications of cases where the input can break the implemented logic.

Therefore, since the program meets the requirements defined in the problem description and handles all specified cases without missing logic or edge cases, I conclude that the program is correct.
