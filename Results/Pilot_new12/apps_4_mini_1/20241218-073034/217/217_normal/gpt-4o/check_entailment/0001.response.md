Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) based on the given problem description. Here's why the program works as intended:

- It reads the integer \( n \), which represents the number of elements in the sequence.
- It reads the sequence of integers \( a \).
- The program computes \( B \) as the sum of all positive integers in the sequence.
- It computes \( C \) as the sum of all negative integers in the sequence.
- The calculation \( B - C \) translates to the sum of positive integers minus the sum of negative integers, effectively treating the negative integers as contributing positively to the result (since subtracting a negative is adding its absolute value).
- Finally, it prints the result.

To further elaborate, the edge cases such as all integers being positive, all being negative, and a mix are all correctly handled by the method of summation used. The program correctly returns 0 for empty sequences (though the input constraints ensure thereâ€™s at least one integer).

Given these considerations, no inputs have been identified where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem, thus confirming the program's correctness.
