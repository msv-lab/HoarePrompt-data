You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's consider how the program is structured and what the requirements are:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We're given a list of integers.
- We need to find two subsequences, \( b \) and \( c \), such that:
  - The sum \( B \) of elements in \( b \) is maximized.
  - The sum \( C \) of elements in \( c \) is minimized.
- Finally, we need to compute the maximum possible value of \( B - C \).

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)
```

1. **Positive numbers**: The program correctly sums all positive integers into \( B \) since those contribute positively to the final result.
2. **Negative numbers**: The program sums the negative integers into \( C \). However, since \( C \) should be the sum of elements in sequence \( c \), this means it is intended that \( B - C \) becomes \( B + |C| \) (where \( |C| \) is the absolute value of the sum of negative numbers).
3. **Zero**: The program does not aim to include zero in either \( b \) or \( c \). That's acceptable since zero does not contribute to either sum positively or negatively.

### Possible Issues:
- When \( n = 1 \) and the input is a non-positive number (specifically, negative or zero), the program does not consider partitioning in an optimal way. For example:

**Test Case Example:**
Input:
```
1
-5
```
- Expected output:
  \( B = 0 \) (as no positive numbers exist), \( C = -5 \) (taking the negative number),
  Hence, \( B - C = 0 - (-5) = 5 \).
  
However, the code will output:
```
B = 0
C = -5
result = 0 - (-5) = 5
```
This case would technically work, but let's consider other combinations. 

Another edge case:
Input:
```
4
-1 -1 -1 -1
```
- Expected output:
  \( B = 0 \), \( C = -4 \),
  So, \( B - C = 0 - (-4) = 4 \).
  
In all cases, the program seems to correctly handle the situation by the definition provided. 

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the program based on the description, it appears that it correctly calculates the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) for all varieties of input according to the rules outlined in the problem. It includes all positive numbers in \( B \) and appropriately handles the negative contributions to \( C \). 

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the sequence, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} where each integer satisfies -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that represents the number of integers in a sequence, followed by reading a list of `n` integers (each within the range -100 to 100). It computes the sum of all positive integers in the list, denoted as `B`, and the sum of all negative integers, denoted as `C`. The function then calculates the difference `result = B - C` and prints this result. It does not handle cases where no positive or no negative numbers are present separately, but it will output `0` if both sums are equal or if all numbers are of the same sign. The function assumes valid input according to the specified constraints, but there are no checks for input errors or cases where the input is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
