The value of `n` is assigned based on the input, which represents the number of elements in the sequence. The restrictions on `n` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, indicating it must be a whole number within that range. The values of the sequence (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this line, as they depend on user input that occurs separately and hasn’t been processed yet. Therefore, no other variables alter as a result of this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet defined.**
