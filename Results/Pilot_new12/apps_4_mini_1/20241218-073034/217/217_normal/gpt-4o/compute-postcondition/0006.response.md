The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the sequence (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}`, where each integer satisfies -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100. The function processes this input and returns an output based on the elements of the list. However, the specific output behavior is not described here. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n representing the number of elements in a sequence and a list of n integers where each integer is between -100 and 100. The specific output produced based on these inputs is not described.**
