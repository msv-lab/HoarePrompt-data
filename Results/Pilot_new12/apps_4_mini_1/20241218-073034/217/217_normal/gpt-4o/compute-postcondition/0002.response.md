The variable `B` is assigned the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`. Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, the list `a` contains `n` integers. The specific value of `B` will depend on the sum of all positive integers present in `a`. Other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`.**
