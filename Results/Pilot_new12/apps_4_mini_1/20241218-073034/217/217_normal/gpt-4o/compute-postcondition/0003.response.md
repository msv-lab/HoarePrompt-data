The value of `C` is assigned the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`. The conditions state that `a` consists of `n` integers with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, which means `B` captures the sum of positive integers, while `C` focuses only on the negative integers, if any. Since `C` is derived from the elements of `a`, its specific value depends on the list's content.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input; `B` is the sum of positive integers in `a`; `C` is the sum of negative integers in `a`.**
