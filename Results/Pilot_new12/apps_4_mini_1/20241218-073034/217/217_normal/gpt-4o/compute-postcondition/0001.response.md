`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping integers from the input split into individual strings. The initial state defines that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet defined. The values of `a` will be based on user input. Therefore, `a` will hold a list of integers of length `n` if the input is provided correctly.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input.**
