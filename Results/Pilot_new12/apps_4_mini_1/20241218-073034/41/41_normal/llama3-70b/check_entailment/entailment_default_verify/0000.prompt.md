You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Understanding the Problem

We need to classify the outcome of a coding round based on the participants' ratings before and after the round:
1. **"rated"** - If at least one participant's rating has changed (i.e., at least one \( a_i \neq b_i \)).
2. **"unrated"** - If no ratings have changed and there exists at least one instance where a participant with a lower initial rating finishes better than a participant with a higher initial rating.
3. **"maybe"** - If no ratings have changed and no contradictions in rating positions exist (participants maintained their relative positions).

### Evaluating the Code

1. The code begins by reading the number of participants and their respective ratings before and after the round.
2. Two lists collect the ratings: `ratings_before` for before the round and `ratings_after` for after.
3. The first loop checks whether there is a contradiction in rankings:
   - It looks for any participant ranked higher (i.e., a lower index) who has a lower rating than a participant ranked lower (i.e., a higher index).
   - If such a contradiction exists, `unrated` is set to False.
4. The second loop checks if any ratings have changed. If so, it sets `rated` to True.
5. Finally, the code prints:
   - "rated" if any rating has changed.
   - "unrated" if there are no rating changes and contradictions in order are found.
   - "maybe" if neither condition applies.

### Finding Edge Cases

To validate the program against edge cases, let's consider the following scenarios:

1. **Case where ratings change**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     2000 2100
     1800 1800
     ```
   - Expected Output: "rated"
   - The program would output "rated" correctly.

2. **Case where no change, but a contradiction exists**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     3000 3000
     2500 2500
     2700 2700
     ```
   - Expected Output: "unrated"
   - As there are no rating changes, if arranged as in the input, this output is correct.

3. **Case where no changes and no contradictions**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     3000 3000
     2800 2800
     2500 2500
     ```
   - Expected Output: "maybe"
   - This scenario has no changes and follows the ranking appropriately, which means the program should output "maybe".

### Identified Problem in the Program

However, there's an oversight in how it detects contradictions:
- The check for contradictions only looks at pairs but doesn't appropriately check if `unrated` should be set to true or false based on the entire rankings in one go.
- Specifically, the use of a nested loop to check rankings can be inefficient and may lead to incorrect setting of `unrated`.

### Conclusion

Due to the correctly implemented logic for determining when the ratings have changed and the necessary checks for contradictions, but since the logic fails to handle rank contradictions properly and results may vary based on input, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of participants, and then collects each participant's ratings before and after an event through user input. It stores these ratings in two lists: `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. The function then checks for discrepancies between the before and after ratings. If any participant's after rating does not match their before rating, it outputs 'rated'. If all ratings are the same, it outputs 'unrated'. If there is a condition where one participant's before rating is less than another's but their after rating is greater, it indicates uncertainty in rating and outputs 'maybe'. Therefore, the final output can be 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe' based on the comparisons made. The function also does not handle any input errors or invalid cases (e.g., non-integer inputs), which could lead to runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
