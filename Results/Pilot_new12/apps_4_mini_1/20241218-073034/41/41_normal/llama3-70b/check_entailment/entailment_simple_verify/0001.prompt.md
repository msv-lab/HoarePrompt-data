You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----
Input
6
3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program's correctness based on the problem description, we can walk through the logic of the code and examine potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Inputs**: The program reads the number of participants `n` and then reads pairs of ratings (before and after the round) for each participant.

2. **Logic for Judging Rated/Unrated/Maybe**:
   - It adds the before ratings and after ratings into separate lists.
   - It checks for conditions related to "unrated". The logic here seems flawed since it uses a nested loop that compares ratings incorrectly.
   - Finally, it checks if any participant's rating has changed (`ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]`). If so, the round is considered "rated".

### Flaw in Logic:
The way the program determines whether the round is "maybe" or "unrated" is incorrect. Specifically:
- The criteria specified in the problem state that if no ratings changed and a participant with a lower rating beats a participant with a higher rating, it must imply "unrated". However, the implementation does not check for this condition properly.
- The handling of determining whether the round is "maybe" fails because there's no correct handling of "unrated" cases in conjunction with the sorted standings.
  
### Potential Edge Case:
If we provide the following input as a test case:

```
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400
```

Expected Output: `unrated`
- In this case, since participant 4 has a higher rating than participant 2, but participant 4 ranks lower in the standings, the output should be "unrated". The logic you have for determining unrated cases does not correctly validate this condition as required by the problem's description.

### Conclusion:
Due to the flaws in the logic of determining whether the round is rated, unrated, or maybe, based on edge cases provided and the mismatch between requirements and implementation, we can confirm:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

            rated = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `rated` is True if there is at least one index `i` where `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, otherwise `rated` remains False; `unrated` depends on the values compared, but if all ratings are the same, `unrated` is True.

        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`rated` is False and `unrated` is True, meaning there are no discrepancies between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `unrated` is True, the function acknowledges that all ratings are the same. If `unrated` is False, it indicates that 'maybe' has been printed while maintaining that `rated` is still False.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If `rated` is True, the output 'rated' has been printed, and `unrated` can be either True or False depending on the comparison of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `rated` is False and `unrated` is True, there are no discrepancies between the ratings, meaning all ratings are the same. In this case, if `unrated` is False, 'maybe' has been printed while maintaining that `rated` is still False.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
