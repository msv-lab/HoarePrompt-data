According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means that it is ready to move to the next iteration, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `n` is at least 2, there are still valid iterations remaining. However, for the loop to execute one more time after the current state, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, at the beginning of the next execution, it needs to be ensured that `n` is greater than 2, so that `i` (which will be 2) allows the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2**
