The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]`, `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
