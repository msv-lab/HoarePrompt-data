The code snippet prints the string `'unrated'`, which does not affect the values of the variables `rated` and `unrated`. The initial state confirms that `unrated` is True, and since there are no changes to the state of the other variables, the output remains the same after executing the code. 

Output State: **`rated` is False, `unrated` is True**
