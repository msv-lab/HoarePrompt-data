The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The precondition states that `unrated` was originally `True`, so this value has changed. The other variables remain unchanged, so we will maintain their information.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `unrated` is False. The value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]`, and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`.**
