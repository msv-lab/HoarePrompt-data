The `break` statement is executed, which causes the loop or the most inner control structure to terminate immediately. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and there is no modification to their states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` remains True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
