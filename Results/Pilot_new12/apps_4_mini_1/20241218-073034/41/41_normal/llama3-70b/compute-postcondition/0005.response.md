The code `ratings_before.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. Since `ratings_before` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `ratings_before` will contain the value of `a`.

The states of other variables (`n`, `ratings_after`, `b`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the value of `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the value of `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input**.
