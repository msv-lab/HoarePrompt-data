According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop iterates for `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n`. If `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 2, the next value of `j` will be 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. If `j` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 in order for `j` to be able to increment to the next value. If `j` increments by 1, the next value for `j` will be 3.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time:
- `i` remains 1,
- `j` becomes 3 in the next iteration,
- `n` must be greater than 3 to allow `j` to be within the loop range.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
