The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The initial state remains valid, but the program flow is altered by the `break` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
