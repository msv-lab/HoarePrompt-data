Postcondition: ***`rated` is False and `unrated` is True, meaning there are no discrepancies between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `unrated` is True, the function acknowledges that all ratings are the same. If `unrated` is False, it indicates that 'maybe' has been printed while maintaining that `rated` is still False.***
