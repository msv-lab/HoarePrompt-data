`unrated` is assigned the value of `False`, which matches the initial state since `n` must be greater than 5. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `unrated` are consistent with the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `unrated` is False.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `unrated` is False**
