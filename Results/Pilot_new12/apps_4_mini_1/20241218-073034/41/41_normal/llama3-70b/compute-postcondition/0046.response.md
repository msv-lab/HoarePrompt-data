Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, if `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the control flow continues without any changes.***
