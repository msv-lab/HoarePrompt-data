According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `n`, which can range from 2 to 1000 as specified. It is guaranteed that `n` is at least 2, so the loop will execute at least twice. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.

Since the loop is set to iterate `n` times, we initially need to adjust the states associated with `i`. At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 and ready to iterate through the range of `n`.

The other states `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `a`, `b`, `rated`, and `unrated` do not need adjustments specifically for the loop to execute; rather, they are simply contextually relevant to the operations that take place within the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**
