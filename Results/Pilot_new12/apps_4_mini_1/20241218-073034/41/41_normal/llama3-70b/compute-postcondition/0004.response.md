The code snippet uses `map(int, input().split())` to read two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variables `n`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` will depend on the user input, but they will be integers as per the code's functionality.

Since `a` and `b` are new variables introduced by the code, and their specific values will be determined by the user's input, we can summarize the output state with that in mind.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input.**
