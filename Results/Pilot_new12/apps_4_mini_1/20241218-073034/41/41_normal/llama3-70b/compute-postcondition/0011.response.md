According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than the current iteration count (which is represented by `_`), the loop can execute again. In Python, the loop will execute `n` times starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

Since `n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, we need to consider that if the loop has executed previously, `_` will have reached its current maximum iteration number. If it were to execute again, the iteration count increases by 1. 

Therefore, since the loop executes `n` times, and assuming this is the last iteration (i.e., the current value of `_` is `n - 1`), to execute one more time (the next iteration would be `_` being `n`), `n` must remain at least `n` after the previous iteration. 

If the loop has executed `n` times, then on the next iteration `_` would be `n` which is the termination condition. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to remain within the valid bounds, which confirms that `n` is still ≤ 1000.

State: **`n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` now contains the previous values plus `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing the value of `b` plus the previous contents of `ratings_after;` `_` is n**
