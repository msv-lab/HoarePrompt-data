The code assigns `False` to `unrated`. The previous value of `unrated` was `True`, so now it changes to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `unrated` is False**.
