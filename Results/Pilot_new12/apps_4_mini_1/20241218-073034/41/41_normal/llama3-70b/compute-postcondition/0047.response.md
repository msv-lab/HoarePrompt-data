According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Since `n` is greater than 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 4 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`, which is currently known to be greater than 3, so it will execute again with `j` equal to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
