According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times as long as `n` is a valid integer within the given range of 2 to 1000. Since `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists, their states do not influence the execution of the loop. 

At the beginning of the loop, the loop variable is represented by an underscore `_`, which is a common convention indicating that the variable is not used within the loop body. This means there are no specific values or adjustments required for it.

To summarize, for the loop to execute properly, `n` must be within the specified range. The values in the empty lists do not affect the condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list**
