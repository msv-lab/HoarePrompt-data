The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state of `ratings_before` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing the value of `b`. The previous values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are updated to reflect the values of `a` and `b`. The values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` will now be `[a]` and `[b]` respectively.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is now a list containing the value of `a`, `ratings_after` is now a list containing the value of `b`.**
