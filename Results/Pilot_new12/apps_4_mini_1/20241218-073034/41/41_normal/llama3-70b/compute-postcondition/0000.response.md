The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `int(input())`, which interprets user input as an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 1000. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000, and now `n` is an input integer within that range.**
