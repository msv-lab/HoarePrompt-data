Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of participants, and then collects each participant's ratings before and after an event through user input. It stores these ratings in two lists: `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. The function then checks for discrepancies between the before and after ratings. If any participant's after rating does not match their before rating, it outputs 'rated'. If all ratings are the same, it outputs 'unrated'. If there is a condition where one participant's before rating is less than another's but their after rating is greater, it indicates uncertainty in rating and outputs 'maybe'. Therefore, the final output can be 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe' based on the comparisons made. The function also does not handle any input errors or invalid cases (e.g., non-integer inputs), which could lead to runtime errors.**
