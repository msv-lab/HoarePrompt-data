`ratings_after` now includes the value of `b`, which is appended to the previously empty list. The values of `n`, `ratings_before`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing the value of `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing the value of `b`; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is a list containing the value of `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing the value of `b`; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input.**
