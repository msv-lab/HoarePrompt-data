Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
