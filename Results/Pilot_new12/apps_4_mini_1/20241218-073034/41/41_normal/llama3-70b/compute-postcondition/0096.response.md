Postcondition: ***If `rated` is True, the output 'rated' has been printed, and `unrated` can be either True or False depending on the comparison of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`. If `rated` is False and `unrated` is True, there are no discrepancies between the ratings, meaning all ratings are the same. In this case, if `unrated` is False, 'maybe' has been printed while maintaining that `rated` is still False.***
