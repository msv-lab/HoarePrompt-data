According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1`, which is 2 in this case (`i` is 1). For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, if `n` is 2, the loop will not execute because `j` would equal `n` after the first iteration (as `j` starts at 2). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Specifically, it must be at least 3. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to 2 (the value of `i + 1`).

In summary, for the loop to execute, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. `n` must be greater than 2.
2. `j` starts as 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
