`ratings_before` is a list that will have `a` appended to it. The initial constraints on `n` remain unchanged as they do not interact with the operation being performed. The variable `ratings_before` now contains its previous elements along with the new element `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` now contains the previous values plus `a`; `ratings_after` is still a list containing the value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` now contains the previous values plus `a`; `ratings_after` is still a list containing the value of `b`.**
