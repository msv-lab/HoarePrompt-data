Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` remains True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, and `j` is `n`. If `unrated` is False, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining that `unrated` has been switched to True in the iteration.***
