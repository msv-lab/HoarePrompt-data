Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` holds true, then `unrated` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
