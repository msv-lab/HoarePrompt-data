The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
