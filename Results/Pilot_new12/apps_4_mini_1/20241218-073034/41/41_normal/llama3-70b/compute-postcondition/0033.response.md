Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is either True or False (depending on the conditions within the loop), `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, if at least one `j` exists such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` will be False. If the loop does not execute, `unrated` remains True and `j` will not be updated.**
