The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from the user input using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes two integers from the input. The values of `a` and `b` are now defined by the user's input, but the specific values and conditions of `n`, `ratings_before`, and `ratings_after` remain unaffected. Therefore, their states are preserved.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains the previous values plus `a`; `ratings_after` is a list containing the value of `b` plus the previous contents of `ratings_after;` `a` is the integer from input; `b` is the integer from input.**
