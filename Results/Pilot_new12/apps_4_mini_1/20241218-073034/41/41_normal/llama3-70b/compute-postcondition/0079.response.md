According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since `n` is within the range 2 to 1000, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 1. Thus, when the loop executes again, `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1**
