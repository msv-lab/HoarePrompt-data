Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1; if the rating at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the rating at index `j` in `ratings_before` and the rating at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the rating at index `j` in `ratings_after`, then `rated` is set to False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
