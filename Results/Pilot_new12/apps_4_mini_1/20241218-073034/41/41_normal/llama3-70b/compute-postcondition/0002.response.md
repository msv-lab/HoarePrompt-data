The variable `ratings_after` is assigned an empty list, which does not affect the value of `n` or the state of `ratings_before`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list.**
