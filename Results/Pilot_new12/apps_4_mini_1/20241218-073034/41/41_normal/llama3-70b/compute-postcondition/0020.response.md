To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved and their current values:

1. The loop starts with `j` taking the values from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, the loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `n`.

2. With `i` being 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` will start from 1 and go up to `n - 1`. As long as `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute at least once with `j` being 1.

3. It is important to ensure that the loop can properly utilize any necessary variables or structures inside the body (which are not detailed here). However, since the focus is on the pre-loop state, we'll concentrate on the start conditions for `j`.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly:

- `j` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts (since `i` is 0).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure there's at least one valid index for `j`.

Based on this analysis, here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is True, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
