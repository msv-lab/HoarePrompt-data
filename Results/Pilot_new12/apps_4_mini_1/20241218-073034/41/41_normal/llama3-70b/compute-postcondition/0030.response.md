The variable `unrated` is explicitly set to `False`. Since it was already `False` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the previous values of the other variables remain the same as well.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` integer values, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` integer values, `a` is the last integer input, `b` is the last integer input, `rated` is False, `unrated` is False, `maybe` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 3.**
