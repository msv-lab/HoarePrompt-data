The code `ratings_after.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. The previous values in `ratings_after` remain unchanged, and only the new value `b` is added to it. The state of the other variables remains valid without change.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` contains the previous values plus `a`; `ratings_after` now contains its previous values plus `b`; `a` is the integer from input; `b` is the integer from input.**
