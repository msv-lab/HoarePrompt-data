The `ratings_before` list is assigned the value of itself with the addition of the integer `a`. The initial state indicates that `ratings_before` originally contains previous values, and now it will include `a`. The other variables, including `n`, `ratings_after`, and `b`, are unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` now contains the previous values plus `a`; `ratings_after` remains unchanged; `a` is the integer from input; `b` is the integer from input.**
