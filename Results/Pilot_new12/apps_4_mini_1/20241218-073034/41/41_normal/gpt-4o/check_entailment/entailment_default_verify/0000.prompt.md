You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----
Input
6
3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings.append((a, b))
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
    if not is_rated:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
    if is_rated:
        print('rated')
    elif is_unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func()` in relation to the problem description.

1. The function begins by reading an integer `n`, which is the number of participants.
2. It initializes two boolean flags: `is_rated` and `is_unrated`.
3. The loop reads the ratings before and after the round for each participant and checks if any participant's ratings have changed (i.e., if `a != b`). If so, it sets `is_rated` to `True`.
4. If all ratings are unchanged (`is_rated` is still `False`), it checks the order of the ratings. It looks for any cases where a participant with a lower rating ranks higher than one with a higher rating (`ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]`).
   - If such a case is found, it sets `is_unrated` to `True` and breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it prints:
   - "rated" if `is_rated` is `True`.
   - "unrated" if `is_unrated` is `True`.
   - "maybe" if neither flag is set to `True`.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
Let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Case with all participants rated the same and ordered correctly**: 
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    2000 2000
    2000 2000
    2000 2000
    ```
  - Expected output: "maybe"
  - Actual output: "maybe"
  
- **Case where one participant's rating changes**: 
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    3000 3000
    2500 2600
    2700 2700
    ```
  - Expected output: "rated"
  - Actual output: "rated"

- **Case with ratings not in order but unchanged ratings**:
  - Input:
    ```
    4
    1500 1500
    1600 1600
    1400 1400
    1300 1300
    ```
  - Expected output: "unrated" (because the second participant has a higher rating than the first and ranks below)
  - Actual output: "unrated"

### Edge Case where the logic does not hold
- **Edge case with strict rankings but same ratings**:
    - Input:
    ```
    3
    3000 3000
    2000 2000
    1000 1000
    ```
    - Expected output: "maybe" (the rankings are correct, no ratings changed)
    - Actual output: "maybe"

### Conclusion
The program appears to be handling all expected scenarios correctly. The logic checks for changes adequately and verifies order under the premise of ratings being unchanged. After analyzing potential cases, I find no inconsistencies or cases where the program fails. 

Thus, I conclude that the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of participants and their ratings before and after a round, stored as tuples in a list. It determines if at least one participant's rating has changed (is rated) or if the ratings are in a potential unrated state. If any participant has a different rating before and after the round, it prints 'rated'. If not, it checks if the ratings are strictly increasing; if they are, it prints 'unrated'. If the ratings are not rated and do not follow a strictly increasing order, it prints 'maybe'. The function effectively analyzes the state of the ratings and outputs one of three possible results: 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe'. Additionally, the function does not handle any invalid input scenarios, such as if the input integers exceed the specified ranges or if non-integer values are provided, indicating a potential edge case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
