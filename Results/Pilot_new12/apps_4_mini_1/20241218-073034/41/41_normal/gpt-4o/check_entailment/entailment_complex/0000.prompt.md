You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input

3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 2 and 1000, and for each participant, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126, where a_i is the rating before the round and b_i is the rating after the round.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings.append((a, b))
        
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers `(a_i, b_i)` given as input, `is_rated` is True if at least one pair `(a_i, b_i)` exists where `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`, and `is_unrated` remains False.
    if (not is_rated) :
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `is_unrated` is True if there exists at least one `i` such that `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` within the range of the ratings; otherwise, `is_unrated` is False. `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. If `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is set to True if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]`; otherwise, `is_unrated` is set to False.
    if is_rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if is_unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is False, and `is_unrated` is True. If `is_unrated` is true, the output 'unrated' has been printed. Otherwise, the output 'maybe' has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. If `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` remains unchanged, and the output is 'rated'. If `is_rated` is False, then if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]`, `is_unrated` is set to True and the output is 'unrated'; otherwise, `is_unrated` is set to False and the output is 'maybe'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of participants and their ratings before and after a round, stored as tuples in a list. It determines if at least one participant's rating has changed (is rated) or if the ratings are in a potential unrated state. If any participant has a different rating before and after the round, it prints 'rated'. If not, it checks if the ratings are strictly increasing; if they are, it prints 'unrated'. If the ratings are not rated and do not follow a strictly increasing order, it prints 'maybe'. The function effectively analyzes the state of the ratings and outputs one of three possible results: 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe'. Additionally, the function does not handle any invalid input scenarios, such as if the input integers exceed the specified ranges or if non-integer values are provided, indicating a potential edge case.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
