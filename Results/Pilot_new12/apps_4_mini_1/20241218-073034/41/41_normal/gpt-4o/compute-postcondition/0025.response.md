The code is a `break` statement, which means it immediately exits the closest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, while the values of the variables remain unchanged, the execution flow will exit from whatever loop or conditional statement is currently being processed. Therefore, the output state will reflect that no variables have changed, but that we have broken out of a construct.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `ratings[i - 1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]`, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
