The code retrieves two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The previous state indicates that `a` and `b` are input integers, and we need to check if they are equal or not. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the states of `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` will change or remain unchanged.

If `a` is not equal to `b`, `ratings` will contain the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` will be set to True, and `is_unrated` will remain False. If `a` is equal to `b`, the state regarding `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` after input is taken.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 999, `a` and `b` are input integers; if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` contains the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False; if `a` is equal to `b`, the state remains unchanged.**
