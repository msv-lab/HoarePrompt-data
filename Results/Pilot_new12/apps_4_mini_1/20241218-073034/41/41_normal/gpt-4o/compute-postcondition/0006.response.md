The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The initial states of `n`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged. The variable `ratings` will now contain the tuple `(a, b)` alongside any values it already held (which was empty initially).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` is defined for iteration, `b_i` is defined for iteration, `ratings` is now a list containing the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False**.
