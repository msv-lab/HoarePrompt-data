According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times based on the integer `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and the loop has executed some of those times. Since we want the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state accordingly. The variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) won't affect the states required for the next iteration.

Since `n` must be reduced by 1 to account for the upcoming iteration and we want the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `n` must be greater than 1. The value of `n` thus will decrease by 1 as the loop executes sequentially.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 999, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` contains the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is set to True, and `is_unrated` remains False; if `a` is equal to `b`, the state regarding `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remains unchanged.**
