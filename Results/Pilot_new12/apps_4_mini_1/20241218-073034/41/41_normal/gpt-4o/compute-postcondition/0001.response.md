The `ratings` variable is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a_i`, or `b_i`, which remain within their specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of those variables alongside the new state of `ratings`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list.**
