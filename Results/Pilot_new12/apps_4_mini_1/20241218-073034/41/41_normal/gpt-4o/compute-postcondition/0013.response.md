The value of `is_rated` is assigned `True`, which means the previous state where `is_rated` could have been either `True` or `False` is now confirmed as `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so `is_unrated` remains `False`, and the status of `ratings` will depend on the initial values of `a` and `b`, which is not strictly defined here.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 999; if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` contains the tuple `(a, b)`; `is_rated` is True; `is_unrated` is False; if `a` is equal to `b`, the state remains unchanged; `ratings` now includes the tuple `(a, b)` if `a` is not equal to `b`.**
