According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` being 1 and continues until `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, as the range starts from 1. 

The state of `ratings` does not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but we need to note that `i` will start from 1. Since `is_rated` is False, indicating that all pairs `(a_i, b_i)` are the same, we assume the loop interacts with `ratings` based on the tuples provided.

Thus, for the loop to be executed:

- `n` must be at least 2,
- `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
