According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and its relation to `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. 

Since `n` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Additionally, the expression `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will need to be evaluated. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
