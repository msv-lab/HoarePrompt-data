The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
