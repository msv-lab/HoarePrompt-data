Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. If `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` remains unchanged, and the output is 'rated'. If `is_rated` is False, then if there exists at least one index `i` such that `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]`, `is_unrated` is set to True and the output is 'unrated'; otherwise, `is_unrated` is set to False and the output is 'maybe'.***
