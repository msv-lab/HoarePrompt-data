The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `a_i`, `b_i`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` hold their respective definitions. The line of code provided takes user input for two integers split by space and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are being assigned through input, their exact numerical values will be provided during execution, but they will still fall within the general criteria of being integers. Other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` is defined for iteration, `b_i` is defined for iteration, `ratings` can remain an empty list, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False**
