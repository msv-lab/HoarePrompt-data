The variable `is_rated` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ratings` remain unchanged as the code only affects the value of `is_rated`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 999, `a` is an integer based on input, `b` is an integer based on input, `ratings` includes a new tuple containing `(a, b)`, and `is_rated` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 999, `a` is an integer based on input, `b` is an integer based on input, `ratings` includes a new tuple containing `(a, b)`, and `is_rated` is True.**
