The code `ratings.append((a, b))` adds a tuple containing `a` and `b` to the list `ratings`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers based on input, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 999. The operation does not change the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`, but it affects the state of `ratings` by appending a new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 999; `a` is an integer based on input; `b` is an integer based on input; `ratings` includes a new tuple containing `(a, b)`**.
