The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `False`, and there are no prior values or conditions being changed that affect the other variables. The values of `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `ratings`, and `is_rated` remain unchanged as there are no dependencies on `is_unrated`. Thus, the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False.**
