The variable `is_rated` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. The conditions regarding `a` and `b` hold that they are still input integers, and `is_rated` now reflects that ratings have been established. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` is defined for iteration, `b_i` is defined for iteration, `ratings` is now a list containing the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False.**
