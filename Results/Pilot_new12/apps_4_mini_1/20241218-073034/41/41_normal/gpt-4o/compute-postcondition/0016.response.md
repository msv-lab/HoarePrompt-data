`a` and `b` are assigned the values from input processed by `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input string into two parts and converts them into integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but now there are new integer variables `a` and `b` based on the provided input. The specific values of `a` and `b` depend on the actual input but are not constrained by any preconditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 999; `a` is an integer based on input; `b` is an integer based on input.**
