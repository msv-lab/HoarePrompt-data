The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and this condition remains valid. The states of the variables `a_i` and `b_i` are not impacted directly by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126.**
