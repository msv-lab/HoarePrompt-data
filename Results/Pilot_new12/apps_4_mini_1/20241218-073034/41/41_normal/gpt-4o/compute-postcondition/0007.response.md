Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` is defined for iteration, `b_i` is defined for iteration, `ratings` is now a list containing the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False. The current values of `a` and `b` are such that `a` is not equal to `b`.***
