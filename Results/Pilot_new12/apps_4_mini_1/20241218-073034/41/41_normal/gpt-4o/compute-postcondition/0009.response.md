Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `ratings` contains the tuple `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is set to True, and `is_unrated` remains False. If `a` is equal to `b`, the state regarding `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` is unchanged.***
