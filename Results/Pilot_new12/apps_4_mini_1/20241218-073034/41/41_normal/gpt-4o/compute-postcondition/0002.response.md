The variable `is_rated` is assigned the value `False`. This is the only change made in the code, and all other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False.**
