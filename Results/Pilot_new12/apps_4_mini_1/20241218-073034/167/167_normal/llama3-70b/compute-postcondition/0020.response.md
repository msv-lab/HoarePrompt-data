Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` (unused in the function body) and `y`, and processes a global list `a` of integers. It attempts to validate whether the sequence of integers in `a`, when mapped to a grid configuration defined by `y`, corresponds to a path that changes position in exactly one step for each consecutive integer in `a`. At the end of the function, it returns `True` if all integers in `a` comply with this rule, meaning the last integer can be reached from the previous one by moving one grid space; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not take into consideration the validity of `x` or any potential configurations when `a` is empty, nor does it handle cases where the integers in `a` are out of the bounds defined (though they should be as per the precondition). If the list `a` contains fewer than one element or if `y` is invalid for the given context (though this is not checked), it would still return `True` without executing the loop. This might not cover all edge cases thoroughly.**
