The code snippet `px, py = nx, ny` assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py`, respectively. The initial state notes that the function may return False if the `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1`, but in this snippet, execution occurs without that condition producing any effects (all operations take place only if the condition is true).

Since we have no details about `nx` and `ny`, other than the operation that assigns their values to `px` and `py`, we can note that the function does not return early nor modifies `n`, `a`, or `v`.

Thus, the output state updates only `px` and `py` with the new values based on `nx` and `ny`, while all other elements of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second element in the list `a`, `px` is equal to `nx`, `py` is equal to `ny`.**
