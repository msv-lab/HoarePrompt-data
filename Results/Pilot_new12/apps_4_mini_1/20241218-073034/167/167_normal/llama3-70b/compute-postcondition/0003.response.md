Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers containing at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in the list `a`, `nx` is calculated as (v - 1) // y, `ny` is calculated as (v - 1) % y. The absolute difference between `nx` and `px`, plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py`, is not equal to 1.***
