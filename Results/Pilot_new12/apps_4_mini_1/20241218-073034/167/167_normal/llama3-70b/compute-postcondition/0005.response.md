Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in the list `a`, `nx` is calculated as (v - 1) // y, `ny` is calculated as (v - 1) % y, and the condition (abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1) holds true.***
