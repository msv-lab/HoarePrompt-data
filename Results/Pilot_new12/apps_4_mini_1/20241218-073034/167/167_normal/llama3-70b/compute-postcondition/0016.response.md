The values of `px` and `py` are updated to be equal to `nx` and `ny`, respectively. The values of `nx` and `ny` are defined as `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y`, which depend on the value of `v` (the third element in list `a`) and `y`. The output state will reflect the changes made to `px` and `py`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements; `v` is the third element in the list `a`; `px` is equal to (v - 1) // y; `py` is equal to (v - 1) % y; `nx` is equal to (v - 1) // y; `ny` is equal to (v - 1) % y.**
