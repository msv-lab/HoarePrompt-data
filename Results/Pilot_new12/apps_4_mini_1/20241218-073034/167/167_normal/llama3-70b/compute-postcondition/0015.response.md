Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements; `v` is the third element in the list `a`; `px` is equal to `nx`; `py` is equal to `ny`; `nx` is equal to (v - 1) // y; `ny` is equal to (v - 1) % y. If the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
