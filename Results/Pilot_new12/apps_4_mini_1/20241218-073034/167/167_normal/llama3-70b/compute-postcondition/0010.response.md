Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 2 elements, and `v` is the second element in the list `a`. If the condition abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part in the code.***
