Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `px` is the last calculated value of `nx`, `py` is the last calculated value of `ny`, where `nx` and `ny` are obtained from the last element `v` in the list `a` as `nx` is calculated as (v - 1) // y and `ny` is calculated as (v - 1) % y; the loop executed `n` times.**
