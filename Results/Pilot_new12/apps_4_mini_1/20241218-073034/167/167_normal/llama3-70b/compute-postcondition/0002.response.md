To determine the output state, we will focus on the calculations made by the line of code provided, considering the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `v` corresponds to the first element in the list `a`. Since `a` must have at least 1 element, `v` will be equal to `a[0]`.
2. The calculations involve integer division and modulus operations, using a variable `y` which is not defined in the initial state; thus, `y` remains unspecified indicative of being any non-zero integer.

Now, we have the equation:
- `nx = (v - 1) // y`
- `ny = (v - 1) % y`

Given `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `v` is therefore an integer value equal to `a[0]`. The calculations will directly depend on the value of `v` and the unspecified value of `y`.

Thus, the impact on state is:
- `nx` and `ny` are calculated based on the value of `v` and `y`.

After performing the calculations, `nx` and `ny` will hold integer values, but without specific inputs for `v` and `y`, we cannot determine their exact values, only their relations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `v` is the first element in the list `a`, `nx` is calculated as (v - 1) // y, `ny` is calculated as (v - 1) % y.**
