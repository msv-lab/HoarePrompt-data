Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential edge cases as outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the computed values for `x` and `y` adequately account for the path defined by the sequence in the input.

An important limitation is that the `func_1` function checks if the move from one cell to another is valid, but it uses a simple method of validating the moves based solely on the difference in row and column indices computed from `y`. This can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where there are jumps that cross the column boundary or if the path is not continuous.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 5 6 10
```
An appropriate matrix for this scenario should allow moves to adjacent cells, but here the path moves from `1` `(1, 1)` to `5` `(5, 1)`, to `6` `(6, 2)`, and then to `10` `(10, 6)`, which are not adjacent moves according to the allowed movements. The function does not return `False` for this case since it does not calculate the positions accurately based on `x` and `y` configurations, leading to potentially incorrect affirmations of path legality.

Thus, while the program may succeed for certain inputs, it is not universally valid for all cases. Hence, the correctness is determined as **False** because it can yield incorrect results for valid inputs.
