Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. It finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. 

The function `func_1` iterates over the array from right to left (i.e., from the last element to the first) and returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` it encounters, which is the last occurrence of `x` in the array because the array is sorted.

If `x` is not present in the array, the function returns `-1` after checking all elements. This is a common convention to indicate that an element is not found.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works as expected:

- In the first test, `x` is present only once, and the function returns its correct index.
- In the second test, `x` is present multiple times, and the function returns the index of its last occurrence.
- In the third test, `x` is present twice consecutively, and the function again returns the index of its last occurrence.

Since the program behaves as described for all potential cases and the problem description does not specify any error handling for invalid inputs (such as an empty list or an unsorted array), assuming valid inputs as per the problem statement, the program is correct.
