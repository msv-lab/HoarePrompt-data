The original assessment, which states that the program is correct, makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. The function `func_1` starts from the end of the array and iterates backwards. As soon as it finds a match for the target element `x`, it returns the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in the array.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the state of the program at different points, and it confirms that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. The function performs a reverse linear search on the input list, checking each element from the last to the first, and returns the index of the first matching element it encounters. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`.

The original assessment also correctly notes that the function handles the case where the target element is not found in the array by returning `-1`. The time complexity of the function is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array, because it may need to iterate through the entire array in the worst case.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program is correct, and the annotated version provides further evidence to support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
