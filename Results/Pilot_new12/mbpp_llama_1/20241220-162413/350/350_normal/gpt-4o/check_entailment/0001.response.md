Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It iterates over the array from right to left, checking if the current element matches `x`. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element, which is the last occurrence of `x` due to the reverse iteration order. If `x` is not found in the array, it returns `-1`, indicating that the element is not present.

This solution works for all the provided test cases and should handle any potential case, including:

- When `x` is present at the end of the array
- When `x` is present multiple times in the array
- When `x` is not present in the array
- When the array contains duplicate elements
- When the array is already sorted

The function does not rely on the array being sorted explicitly in its logic, but the problem statement specifies that the array is sorted, which implies that duplicate elements will be adjacent. The reverse iteration ensures that the first occurrence of `x` from the end (or the last occurrence in the array's original order) is found and returned, fulfilling the requirement of finding the last position of `x` in the sorted array.
