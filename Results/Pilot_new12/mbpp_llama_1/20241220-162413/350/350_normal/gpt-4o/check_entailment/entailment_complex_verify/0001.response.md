The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. After analyzing the problem description, the code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The function `func_1` iterates over the array from right to left, checking if the current element matches `x`. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element, which is the last occurrence of `x` due to the reverse iteration order. If `x` is not found in the array, it returns `-1`, indicating that the element is not present.

The annotated version of the code provides further evidence to support the correctness of the function. The state of the program before the function call indicates that `arr` is a sorted list of elements and `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. The state of the program after the `for` loop has been executed indicates that if `x` is in `arr`, the loop returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`; otherwise, the loop does not return a value, with `i` being `-1` after the loop finishes.

The overall description of the function in the annotated version also matches the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
