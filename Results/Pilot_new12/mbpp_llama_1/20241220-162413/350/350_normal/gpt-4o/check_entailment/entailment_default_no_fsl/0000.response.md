Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code implements a function `func_1` that finds the last position of a given element `x` in a sorted array. The function performs a reverse linear search on the input list `arr`, checking each element from the last to the first, and returns the index of the first matching element it encounters. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function returns -1, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`.

The code operates under the assumption that the input list `arr` is sorted, which allows it to efficiently find the last occurrence of the element `x` by searching from the end of the list. The code correctly handles cases where the element `x` is present multiple times in the list, returning the index of the last occurrence.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including when the element `x` is present at the beginning, middle, or end of the list, and when it is present multiple times. The code also correctly returns -1 when the element `x` is not present in the list.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, the code does not need to handle cases where the input list is empty or not a list, or where the element `x` is not a valid value for the list. Under these assumptions, the code correctly implements the specified functionality for all potential cases.
