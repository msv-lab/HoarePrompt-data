Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it iterates through the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element, which is the last position of the element in the array. The function handles the case where the target element is not found in the array by returning -1. 

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it may need to iterate through the entire array in the worst case. 

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function. 

For example, if the input array is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and the target element is `1`, the function will return `2`, which is the last position of `1` in the array. 

Similarly, if the input array is `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and the target element is `3`, the function will return `3`, which is the last position of `3` in the array. 

If the target element is not found in the array, the function will return `-1`, which is the expected behavior. 

Therefore, the program is correct and handles all potential cases according to the problem description.
