Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x` as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` if it exists, and -1 otherwise.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function iterates over the input list `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving towards the first element. This ensures that the first match encountered is the last occurrence of `x` in the list.

2. The function checks each element in the list against the target element `x`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index of the match.

3. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding a match, it returns -1, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`.

4. The program handles the case where `x` is not present in `arr` by returning -1 after iterating over the entire list.

5. The program also handles the case where `x` occurs multiple times in `arr` by returning the index of the first match encountered in the reverse iteration, which corresponds to the last occurrence of `x` in the list.

Overall, the program behaves as described in the problem description and correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various scenarios.
