You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of elements and x is an element that may or may not be present in arr.
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. If `x` is in `arr`, the loop returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`; otherwise, the loop does not return a value (implicitly returning `None`), with `i` being `-1` after the loop finishes.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x` as input, and returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` if it exists, and -1 otherwise. The function performs a reverse linear search on the input list, checking each element from the last to the first, and returns the index of the first matching element it encounters. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function returns -1, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`. The input list `arr` remains unmodified throughout the execution of the function. The return value is either a non-negative integer representing the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or -1 if `x` is not found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
