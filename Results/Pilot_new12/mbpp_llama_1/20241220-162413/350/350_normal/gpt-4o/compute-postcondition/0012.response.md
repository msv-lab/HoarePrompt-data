The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The function returns the last index of the sorted list `arr` if `x` corresponds to this position.
Case_2: The function returns the second last index of the sorted list `arr` if there is at least one element and `x` does not correspond to the last index.
Case_3: The function returns the third last index of the sorted list `arr` under certain conditions not specified.
Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns -1.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and return an index from `arr` based on the position of `x` or specific list conditions, or -1 if the conditions for the other cases are not fulfilled.
Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, returns the last index of `arr` if `x` is at the last position, the second last index if `x` is not at the last position and the list has at least one element, the third last index under certain unspecified conditions, and -1 otherwise.**
