According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to the last index of `arr`, which means `i` must be at least 0 (since `arr` has at least 1 element). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Since `i` is the last index of `arr`, decrementing it by 1 will point to the second last element of `arr`. 

Additionally, since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, and `arr` is a sorted list, the second last element of `arr` must also not be equal to `x` for the loop to continue searching for `x` in the reverse order.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, `i` is set to the second last index of `arr`, and the second last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`**
