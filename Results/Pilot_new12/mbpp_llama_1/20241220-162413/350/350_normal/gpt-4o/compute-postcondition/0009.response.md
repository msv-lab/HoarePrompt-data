Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 1 element, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and `i` is the third last index of `arr`. If `arr` at the third last index `i` is equal to `x`, the program returns the third last index of the sorted list `arr`.***
