Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 1 element, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and `i` is the second last index of `arr`. If the second last element of `arr` is equal to `x`, the program returns the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, maintaining the original state of `arr`, `x`, and `i`, with the second last element of `arr` not being equal to `x`.**
