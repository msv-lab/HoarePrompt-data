The last index of `arr` is denoted by `i`, and the value at this index in `arr` is equal to `x`. Since `arr` is a sorted list with at least one element and `x` is equal to the last element of `arr`, `i` will be the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` if `x` is present in `arr`. Given that `i` is set to the last index of `arr` and `arr` at index `i` equals `x`, the program returns the index `i` which corresponds to the last element in the sorted list `arr`, and this last element is `x`.

Output State: **The program returns the last index of the sorted list `arr`, which corresponds to the element `x`.**
