Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x` as input, and returns the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` if it exists, and -1 otherwise. The function performs a reverse linear search on the input list, checking each element from the last to the first, and returns the index of the first matching element it encounters. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function returns -1, indicating that `x` is not present in `arr`. The input list `arr` remains unmodified throughout the execution of the function. The return value is either a non-negative integer representing the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or -1 if `x` is not found.**
