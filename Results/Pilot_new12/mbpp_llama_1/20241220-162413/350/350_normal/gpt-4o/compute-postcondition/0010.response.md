To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided information and loop code step by step.

1. **Initial State**: `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`.

2. **Loop Code**:
    ```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] == x:
        return i
```
    This loop iterates over `arr` in reverse order. If it finds an element equal to `x`, it immediately returns the index of that element.

3. **Output State after Loop Executes**:
    - If the loop executes at least once, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` will be set to the last index of `arr` after the first iteration.
    - The loop will continue until it either finds `x` in `arr` and returns its index or until it has checked all elements in `arr` without finding `x`.

4. **Determining Final Output State**:
    - If `x` is found in `arr`, the loop will return the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` because it iterates in reverse order. 
    - If `x` is not found in `arr`, the loop will complete all iterations without returning any value (implicitly returning `None` in Python), and `i` will be set to `-1` after the loop finishes, since the loop iterates until `i` reaches `-1`.
    - The original value of `arr` remains unchanged throughout the loop as the loop does not modify `arr`.
    - The original value of `x` also remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

- If `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`. 
- If `x` is not found in `arr`, the loop completes without returning an index (or implicitly returns `None`), and `i` ends at `-1`.

However, since the task is to describe the state of variables after the loop has executed, considering that the loop's purpose is to find the index of `x` in `arr` and that the loop iterates in reverse, we focus on what is guaranteed to happen:

- `arr` remains a sorted list of elements.
- `x` remains an element that may or may not be present in `arr`.
- If `x` is in `arr`, the function will have returned its index (specifically, the index of its last occurrence due to the reverse iteration).
- If `x` is not in `arr`, and assuming the function does not return `None` explicitly but rather the absence of a return value implies `None`, then `i` would technically be `-1` after the loop, though this detail about `i` is less critical given the function's return behavior.

Considering these points and the requirement to format the answer as instructed:

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. If `x` is in `arr`, the loop returns the index of the last occurrence of `x`; otherwise, the loop does not return a value (implicitly returning `None`), with `i` being `-1` after the loop finishes.**
