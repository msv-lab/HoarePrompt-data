Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and `i` is the last index - 1 of `arr`. If the last element of `arr` is equal to `target`, the program returns the second-to-last index of `arr`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**
