To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given that `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements and `i` is the last index - 1 of `arr`, we understand that `i` represents the second-to-last index of the list `arr`. 

The code snippet simply returns `i`, which means it returns the second-to-last index of the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the second-to-last index of the sorted list `arr`.**
