To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means `i` starts from the last index of `arr` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 1 element.
- `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`.
- `i` is set to the last index of `arr`.
- The last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.

Given that the loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `arr` still needs to be a sorted list with at least 1 element, as this condition doesn't change with iterations.
- `target` remains the same, as its value or presence in `arr` doesn't dictate the iteration condition directly.
- `i` must decrement by 1 from its current value (which is the last index of `arr`) to point to the second last element of `arr`. This implies `i` should be the second last index of `arr`.
- For the loop to continue, it's implicit that there must be at least one more element before the current `i` (which was the last index), meaning `arr` must have at least 2 elements for `i` to be decremented and still be a valid index.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time would be:
- `arr` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr` (this doesn't change).
- `i` is the second last index of `arr`.
- Since we're moving to the previous element, the condition regarding the comparison of the element at index `i` and `target` isn't explicitly stated but implies that the second last element of `arr` is also not equal to `target`, or at least, this condition doesn't prevent the loop from executing again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, `i` is the second last index of `arr`**
