According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a sorted list of elements and `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `arr` must have at least 1 element and `i` is now set to the last index of `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, `i` is set to the last index of `arr`**
