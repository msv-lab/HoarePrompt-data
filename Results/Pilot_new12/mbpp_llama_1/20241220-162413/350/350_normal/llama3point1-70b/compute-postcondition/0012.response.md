The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following cases: 
1. The function returns the last index of the sorted list `arr`, which corresponds to the index of the `target` element.
2. The function returns the second last index of the sorted list `arr`.
3. The function returns the second-to-last index of the sorted list `arr`.
4. The function returns -1, indicating that the target element was not found in the sorted list `arr`.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and return an index based on the target element's presence and position in the list, or -1 if the target element is not found.
Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list arr and a target element, returns an index based on the target element's presence and position in the list, or -1 if the target element is not found.**
