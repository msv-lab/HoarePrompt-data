To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information.

1. **Loop Iteration and Termination**: The loop iterates from the last index of `arr` down to the first index (0). If at any point `arr[i]` is equal to `target`, the function returns the index `i`. This means the loop will terminate as soon as it finds a match.

2. **No Match Found**: If the loop iterates through all elements of `arr` without finding a match (i.e., `arr[i] == target` is never true), it will complete all iterations without returning any index. In this case, the function does not explicitly return any value or modify the variables `arr` and `target` directly within the loop.

3. **Variables' States After Loop Execution**:
   - `arr`: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - `target`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i`: After the loop finishes (without finding a match), `i` will be `-1` because the loop iterates until `i` reaches `-1` (due to the range `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`).

Given these considerations:

- If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all because `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)` will be empty.
- If `target` is found in `arr`, the loop will return the index of `target` and terminate. The state of variables after this point is not the focus since the function ends.
- If `target` is not found in `arr`, the loop completes all iterations, and the function ends without explicitly returning an index.

Considering all scenarios and focusing on the state after all iterations or the conditions for the loop's execution, we can deduce the output state.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and if `target` is found in `arr`, the function returns its index; otherwise, no index is returned, and `i` is `-1` if the loop completes without finding `target`.**
