The program returns the value of `i`, which is the index of the `target` in the sorted list `arr`. Since `i` is initially set to the last index of `arr` and the last element of `arr` is equal to the `target`, the program returns the last index of `arr`. 

Output State: **The program returns the last index of the sorted list `arr`, which corresponds to the index of the `target` element**
