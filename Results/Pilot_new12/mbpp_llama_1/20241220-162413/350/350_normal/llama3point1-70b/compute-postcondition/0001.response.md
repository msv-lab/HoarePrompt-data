Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, `i` is initially set to the last index of `arr`. The current value of `arr` at index `i` is equal to the `target`, meaning the last element of the sorted list `arr` is the `target`.**
