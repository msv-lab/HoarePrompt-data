Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and `i` is the second last index of `arr`. If the element at the second last index `i` of `arr` is equal to `target`, the program returns the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, there is no specified change or return.***
