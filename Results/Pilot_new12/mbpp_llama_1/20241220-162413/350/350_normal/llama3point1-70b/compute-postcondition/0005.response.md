To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given information and the code snippet provided. 

Given that `arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements and `i` is the second last index of `arr`, we understand that `i` is an index value. 

Since the list has at least 2 elements, the minimum length of `arr` is 2. For a list of length 2, the second last index `i` would be 0 (since indexing starts at 0). For any list longer than 2 elements, `i` would be the index of the second to last element.

The code simply returns `i`, which is the second last index of the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, considering all the given information, when the code returns `i`, it returns the index of the second last element in the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the second last index of the sorted list 'arr'**
