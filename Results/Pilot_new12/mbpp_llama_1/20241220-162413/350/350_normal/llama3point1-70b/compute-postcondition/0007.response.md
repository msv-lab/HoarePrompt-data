According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `arr`. The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second last index of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes the last index - 1 (which is the third last index if `arr` had at least 3 elements initially, but since it was the second last index, this adjustment makes it the last index - 1, implying the last index was the one before the second last). 
State: **`arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and `i` is the last index - 1 of `arr`**
