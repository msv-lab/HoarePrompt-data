You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It finds the last position of a target element in a sorted array by iterating through the array in reverse order and returning the index of the first occurrence of the target element. If the target element is not found, it returns -1.

The function correctly handles the following cases:

- The target element is present in the array: It returns the last index of the target element.
- The target element is not present in the array: It returns -1.
- The array is empty: It returns -1, which is the expected behavior.
- The target element appears multiple times in the array: It returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element.

The function's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because in the worst-case scenario, it needs to iterate through the entire array. The function's space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the index and the target element.

Overall, the function is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element in the list if it exists, or -1 if the `target` element is not found. The function performs a reverse search on the sorted list, checking each element from the end of the list to the beginning. If the `target` element is found, its index is returned immediately. If the loop completes without finding the `target` element, the function returns -1, indicating that the `target` element is not present in the sorted list. The function handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. The function does not modify the original list or the `target` element, and only returns an index or -1 based on the presence and position of the `target` element in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
