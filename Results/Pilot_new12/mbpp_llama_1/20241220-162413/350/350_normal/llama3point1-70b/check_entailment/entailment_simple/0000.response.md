To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to assess whether it accurately fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

The provided function `func_1(arr, target)` iterates through the sorted list `arr` from the end to the beginning. If it encounters the `target` element during this iteration, it immediately returns the index `i` where the `target` was found. If the loop completes without finding the `target`, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the `target` element is not present in the `arr`.

Here's why this program is correct:

1. **Searching from the End**: By iterating from the end of the array towards the beginning, the function is guaranteed to find the last occurrence of the `target` element if it exists. This is because the array is sorted, and the first occurrence from the end will be the last in the sequence of repeated elements.

2. **Handling Non-existence**: If the `target` element is not found after iterating through the entire array, the function correctly returns `-1`. This indicates that the element is not present in the array, fulfilling the requirement to handle cases where the target might not exist.

3. **Correct Index Return**: The function returns the correct index of the `target` element if found. Since Python uses zero-based indexing, the returned index accurately represents the position of the `target` element within the array.

4. **Efficiency**: The function achieves this with a linear time complexity (O(n)), where n is the number of elements in the array, since in the worst case it might have to traverse the entire array. However, its efficiency in terms of finding the last occurrence without needing to traverse the entire array unless necessary makes it suitable for the task.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It accurately finds the last position of an element in a sorted array and handles the case where the element is not found.

Correctness: **True**
