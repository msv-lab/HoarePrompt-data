Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it properly implements a function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function `func_1` iterates through the array in reverse order, returning the index of the first occurrence of the target element it encounters. If the target element is not found, the function returns -1. 

The output hints provided match the code's functionality, and the code handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with one element, and a target element that is not present in the list.

The function assumes that the input is a valid sorted list and a target element, and it does not contain any error checking code to handle invalid inputs. However, according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The code works correctly for every potential case, including:

- When the target element is present in the list, the function returns its last index.
- When the target element is not present in the list, the function returns -1.
- When the list contains only one element, the function returns the index of that element if it matches the target, or -1 otherwise.
- When the list is empty, the function returns -1.

Since the code handles all these cases correctly and the output hints agree with the code's functionality, the correctness of the code is **True**.
