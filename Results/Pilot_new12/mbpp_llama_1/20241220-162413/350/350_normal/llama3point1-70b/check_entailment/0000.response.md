Correctness: **True**.

The program provided correctly implements a function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. It iterates through the array in reverse order (`range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`), which ensures that the first occurrence of the target element it finds will be the last one in the array.

2. It checks each element in the array to see if it matches the target (`if arr[i] == target`), and if it does, it immediately returns the index of that element (`return i`).

3. If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1 (`return -1`), which is a common convention for indicating that an element was not found.

This implementation is correct because it correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The fact that the array is sorted is not actually relevant to the correctness of this function, because it simply returns the last occurrence of the target element it finds, regardless of the ordering of the array.

For example, if you call `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], 2)`, the function will correctly return `5`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `2` in the array. If you call `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)`, the function will correctly return `-1`, because `6` is not in the array.
