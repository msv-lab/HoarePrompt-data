Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The provided annotated program does exactly this.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

* The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`.
* It iterates over the sorted list from the end to the beginning using a for loop.
* If it finds the `target` element, it returns its index immediately. Since it's iterating from the end, this ensures that it returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element.
* If the loop completes without finding the `target` element, it returns -1, indicating that the `target` element is not present in the sorted list.

The program handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to worry about cases like an empty list or a list that's not sorted.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it correct.
