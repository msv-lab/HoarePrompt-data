Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It finds the last position of a target element in a sorted array by iterating through the array in reverse order and returning the index of the first occurrence of the target element. If the target element is not found, it returns -1.

The function correctly handles the following cases:

- The target element is present in the array: It returns the last index of the target element.
- The target element is not present in the array: It returns -1.
- The array is empty: It returns -1, which is the expected behavior.
- The target element appears multiple times in the array: It returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element.

The function's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because in the worst-case scenario, it needs to iterate through the entire array. The function's space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the index and the target element.

Overall, the function is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
