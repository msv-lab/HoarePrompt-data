Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and efficient solution to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It performs a reverse search on the sorted list, checking each element from the end of the list to the beginning, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element if it exists. If the target element is not found, the function returns -1. The code handles edge cases where the target element is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. 

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of how the function works. The function does not modify the original list or the target element, and only returns an index or -1 based on the presence and position of the target element in the list.

The code works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When the target element is present in the list, it returns the index of the last occurrence.
- When the target element is not present in the list, it returns -1.
- When the list is empty, it returns -1.
- When the list contains only one element, it returns the index of that element if it is the target, or -1 if it is not.

Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or is an empty list. Therefore, the code is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
