The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element in the list if it exists, or -1 if the `target` element is not found. The function performs a reverse search on the sorted list, checking each element from the end of the list to the beginning. If the `target` element is found, its index is returned immediately. If the loop completes without finding the `target` element, the function returns -1, indicating that the `target` element is not present in the sorted list. The function handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. The function does not modify the original list or the `target` element, and only returns an index or -1 based on the presence and position of the `target` element in the list.
