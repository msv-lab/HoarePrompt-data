#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of elements, and target is an element that may or may not be present in arr.
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements, `target` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`, and if `target` is found in `arr`, the function returns its index; otherwise, no index is returned, and `i` is `-1` if the loop completes without finding `target`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target element was not found in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `arr` and a target element `target`, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element in the list if it exists, or -1 if the `target` element is not found. The function performs a reverse search on the sorted list, checking each element from the end of the list to the beginning. If the `target` element is found, its index is returned immediately. If the loop completes without finding the `target` element, the function returns -1, indicating that the `target` element is not present in the sorted list. The function handles edge cases where the `target` element is not present in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. The function does not modify the original list or the `target` element, and only returns an index or -1 based on the presence and position of the `target` element in the list.
