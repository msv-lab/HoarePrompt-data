The function searches for a specific number `num` within a sorted list of numbers `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function operates on the assumption that the input list `arr` is sorted, and it does not modify the original list. It handles edge cases where `num` is at any position in `arr`, including the first and last positions, as well as cases where `num` is not present in `arr`, in which case it returns -1. The function effectively performs a linear search operation on the sorted list, providing a simple and straightforward way to locate a specific number within a sorted sequence.
