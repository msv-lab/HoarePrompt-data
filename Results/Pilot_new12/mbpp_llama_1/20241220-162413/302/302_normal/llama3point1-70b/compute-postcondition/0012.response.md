The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. `arr` is a sorted list of numbers, and `num` is a number. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer value based on certain conditions. The possible return values are 0, 1, 2, or -1. 

Since the specific conditions for each return value are not specified, we can only describe the functionality in general terms.
