To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided output states for the first few iterations and the loop code itself.

The loop code iterates over the sorted list `arr` and checks if each element `x` is equal to the number `num`. If a match is found, the loop returns the index `i` of that element. If no match is found after iterating over the entire list, the loop completes without returning any value.

Given the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Completion of the Loop**: The loop will only complete if `num` is not found in `arr`, or if it's found at the last index of `arr`.
2. **Return Condition**: If `num` is found in `arr`, the loop returns the index `i` of `num`. This means that if the loop completes without returning, `num` is not in `arr`.
3. **Variables' State**: 
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it's only being iterated over, not modified.
   - `num` remains the same, as it's a reference value used for comparison and doesn't change throughout the loop.
   - `i` and `x` are dependent on the iteration. If the loop completes (no return), `i` will be the last index of `arr`, and `x` will be the last element of `arr`.

Considering these points, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished (or not finished due to a return) can be deduced as follows:

- If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num` before completing the loop, meaning `i` will be the index of `num` in `arr`, and `x` will be equal to `num`.
- If `num` is not found in `arr`, the loop completes without returning, and `i` will be the last index of `arr`, and `x` will be the last element of `arr`.

However, since the task asks for the state after all iterations, and considering the loop might return early, we need to focus on the scenario where the loop completes naturally (without finding `num` in `arr`) and the scenario where it returns early (finding `num` in `arr`).

Given the loop's design, if `num` is in `arr`, the loop doesn't actually "finish" in the conventional sense because it returns before completing all iterations. Thus, the "output state" after all iterations in the context of loop completion refers to the scenario where `num` is not in `arr`, or the loop's natural completion state.

**Output State:** **`arr` is a sorted list of numbers, `num` is a number, if `num` is in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`; otherwise, `i` is the last index of `arr`, and `x` is the last element of `arr`.**
