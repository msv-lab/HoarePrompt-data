To solve this, let's analyze the information given:

1. `arr` is a sorted list of numbers with at least one element.
2. `num` is a number.
3. `i` is initially 0.
4. `x` is the first element in `arr`.
5. The current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `num`.

Given the return statement `return i`, we're looking at what `i` represents in the context of the program. Since `i` is initially 0 and there's no information provided that `i` is modified anywhere in the given snippet, `i` remains 0 when the program reaches the return statement.

The fact that `arr` is sorted, `x` equals `num`, and `x` is the first element of `arr` provides context about the setup but does not affect the value of `i` at the point of return.

Output State: **The program returns 0**
