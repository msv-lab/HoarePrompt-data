According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr` and the index `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is a number, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Also, for the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element in `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is a number, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr`**
