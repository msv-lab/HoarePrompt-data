Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

* The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a sorted array `arr` and a number `num`.
* It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element.
* If it finds a value `x` that is equal to the target number `num`, it immediately returns the index `i` of that value. This ensures that the function returns the index of the **first** occurrence of the number in the sorted array.
* If the function iterates through the entire array without finding the target number, it returns -1, indicating that the number is not present in the array.

The program correctly handles the case where the target number is not present in the array and returns -1 in that case. It also correctly handles the case where the target number is present multiple times in the array, as it returns the index of the first occurrence.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., `arr` is a sorted list of numbers, and `num` is a number), the program will always produce the correct result. Therefore, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, and its correctness can be confirmed.
