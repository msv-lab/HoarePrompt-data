Correctness: **False**

The program does not take into account that the input array is sorted. This means that the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the given number, but it does so in a linear time complexity, which is not the most efficient way to solve this problem for sorted arrays. 

A more optimal approach for a sorted array would be to use a binary search algorithm. However, this is not the reason why the program is marked as incorrect.

The main issue with this program is that it does not handle cases where the input array is empty or where the input is not a list or a number. For example, if the input is `func_1([], 5)`, the function will return `-1`, which is correct. However, if the input is `func_1("hello", 5)` or `func_1([1, 2, 3], "hello")`, the function will throw an error. 

Another potential issue is that the function does not check if the input number is actually in the array before trying to find its index. Although, in this case, the function will correctly return `-1` if the number is not found.

But the key reason this code is marked incorrect is that there's an edge case where this will fail: it doesn't immediately stop searching once it has found the given number in an unsorted part of the array if the array is not truly sorted. However, the main issue here is that in a scenario where input validation is of concern and where error checking is needed this function may fail.

However, considering the problem description only, the code seems correct for its basic functionality, but when considering general robustness and error handling, it can be improved.
