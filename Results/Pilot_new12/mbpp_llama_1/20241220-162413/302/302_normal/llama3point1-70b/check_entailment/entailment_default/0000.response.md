Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple linear search function that iterates through the sorted array `arr` and returns the index of the first occurrence of the number `num`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `num` is at any position in `arr`, including the first and last positions, as well as cases where `num` is not present in `arr`, in which case it returns -1.

The code operates under the assumption that the input list `arr` is sorted, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. It does not take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted to improve the search efficiency, but it still correctly finds the first occurrence of `num`.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function performs a linear search operation on the sorted list and returns the index of `num` if found, or -1 if not found.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or an empty list, or where the input number is not a positive integer. Under these assumptions, the code correctly implements the desired functionality and works for every potential case.
