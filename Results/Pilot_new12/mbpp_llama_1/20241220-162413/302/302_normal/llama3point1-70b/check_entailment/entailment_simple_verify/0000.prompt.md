You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element.
2. As soon as it finds an element `x` that matches the given number `num`, it returns the index `i`.
3. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not in the array.

This implementation meets the problem description because it:

* Returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number.
* Handles the case where the number is not in the array by returning `-1`.
* Does not require the array to be sorted, but the problem description specifies that it is. However, the function will still work correctly even if the array is not sorted, as it simply returns the first occurrence of the number.

In the context of a sorted array, this function will still return the first occurrence of the number. Since the array is sorted, all occurrences of the same number will be adjacent. Therefore, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the number, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

Overall, the code is correct and works as expected for both sorted and unsorted arrays. However, it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted, which could potentially allow for a more efficient implementation using a binary search. Nevertheless, the provided function meets the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of numbers, and num is a number.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return -1
    #The program returns -1


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
