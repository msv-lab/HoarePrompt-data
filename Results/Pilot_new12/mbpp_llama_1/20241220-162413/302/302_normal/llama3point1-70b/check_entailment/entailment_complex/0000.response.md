Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. It finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a sorted list of numbers) and `num` (the number to be searched). This aligns with the problem description.

2. The function iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which allows it to access both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element in the list. This is an efficient way to search for a specific number in a list.

3. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element `x` is equal to the target number `num`. If it is, the function returns the index `i` of that element. This meets the problem description's requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number.

4. If the loop completes without finding the target number, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the number was not found in the list. This also aligns with the problem description.

5. The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted, as stated in the problem description and the function's annotations. This is a valid assumption, given that the problem description guarantees the input will be valid.

6. The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target number is at the first or last position in the list, or when it's not present in the list at all.

The only potential issue could be that the function performs a linear search, which may not be the most efficient approach for very large sorted lists (a binary search would be more efficient in such cases). However, the problem description does not specify any requirements for the search algorithm's efficiency, so this does not affect the program's correctness.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
