You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not take into account that the input array is sorted. This means that the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the given number, but it does so in a linear time complexity, which is not the most efficient way to solve this problem for sorted arrays. 

A more optimal approach for a sorted array would be to use a binary search algorithm. However, this is not the reason why the program is marked as incorrect.

The main issue with this program is that it does not handle cases where the input array is empty or where the input is not a list or a number. For example, if the input is `func_1([], 5)`, the function will return `-1`, which is correct. However, if the input is `func_1("hello", 5)` or `func_1([1, 2, 3], "hello")`, the function will throw an error. 

Another potential issue is that the function does not check if the input number is actually in the array before trying to find its index. Although, in this case, the function will correctly return `-1` if the number is not found.

But the key reason this code is marked incorrect is that there's an edge case where this will fail: it doesn't immediately stop searching once it has found the given number in an unsorted part of the array if the array is not truly sorted. However, the main issue here is that in a scenario where input validation is of concern and where error checking is needed this function may fail.

However, considering the problem description only, the code seems correct for its basic functionality, but when considering general robustness and error handling, it can be improved.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function searches for a specific number `num` within a sorted list of numbers `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function operates on the assumption that the input list `arr` is sorted, and it does not modify the original list. It handles edge cases where `num` is at any position in `arr`, including the first and last positions, as well as cases where `num` is not present in `arr`, in which case it returns -1. The function effectively performs a linear search operation on the sorted list, providing a simple and straightforward way to locate a specific number within a sorted sequence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
