Correctness: **True**

The given Python program implements a linear search function `func_1` to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. As soon as it finds a match (`x == num`), it returns the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns -1, indicating that `num` is not present in `arr`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:

1. **Finding the first occurrence**: Since the function returns as soon as it finds the first match, it correctly identifies the first occurrence of `num` in the sorted array.
2. **Handling edge cases**: The function correctly handles cases where `num` is at the first or last position in `arr`, as well as when `num` is not present in `arr` (returning -1).
3. **Sorted array assumption**: The function assumes that the input list `arr` is sorted and does not modify the original list.
4. **Linear search operation**: The function performs a linear search, which is a straightforward way to locate a specific number within a sorted sequence.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality, and there are no evident cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
