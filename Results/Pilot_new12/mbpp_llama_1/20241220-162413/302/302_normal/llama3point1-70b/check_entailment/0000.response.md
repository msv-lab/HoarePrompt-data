Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element.
2. As soon as it finds an element `x` that matches the given number `num`, it returns the index `i`.
3. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not in the array.

This implementation meets the problem description because it:

* Returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number.
* Handles the case where the number is not in the array by returning `-1`.
* Does not require the array to be sorted, but the problem description specifies that it is. However, the function will still work correctly even if the array is not sorted, as it simply returns the first occurrence of the number.

In the context of a sorted array, this function will still return the first occurrence of the number. Since the array is sorted, all occurrences of the same number will be adjacent. Therefore, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the number, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

Overall, the code is correct and works as expected for both sorted and unsorted arrays. However, it does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted, which could potentially allow for a more efficient implementation using a binary search. Nevertheless, the provided function meets the requirements of the problem description.
