The original assessment states that the provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. After reviewing the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I agree with the original assessment.

The function `func_1` uses a simple linear search approach to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr`. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. As soon as it finds an element `x` that matches the given number `num`, it returns the index `i`. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not in the array.

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior and provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. The annotations indicate that the program returns `-1` if the number is not found in the array, which is consistent with the problem description.

One potential concern is that the function does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted, which could allow for a more efficient implementation using a binary search. However, the problem description does not require the function to use a specific search algorithm, and the provided function still meets the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
