To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the condition for the `while` loop and the implications of the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is `low <= high`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must hold true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- The updates to `result`, `low`, and `high` depend on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `target`.

The critical aspect here is the comparison and update of `low` and `high`. For the loop to proceed, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. 

Given that `mid` equals `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, if `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. This means `low` must still be less than or equal to `mid - 1` for the loop to potentially execute again. However, if `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, then the search space is adjusted based on whether `arr[mid]` is less than or greater than `target`.

The adjustment of `low` and `high` is as follows:
- If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `high`, which initially is `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `low` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1`.

Since `arr` is a sorted list and the search space adjustments are based on comparisons between `arr[mid]` and `target`, the only requirement for the loop to potentially execute again is that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after the adjustments.

Considering the adjustments and the requirement for the loop to execute again, no specific adjustments to `arr`, `target`, or `result` are needed beyond ensuring that the relationship between `low` and `high` allows for another iteration. The key states that need to be preserved or adjusted are the indices `low` and `high`, ensuring that `low` is less than or equal to `high` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.**
