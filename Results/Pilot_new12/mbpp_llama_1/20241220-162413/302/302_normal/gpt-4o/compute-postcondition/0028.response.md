Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`: if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, in both cases `mid` becomes the new average of `low` and `high`.***
