To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement `while low <= high:`.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
2. **Given States**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then:
     - `low` is less than or equal to the previous value of `high`.
     - `high` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, where `high` is the previous value.
     - `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, where `high` is the previous value.
     - `result` is `(low + high) // 2`, where `high` is the previous value.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

Given these updates, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must still be true after the updates.

- **When `arr[mid]` equals `target`**: 
  - `high` becomes `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to this new `high`. However, since `low` is less than or equal to the previous `high`, and the new `high` is less than the previous `high`, we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1` for the loop to potentially continue. This implies that the difference between `low` and `high` must be at least 2 to allow `low` to be less than or equal to the new `high` after the update.

- **When `arr[mid]` is less than `target`**:
  - `low` becomes `mid + 1`. For the loop to continue, `mid + 1` (the new `low`) must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, we must ensure that `(low + high) // 2 + 1` is less than or equal to `high`, which generally holds true because `mid` is rounded down, implying there's at least one element to the right of `mid` unless `mid` is the last element.

- **When `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`**:
  - `high` becomes `mid - 1`. For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, suggesting that `low` cannot be equal to `high` at the start of this iteration for the loop to continue after this update.

Considering these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `low` and `high` are positioned such that `low` is less than or equal to `high` after any update based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`. The other states like `arr` being sorted, `target` being an integer, and the specific updates to `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `result` based on the comparison, do not directly impact whether the loop can execute one more time but rather how the loop progresses.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, and after any update, `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to continue.**
