To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers
- `target` is an integer
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`

The given code is: 
```python
low = mid + 1
```

This code updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this into the update for `low`:

`low` becomes `(low + high) // 2 + 1`

All other variables (`arr`, `target`, `high`, and `mid`) retain their initial values and properties. The relationship between `low` and `high` is updated because `low` is now set to `mid + 1`, which directly depends on the previous values of `low` and `high`. However, we cannot assert a new specific relationship between `low` and `high` without knowing their exact initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` retains its value, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.** 

But since `low` has been updated, for `mid` the equation `(low + high) // 2` will yield a different value now because `low` has changed. This means we should consider `mid` as potentially needing an update if it's used after `low` has been updated. However, based on the given code, `mid` itself isn't updated here, so its definition remains tied to the original formula, even though its value would change if recalculated with the new `low`. 

So, considering the instructions precisely and focusing on what's directly changed by the code:
**`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` retains its value, `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `low`.** 

Given the direct update and previous definitions:
**`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` was `(low + high) // 2` before `low` update.** 

Considering the exact instruction to follow the format but focusing on clarity and precision in complex situations like this, and understanding that my explanation aims to dissect the update process step by step but may lead to a slightly complexOutput State description due to the interdependency of `low` and `mid`, the core idea is to reflect the change in `low` directly and acknowledge the potential for `mid` to be different if recalculated.
