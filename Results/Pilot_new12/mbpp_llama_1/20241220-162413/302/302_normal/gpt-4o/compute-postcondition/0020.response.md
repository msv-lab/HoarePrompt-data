Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, with `mid` being `(low + high) // 2` before any update, and all variables retain their initial properties except for the updates made to `low` or `high`.**
