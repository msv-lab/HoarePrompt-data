The code calculates the middle index `mid` of the current range `[low, high]`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Given the initial state, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. 

`mid` is assigned the value `(0 + (len(arr) - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
