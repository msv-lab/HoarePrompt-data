Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `low` is less than or equal to the previous value of `high`, `high` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` (where `high` is the previous value), and `result` is `(low + high) // 2` (where `high` is the previous value). Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, with `mid` being `(low + high) // 2` before any update, and all variables retain their initial properties except for the updates made to `low` or `high`.***
