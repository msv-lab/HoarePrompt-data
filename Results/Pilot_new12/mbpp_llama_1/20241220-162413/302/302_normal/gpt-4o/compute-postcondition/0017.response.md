The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this expression into the update for `high`. Therefore, `high` becomes `((low + high) // 2) - 1`. However, since `high` is being updated, we need to use its previous value. Let's keep `high` as is in the expression for `mid` for now, as `mid` is not updated in the given code. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. So, `arr` is still a sorted list of integers, `target` is still an integer, `low` is still less than or equal to the previous value of `high`, `mid` is still equal to `(low + high) // 2` (but now this expression is using the old value of `high`), and `result` is still equal to `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2` (again, using the old value of `high`).

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to the previous value of `high`, `high` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` (where `high` is the previous value), `result` is `(low + high) // 2` (where `high` is the previous value)**
