The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, the new value of `high` is `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`. The state of `arr` being a sorted list of integers, `target` being an integer, `low` being 0, `result` being -1, and the value of `arr` at index `mid` not being equal to `target` but greater than or equal to `target` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the value of `arr` at index `mid` is not equal to `target` but is greater than or equal to `target`.**
