Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target` as parameters, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if it exists, otherwise returns -1. This index corresponds to the position where `target` should be located in the sorted list to maintain sorted order, specifically it is the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the original `arr` if found. If the input list `arr` is empty, the function will return -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the `target` value, preserving their original state. After the function concludes, the state of the program will be: the original list `arr` remains unchanged, the `target` value remains unchanged, and the returned index indicates the position of `target` in `arr` if it exists or -1 if it does not.**
