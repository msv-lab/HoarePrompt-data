The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, which is the index of the middle element in the list, `high` becomes the index of the middle element minus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `mid - 1` which equals `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`, `result` is `mid` which equals `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
