The code assigns the value -1 to the variable `result`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`arr` is still a sorted list of integers, `target` is still an integer, `low` is still 0, and `high` is still `len(arr) - 1`.
The variable `result` now holds the value -1.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1**
