Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, initially `low` is 0, initially `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, initially `result` is -1, initially `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the value of `arr` at index `mid` is not equal to `target`. The current value of `mid` is such that `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, indicating the target value is potentially in the second half of the array.**
