Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the value of `arr` at index `mid` is not equal to `target`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, then `low` is 0 and `high` is `((len(arr) - 1) // 2) - 1`.***
