Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr` at index `mid` (which equals `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`) is equal to `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `result` remains -1, and the search space is updated: if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`; if `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `low` remains 0 and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
