To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

The given code is:
```python
low = mid + 1
```

This code updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this into the update statement to understand the relationship between the new `low` and the original `low` and `high`.

However, we don't need to directly calculate this since the relationship is explicitly given by the update statement itself. The key point is that `low` is now set to `mid + 1`, which means it increases by at least 1 from its previous value, given that `mid` is an integer and is the midpoint of `low` and `high`.

Thus, after executing the code:
- `arr` remains a sorted list of integers, as the code does not modify `arr`.
- `target` remains an integer, as the code does not modify `target`.
- The relationship between `low` and `high` changes because `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` was `(low + high) // 2`, the new `low` is now greater than the old `mid`, implying that the search space, if this is part of a search algorithm, has been reduced.
- `mid`'s value, as defined by `(low + high) // 2`, would change if `low` or `high` changes, but the code does not explicitly update `mid` or `high`. The value of `mid` before the update is still known but is no longer the midpoint of the new `low` and the unchanged `high`. 

Given this analysis, the output state is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is `mid + 1`, where `mid` was the midpoint of the original `low` and `high`.
- The new value of `low` is greater than the original `low` by at least 1, considering `mid`'s definition.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `mid + 1` where `mid` was `(low + high) // 2` before the update, and `high` remains unchanged.**
