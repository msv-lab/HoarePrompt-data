The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `low` and the value of the length of the list `arr` minus 1 to the variable `high`. The initial state mentions that `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `target` is an integer. The state of `arr` and `target` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`**
