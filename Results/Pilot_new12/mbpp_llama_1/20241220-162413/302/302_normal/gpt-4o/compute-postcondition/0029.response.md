Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals the old `mid` and `high` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `target`: if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, in both cases `mid` becomes the new average of the updated `low` and `high`.***
