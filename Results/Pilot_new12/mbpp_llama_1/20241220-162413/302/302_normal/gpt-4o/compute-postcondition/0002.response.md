According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. Since `low` is already less than or equal to `high` (because the list has at least one element for `high` to be defined as `len(arr) - 1`), no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes at least one time. The existing conditions already satisfy the loop's prerequisite.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1**
