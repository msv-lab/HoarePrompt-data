To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet calculates the `mid` index using the formula `mid = (low + high) // 2`. This operation does not modify the `arr`, `target`, `low`, or `high` variables but introduces a new variable `mid` whose value is the integer part of the average of `low` and `high`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

After executing the code, the new variable `mid` is introduced with the value `(low + high) // 2`, which is the index midway between `low` and `high`. The state of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
