To determine the output state, we first examine the given initial state and the code snippet. The initial state is as follows:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `result` is equal to `mid`, which means `result` is also `(low + high) // 2`.

The code snippet given is:
```python
high = mid - 1
```
This line of code updates the value of `high` to be `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, substituting `mid` in the update equation gives us:
```python
high = ((low + high) // 2) - 1
```
However, we must calculate the new value of `high` based on its previous value and the value of `mid` before it is updated. Given that `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, the update essentially sets `high` to the value before the midpoint between the old `low` and `high`. 

Considering the previous values and the relationships between `low`, `high`, and `mid`, after executing the code, the new `high` becomes less than the old `mid` because it's set to `mid - 1`.

Given that the states of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `result` are not directly affected by the update of `high`, these variables retain their initial state descriptions. However, the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid` changes because `high` is now less than the original `mid`, which means the new `mid` would also change if recalculated based on the new `high`. But the code snippet only updates `high` without recalculating `mid` or `result`. Therefore, `mid` and `result` retain their values based on the previous `low` and `high`, but the relationship that `result` equals `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2` no longer holds with the new `high` since `mid` and `result` are not updated.

So, after running the code:
- `arr` is still a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is still an integer.
- `low` is less than or equal to the new `high`.
- `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2` before the update of `high`, but this relationship no longer holds with the new `high`.
- `result` is still equal to the old `mid`, which was `(low + high) // 2` before `high` was updated.
- The new `high` is `mid - 1`, where `mid` is the old value of `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the old `(low + high) // 2`, `result` equals the old `mid`, and `high` is `mid - 1`.**
