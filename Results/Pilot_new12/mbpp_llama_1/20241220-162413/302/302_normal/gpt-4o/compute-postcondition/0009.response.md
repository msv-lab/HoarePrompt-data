The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, which means `low` becomes `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1`. Since `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, the new value of `low` is used to potentially find `target` in the second half of the array. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the value of `arr` at index `mid` is not equal to `target` and is less than `target`.**
