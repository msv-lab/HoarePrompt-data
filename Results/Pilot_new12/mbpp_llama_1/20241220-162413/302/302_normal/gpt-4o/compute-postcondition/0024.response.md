The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to a new variable `result`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, `result` will have the same value as `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is equal to `mid` which is `(low + high) // 2`.**
