The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, but since `high` has been updated, we need to consider the previous value of `high`. Let's denote the previous value of `high` as `high_prev`. Then, `mid` is `(low + high_prev) // 2`. Now, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, which is `((low + high_prev) // 2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high_prev) // 2`, and `high` is `((low + high_prev) // 2) - 1`**
