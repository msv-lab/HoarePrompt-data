Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints agree with the code and describe the functionality correctly.

The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. When the target number is found, the function updates the `result` variable with the current index and moves the `high` pointer to the left to continue searching for the first occurrence of the target number on the left side of the current index.

The function handles the case where the input list `arr` is empty, as the `while` loop will not be executed and the function will return -1. The function also handles the case where the target number is not found in the list, as the `while` loop will terminate and the function will return -1.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly. For example, `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)` returns 1, which is the index of the first occurrence of 5 in the list.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description, and there are no obvious cases where the program does not work as expected.
