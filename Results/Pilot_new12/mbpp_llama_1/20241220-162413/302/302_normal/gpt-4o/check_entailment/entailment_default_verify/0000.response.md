The original assessment suggests that the provided function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Upon reviewing the code, problem description, and output hints, it appears that the function indeed maintains a binary search approach that is adjusted to find the first occurrence of a target value in a sorted array, handling duplicate values correctly. 

The key insight into why this implementation works correctly for finding the first occurrence lies in how it handles the case when `arr[mid]` equals the target. Instead of immediately returning `mid`, it updates `result` to `mid` and then moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures the search continues to the left of `mid` to find an earlier occurrence of the target, if any. 

The output hints provided align with this understanding, emphasizing that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target in the sorted list if it exists, otherwise returns -1, without modifying the input list or target value.

Given the problem description asks for the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, and considering the provided code and output hints, the function appears to meet these requirements. It correctly implements a binary search algorithm adjusted for finding the first occurrence of a target in a sorted array, handles duplicate targets, and does not modify the input.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the corrected assessment remains the same.

Final: **True**
