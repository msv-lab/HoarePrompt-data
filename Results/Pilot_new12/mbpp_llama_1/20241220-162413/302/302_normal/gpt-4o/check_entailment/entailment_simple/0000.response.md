Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. It uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the `low` and `high` pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively, and sets the `result` variable to -1, which will store the index of the first occurrence of the target element if found.

2. **Binary Search**: The program enters a while loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`. Inside the loop, it calculates the `mid` index and compares the middle element to the target element.

3. **Found Target**: If the middle element is equal to the target element, it updates the `result` variable with the `mid` index and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the search continues to the left of the current middle element to find the first occurrence of the target element.

4. **Not Found Target**: If the middle element is less than the target element, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`. If the middle element is greater than the target element, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.

5. **Return Result**: After the loop exits, the program returns the `result` variable, which stores the index of the first occurrence of the target element if found, or -1 if the target element is not found in the array.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1.
* If the target element is found, it returns the index of its first occurrence.
* If the target element appears multiple times in the array, it returns the index of its first occurrence.

The program's use of a modified binary search algorithm ensures that it has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the input array. This makes it efficient for large input arrays.

Overall, the program is correct, efficient, and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
