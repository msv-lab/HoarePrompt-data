Correctness: **True**

The given Python program implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It then enters a while loop, which continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` and compares the element at `mid` with the target element.
4. If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, it updates the `result` with `mid` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This is because there could be more occurrences of the target element to the left of `mid`, and we want to find the first occurrence.
5. If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`, because all elements to the left of `mid` are less than the target.
6. If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`, because all elements to the right of `mid` are greater than the target.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- If the target element is present in the array, it finds the index of the first occurrence.
- If the target element is not present in the array, it returns `-1`.
- If the target element is present multiple times in the array, it finds the index of the first occurrence.
- If the array is empty or contains only one element, the program handles these cases correctly.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target element is the first or last element in the array.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
