Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

The provided program uses a modified binary search algorithm to achieve this. It maintains a `result` variable to store the index of the first occurrence of the target element. When a match is found, it updates the `result` and moves the `high` pointer to the left to continue searching for the first occurrence on the left side. If the target is not found, the `result` remains -1.

The program handles the case where the input list `arr` is empty implicitly, as the binary search algorithm will terminate immediately and return -1.

The program also preserves the original state of the input list `arr` and the `target` value, as required.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various scenarios, including finding the first occurrence of a repeated element, finding an element in a list with no repeated elements, and finding an element in a list with repeated elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all potential cases.
