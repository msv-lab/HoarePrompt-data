You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It then enters a while loop, which continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` and compares the element at `mid` with the target element.
4. If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, it updates the `result` with `mid` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This is because there could be more occurrences of the target element to the left of `mid`, and we want to find the first occurrence.
5. If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it moves the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`, because all elements to the left of `mid` are less than the target.
6. If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`, because all elements to the right of `mid` are greater than the target.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- If the target element is present in the array, it finds the index of the first occurrence.
- If the target element is not present in the array, it returns `-1`.
- If the target element is present multiple times in the array, it finds the index of the first occurrence.
- If the array is empty or contains only one element, the program handles these cases correctly.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target element is the first or last element in the array.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target` as parameters, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if it exists, otherwise returns -1. This index corresponds to the position where `target` should be located in the sorted list to maintain sorted order, specifically it is the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the original `arr` if found. If the input list `arr` is empty, the function will return -1. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the `target` value, preserving their original state. After the function concludes, the state of the program will be: the original list `arr` remains unchanged, the `target` value remains unchanged, and the returned index indicates the position of `target` in `arr` if it exists or -1 if it does not.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
