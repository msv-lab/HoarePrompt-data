Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I have analyzed the program's behavior and reasoning.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct (**True**). Upon reviewing the code and annotations, I agree with this assessment. The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

The annotations provided align with the expected behavior of the program. Before the function call, `arr` is indeed a sorted list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After the loop, `result` is correctly set to the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the original `arr` if it exists, or `-1` otherwise. The loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`, ensuring that the entire array is searched.

The original assessment provides a detailed explanation of how the function works, including the initialization of pointers, the while loop, and the handling of duplicate targets. The unit tests also validate this behavior, demonstrating the function's correctness for various scenarios.

I did not find any evidence in the annotations or the code that contradicts the original assessment. Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
