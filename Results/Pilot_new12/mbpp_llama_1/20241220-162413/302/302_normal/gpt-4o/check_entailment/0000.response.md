Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why it works:

- It starts by initializing two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
- It maintains a `result` variable to store the index of the target element if found.
- The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and compares the element at this index to the target.
- If `arr[mid]` equals the target, it updates `result` to `mid` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the function continues searching for a potential occurrence of the target to the left of `mid`, which could be the first occurrence if there are duplicate targets.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, it adjusts `low` to `mid + 1`, effectively searching the right half of the array.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, it adjusts `high` to `mid - 1`, focusing the search on the left half.
- Once the loop ends, it returns `result`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the target if found, or `-1` if not found.

This logic ensures that the function will always find the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array if it exists, handling cases with duplicate targets correctly by continuing to search to the left after finding a match.

The provided unit tests also validate this behavior, demonstrating the function's correctness for various scenarios. Without being able to identify a case where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct.
