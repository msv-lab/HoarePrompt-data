You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's why it works:

- It starts by initializing two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
- It maintains a `result` variable to store the index of the target element if found.
- The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and compares the element at this index to the target.
- If `arr[mid]` equals the target, it updates `result` to `mid` and moves the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`. This ensures that the function continues searching for a potential occurrence of the target to the left of `mid`, which could be the first occurrence if there are duplicate targets.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, it adjusts `low` to `mid + 1`, effectively searching the right half of the array.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, it adjusts `high` to `mid - 1`, focusing the search on the left half.
- Once the loop ends, it returns `result`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the target if found, or `-1` if not found.

This logic ensures that the function will always find the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array if it exists, handling cases with duplicate targets correctly by continuing to search to the left after finding a match.

The provided unit tests also validate this behavior, demonstrating the function's correctness for various scenarios. Without being able to identify a case where the function does not behave as expected according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `high` is less than `low`, `result` is the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the original `arr` if it exists, otherwise -1, `arr` remains a sorted list of integers, and `target` remains an integer.
    return result
    #The program returns the index of the target element in the sorted list 'arr' if it exists, otherwise -1


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
