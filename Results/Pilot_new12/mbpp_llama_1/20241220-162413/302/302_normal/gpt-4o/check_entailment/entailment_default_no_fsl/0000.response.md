Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a binary search algorithm that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given target number in a sorted array. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `arr` and a target number `target` as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` if it exists, otherwise returns -1.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target is found. If the target is found, the algorithm updates the result and moves the search interval to the left half to find the first occurrence of the target.

The code handles the following cases correctly:

* When the target is present in the array, it returns the index of the first occurrence.
* When the target is not present in the array, it returns -1.
* When the input array is empty, it returns -1.
* When the target is at the start or end of the array, it returns the correct index.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and do not indicate any cases where the code does not work as expected. The code also does not modify the input list or target value, preserving their original state.

Therefore, the code is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case.
