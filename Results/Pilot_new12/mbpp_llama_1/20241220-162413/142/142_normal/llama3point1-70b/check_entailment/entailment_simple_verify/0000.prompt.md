You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether all items in a given list `lst` are equal to a specified `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the given element.

The function works as follows:
- It iterates over each item in the list `lst`.
- For each item, it checks if the item is equal to the given `element`.
- The `all()` function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the `element` (i.e., all comparisons return `True`).
- If at least one item is not equal to the `element`, the `all()` function will short-circuit and return `False`.

This approach correctly implements the problem description's requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

It handles various edge cases correctly:
- An empty list will cause `all()` to return `True`, which aligns with the mathematical concept that "all" elements in an empty set satisfy any condition (vacuous truth).
- A list with a single element will return `True` if that element matches the given element and `False` otherwise.
- Lists with multiple elements are checked exhaustively, ensuring that all elements must match the given element to return `True`.

Given that this function behaves as expected for all potential cases, both in terms of normal operation and edge cases, the program can be considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared to the elements in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all elements in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
