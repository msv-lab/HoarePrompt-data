Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It checks whether all items in the given list are equal to the specified element and returns `True` if they are all equal, and `False` otherwise. 

The `all()` function in Python returns `True` if all items in an iterable are true. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that compares each item in the list to the given element. If any item in the list is not equal to the element, the `all()` function will short-circuit and return `False`. If the list is empty, `all()` will return `True` because there are no items that are not equal to the element. 

The code also handles lists of any size and elements of any comparable type. The use of the `==` operator allows for comparison of various types, including integers, floats, strings, and more. The function does not modify the original list, as it only accesses the list elements for comparison purposes.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the code provided is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
