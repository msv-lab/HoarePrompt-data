Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks if all elements in a given list are equal to a specified element. The `all()` function is used with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the given element. The function returns `True` if all elements are equal and `False` otherwise.

The code handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and accommodates elements of any comparable type. The output hints agree with the code and indicate that it behaves as expected in all cases.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, we don't need to consider cases where the input is not a list or an empty list. The `all()` function will return `True` for an empty list, which is the correct behavior.

For example, if the input list is empty, the function will return `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element. If the input list contains multiple elements, the function will return `True` only if all elements are equal to the given element.

In general, the code is correct and will work as expected for every potential case, assuming valid input.
