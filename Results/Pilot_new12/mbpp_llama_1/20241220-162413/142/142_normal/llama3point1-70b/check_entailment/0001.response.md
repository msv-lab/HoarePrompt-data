Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the given list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. The function utilizes the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the given element. If any item in the list is not equal to the element, the `all` function will short-circuit and return `False`. If all items match the element, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly handles various edge cases, such as an empty list (in which case `all` returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element), a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness:
- `func_1([1, 1, 1], 1)` returns `True`
- `func_1([1, 2, 1], 1)` returns `False`
- `func_1([], 1)` returns `True` (as there are no elements to compare)
- `func_1([1], 1)` returns `True`

Given that the function behaves as expected for the described problem across these and other potential cases, it is concluded that the program is correct.
