Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes in a list `lst` and an element `element` as inputs and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: As per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, we don't need to handle cases where the input is not a list or an empty list.

2. **Functionality**: The function uses the built-in Python function `all()` in combination with a generator expression to check if all elements in the list are equal to the given element.

   - `all()` returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true.
   - The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value represents whether an item in the list is equal to the given element.
   - If all items in the list are equal to the given element, `all()` will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

Since the function correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element and returns the expected result, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Example use cases:
```python
print(func_1([1, 1, 1], 1))  # Returns: True
print(func_1([1, 2, 1], 1))  # Returns: False
print(func_1(["a", "a", "a"], "a"))  # Returns: True
print(func_1(["a", "b", "a"], "a"))  # Returns: False
```
In all these cases, the function behaves as expected and returns the correct result.
