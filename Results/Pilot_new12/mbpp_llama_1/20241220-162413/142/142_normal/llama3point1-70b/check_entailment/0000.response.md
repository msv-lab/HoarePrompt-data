Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether all items in a given list `lst` are equal to a specified `element`. It uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the given element.

The function works as follows:
- It iterates over each item in the list `lst`.
- For each item, it checks if the item is equal to the given `element`.
- The `all()` function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the `element` (i.e., all comparisons return `True`).
- If at least one item is not equal to the `element`, the `all()` function will short-circuit and return `False`.

This approach correctly implements the problem description's requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

It handles various edge cases correctly:
- An empty list will cause `all()` to return `True`, which aligns with the mathematical concept that "all" elements in an empty set satisfy any condition (vacuous truth).
- A list with a single element will return `True` if that element matches the given element and `False` otherwise.
- Lists with multiple elements are checked exhaustively, ensuring that all elements must match the given element to return `True`.

Given that this function behaves as expected for all potential cases, both in terms of normal operation and edge cases, the program can be considered correct.
