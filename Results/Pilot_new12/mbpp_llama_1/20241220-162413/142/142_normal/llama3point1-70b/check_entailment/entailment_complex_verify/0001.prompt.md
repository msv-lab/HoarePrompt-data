You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the given list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. The function utilizes the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the given element. If any item in the list is not equal to the element, the `all` function will short-circuit and return `False`. If all items match the element, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly handles various edge cases, such as an empty list (in which case `all` returns `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element), a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements.

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness:
- `func_1([1, 1, 1], 1)` returns `True`
- `func_1([1, 2, 1], 1)` returns `False`
- `func_1([], 1)` returns `True` (as there are no elements to compare)
- `func_1([1], 1)` returns `True`

Given that the function behaves as expected for the described problem across these and other potential cases, it is concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared to the elements in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all elements in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if all elements in a given list are equal to a specified element, returning True if they are all equal and False otherwise, handling lists of any size, including empty lists, and accommodating elements of any comparable type, with no modification to the original list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
