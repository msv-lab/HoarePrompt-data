Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the task described in the problem description. It checks whether all items in the given list `lst` are equal to the specified element `element`. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Comparison**: The function uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to compare each item in the list `lst` to the given `element`. This comparison is done using the `==` operator, which works correctly for all types of comparable objects in Python.

2. **Handling Lists of Any Size**: The `all()` function in Python returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If the iterable is empty (which would be the case for an empty list), `all()` returns `True` because there are no false values. This behavior aligns with the problem description's requirement to handle lists of any size, including empty lists.

3. **Handling Elements of Any Comparable Type**: Python's `==` operator can compare objects of any type that supports comparison, including but not limited to integers, floats, strings, and custom objects that define `__eq__` methods. This means `func_1` can handle elements of any comparable type, as required.

4. **No Modification to the Original List**: The function does not modify the original list `lst`. It only iterates over the list's elements to perform comparisons, leaving the list unchanged.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if all elements in the list are equal to the specified element and `False` otherwise, exactly as specified in the problem description.

Given that the function behaves as expected for all potential valid inputs (assuming valid input as per the problem statement), and considering the explanations above, the function correctly implements the task described in the problem description.
