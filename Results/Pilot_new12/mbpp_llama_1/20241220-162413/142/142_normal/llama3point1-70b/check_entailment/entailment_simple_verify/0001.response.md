The original assessment is that the correctness of the program is **True**. Upon analyzing the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version, it appears that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description requires a function that checks whether all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The provided Python function `func_1` utilizes the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the given element.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if all elements in the list are equal to the specified element and `False` otherwise.

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's behavior, including its handling of edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements.

There is no evidence in the annotated version that contradicts the original assessment. The annotations provided match the expected behavior of the function as described in the problem description and the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same.

Final: **True**
