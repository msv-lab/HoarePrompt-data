Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness appears to be accurate. 

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the given list `lst` are equal to the specified `element` by utilizing the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression. This implementation correctly handles various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with multiple elements.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the described problem, returning `True` if all elements in the list are equal to the specified element and `False` otherwise. The hints also mention that the function can handle lists of any size, including empty lists, and accommodate elements of any comparable type, without modifying the original list.

Given the evidence from the code, the output hints, and the problem description, there is no reason to believe that the original assessment is inaccurate. The function's behavior aligns with the expected functionality described in the problem description and the output hints.

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's ability to handle various edge cases, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. The assessment also correctly notes that the function will short-circuit and return `False` as soon as it encounters an item that is not equal to the given element, which is a key aspect of the `all` function's behavior.

Therefore, based on the evidence available, the final assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as accurate.

Final: **True**
