The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `element`. `lst` is a list, and `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements in `lst`. After executing the function body, the function returns `True` if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and `False` otherwise.**
