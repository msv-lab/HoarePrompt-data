The code checks if all elements in the list `lst` are equal to the `element`. 

Since `lst` is a list and `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements in `lst`, the comparison `item == element` will be true if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`, and false otherwise.

The function `all()` returns true if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)`) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns false.

So, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.

Output State: **The program returns True if all elements in list 'lst' are equal to 'element', False otherwise**
