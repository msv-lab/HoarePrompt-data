The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `element`. `lst` is a list, and `element` is any type of object that can be compared with the elements of `lst`. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value based on the comparison of `element` with the elements in `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an `element`, and return `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element` (or if `lst` is empty), and `False` otherwise.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returns `True` if all elements in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty, and `False` otherwise.**
