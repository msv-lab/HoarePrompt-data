According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list and `element` is any type of object, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `lst` must have at least 1 element and `item` is the first element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `element` is any type of object, `item` is the first element in the list**
