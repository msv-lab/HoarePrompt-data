Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It checks if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The function iterates over each item in the list, and as soon as it encounters an item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully checks all items without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including when the list contains elements not equal to the given element and when all elements in the list are equal to the given element. Additionally, the function handles lists of different data types (e.g., strings and integers), as shown in the test cases.

To further verify the function's correctness, consider the following edge cases:

1. An empty list: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no items in the list that do not match the given element. Upon inspection, the function correctly handles this case, as the `for` loop will not execute, and the function will return `True`.

2. A list with a single element: The function should return `True` if the single element matches the given element and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles this case, as the single element will be compared to the given element.

3. A list with duplicate elements: The function should return `True` if all duplicate elements match the given element and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles this case, as it checks each element individually.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and no counterexample can be found, it is concluded that the program is correct.
