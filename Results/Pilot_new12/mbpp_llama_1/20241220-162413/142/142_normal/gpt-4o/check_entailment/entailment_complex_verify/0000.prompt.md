You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, takes a list `lst` and an element as input and checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates over each item in the list, and if it finds any item that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: Although the code does not explicitly handle empty lists, it will still work correctly because the `for` loop will simply not execute, and the function will return `True` (since no items were found that are not equal to the given element).
* Lists with a single element: If the single element is equal to the given element, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.
* Lists with multiple elements: The function will correctly return `True` if all elements are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.
* Lists with elements of different data types: Since Python is dynamically typed, the function will correctly compare elements of different data types, returning `True` if all elements are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise.

Overall, the provided implementation is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with the elements of lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where either all elements are equal to `element` if the list is not empty, or `lst` is empty (in which case the condition is considered true by default due to the lack of elements to compare), and `element` remains unchanged. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it implies all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element` if the list is not empty, or the list `lst` is empty
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if all elements in a given list (`lst`) are equal to a specified `element`. If the list is empty, it returns `True` by default. For non-empty lists, it returns `True` if all elements match the specified `element` and `False` otherwise. The function leaves the input `lst` and `element` unchanged. It handles lists of any size (including empty lists) and elements of any comparable type. The function performs a linear search through the list, comparing each element to the specified `element`, and returns as soon as it finds a mismatch or completes the comparison without finding any mismatches.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
