Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list, and as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. This is exactly as described in the problem description.

The code also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list, lists of any size, and elements of any comparable type. For an empty list, since there are no elements to compare, the function will not enter the for loop and will return `True` by default, which is the correct behavior according to the output hints.

The output hints agree with the code's behavior and do not indicate any potential issues or edge cases that the code does not handle. The provided assertions also validate the code's correctness for different scenarios. Therefore, based on the given problem description, code, and output hints, the code is correct for every potential case.
