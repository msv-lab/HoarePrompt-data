Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function iterates over each item in the list. If it finds an item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. This correctly handles the case where not all items in the list are equal to the given element.

2. If the function iterates over the entire list without finding any items that do not match the given element, it returns `True`. This correctly handles the case where all items in the list are equal to the given element.

3. The function also correctly handles the case where the input list is empty. In this case, the function will not enter the `for` loop and will immediately return `True`, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

4. The function does not modify the input list or element, which is also in line with the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, and it handles all possible cases, including empty lists and lists of any size.
