You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It checks if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The function iterates over each item in the list, and as soon as it encounters an item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully checks all items without finding a mismatch, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including when the list contains elements not equal to the given element and when all elements in the list are equal to the given element. Additionally, the function handles lists of different data types (e.g., strings and integers), as shown in the test cases.

To further verify the function's correctness, consider the following edge cases:

1. An empty list: In this case, the function should return `True` because there are no items in the list that do not match the given element. Upon inspection, the function correctly handles this case, as the `for` loop will not execute, and the function will return `True`.

2. A list with a single element: The function should return `True` if the single element matches the given element and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles this case, as the single element will be compared to the given element.

3. A list with duplicate elements: The function should return `True` if all duplicate elements match the given element and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles this case, as it checks each element individually.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and no counterexample can be found, it is concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with the elements of lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where either all elements are equal to `element` if the list is not empty, or `lst` is empty (in which case the condition is considered true by default due to the lack of elements to compare), and `element` remains unchanged. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it implies all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element` if the list is not empty, or the list `lst` is empty


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
