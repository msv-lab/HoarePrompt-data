Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment seems to accurately capture the functionality and correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function iterates through the list, comparing each item to the given element, and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that does not match, or returns `True` if the loop completes without finding any non-matching items. This behavior aligns with the problem description's requirement for checking whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by highlighting the state of the program right before the function call, during the execution of the loop, and after the loop completes. These annotations clearly indicate that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Specifically, the annotations clarify the conditions under which the function returns `True` (i.e., when all elements in the list are equal to the given element, or when the list is empty) and `False` (i.e., when at least one element in the list is not equal to the given element).

Given that the function's behavior matches the requirements outlined in the problem description, and considering the additional insights provided by the annotated version, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.

Final: **True**
