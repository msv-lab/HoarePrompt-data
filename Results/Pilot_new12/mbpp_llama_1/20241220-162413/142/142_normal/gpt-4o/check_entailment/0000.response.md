Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, takes a list `lst` and an element as input and checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function iterates over each item in the list, and if it finds any item that is not equal to the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: Although the code does not explicitly handle empty lists, it will still work correctly because the `for` loop will simply not execute, and the function will return `True` (since no items were found that are not equal to the given element).
* Lists with a single element: If the single element is equal to the given element, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.
* Lists with multiple elements: The function will correctly return `True` if all elements are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.
* Lists with elements of different data types: Since Python is dynamically typed, the function will correctly compare elements of different data types, returning `True` if all elements are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise.

Overall, the provided implementation is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
