Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The function iterates over each item in the list and immediately returns `False` if it finds an item that does not match the specified element. If it iterates over the entire list without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. This logic aligns with the problem description.

The function handles lists of any size, including empty lists, correctly. For an empty list, it will not enter the loop and will therefore return `True` by default, which is in line with the output hints. The function also handles elements of any comparable type, as demonstrated by the provided assertions that test lists of both strings and integers.

Since the program description does not specify any edge cases that the provided function does not handle, and assuming that the input will always be a valid list and an element (as per the problem statement), the function is correct for every potential case as described. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, further supporting its correctness.
