You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with the elements of lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where either all elements are equal to `element` if the list is not empty, or `lst` is empty (in which case the condition is considered true by default due to the lack of elements to compare), and `element` remains unchanged. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it implies all elements in `lst` are equal to `element`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list `lst` are equal to `element` if the list is not empty, or the list `lst` is empty
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if all elements in a given list (`lst`) are equal to a specified `element`. If the list is empty, it returns `True` by default. For non-empty lists, it returns `True` if all elements match the specified `element` and `False` otherwise. The function leaves the input `lst` and `element` unchanged. It handles lists of any size (including empty lists) and elements of any comparable type. The function performs a linear search through the list, comparing each element to the specified `element`, and returns as soon as it finds a mismatch or completes the comparison without finding any mismatches.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
