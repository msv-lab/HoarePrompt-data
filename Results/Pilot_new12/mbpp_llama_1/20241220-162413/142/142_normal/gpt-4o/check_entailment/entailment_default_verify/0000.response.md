Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I have evaluated the program's behavior and reasoning. The original assessment concludes that the program is correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.

After analyzing the code and output hints, I agree with the original assessment. The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The function handles various cases, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. It also correctly returns `True` for empty lists since there are no items that are not equal to the given element.

The output hints support the correctness of the program by stating that the function returns `True` if all elements match the specified `element` and `False` otherwise. The hints also mention that the function handles lists of any size and elements of any comparable type, which matches the behavior of the provided code.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment because it accurately reflects the behavior of the provided code. The code correctly implements the problem description, and the output hints provide additional evidence to support its correctness.

Final: **True**
