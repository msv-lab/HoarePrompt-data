Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an `element` as input. It iterates over each item in the list, checking if any item is not equal to the given `element`. If it finds such an item, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all elements in the list are equal to the given `element`.

2. **Correct Handling of Empty List**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle an empty list, the provided function correctly returns `True` in this scenario. This is because the `for` loop does not execute when the list is empty, and the function proceeds to return `True`, implying that either all elements (none, in this case) are equal to the `element` or that the absence of elements means the condition is considered true by default.

3. **Correctness for Non-Empty Lists**: For non-empty lists, the function correctly checks each element against the provided `element`. If any element does not match, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any non-matching elements, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the list are indeed equal to the given `element`.

4. **Input Validation Assumption**: Since the problem assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., `lst` will always be a list and `element` will be a comparable object), the function does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs. It is designed under the premise that its preconditions will always be met, focusing solely on the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Given these points, the function accurately implements the behavior described in the problem statement. It checks if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise, including handling the case where the list might be empty as a valid scenario without explicitly defined behavior from the problem description.
