The function checks if all elements in a given list (`lst`) are equal to a specified `element`. If the list is empty, it returns `True` by default. For non-empty lists, it returns `True` if all elements match the specified `element` and `False` otherwise. The function leaves the input `lst` and `element` unchanged. It handles lists of any size (including empty lists) and elements of any comparable type. The function performs a linear search through the list, comparing each element to the specified `element`, and returns as soon as it finds a mismatch or completes the comparison without finding any mismatches.
