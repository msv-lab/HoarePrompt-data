The original assessment states that the program is correct, which aligns with the provided code and problem description. The code utilizes the `bisect` module, specifically the `bisect_right` function, to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This approach is efficient and accurate for maintaining the sorted order.

The output hints further support the program's correctness by describing its functionality and handling of edge cases, such as an empty input list, a list with duplicate elements, and a value that is less than or equal to all elements in the list. The `bisect_right` function is designed to work with sorted lists and provides the correct index for inserting a value to maintain the sorted order.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid and the program handles various edge cases correctly, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, and the output hints provide additional evidence of its correctness.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
