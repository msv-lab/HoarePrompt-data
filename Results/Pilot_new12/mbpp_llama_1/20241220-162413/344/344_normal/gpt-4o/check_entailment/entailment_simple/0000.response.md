Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list and a value as input, and it correctly returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to the right in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. 

This is achieved using the `bisect.bisect_right` function, which returns the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain sorted order. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where `value` should be inserted to the right of equal elements, which is equivalent to the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`.

For example, given the sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value `3`, `bisect.bisect_right` correctly returns `2`, because `3` should be inserted at index `2` in the sorted list to maintain sorted order. 

Another example, given the sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value `7`, `bisect.bisect_right` correctly returns `4`, because `7` should be inserted at index `4` (the end of the list) to maintain sorted order. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and verify that the function behaves as expected. 

In summary, the program correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, and therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
