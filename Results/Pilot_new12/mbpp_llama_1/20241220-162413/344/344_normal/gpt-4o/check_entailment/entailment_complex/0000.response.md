Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. It utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to the right in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order.

The program handles edge cases as described in the problem description, including:

1.  An empty input list: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle an empty list, the `bisect.bisect_right` function will return 0, indicating that the value should be inserted at the beginning of the list, which is correct.
2.  A list with duplicate elements: The `bisect.bisect_right` function will return the index of the first element greater than the value, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order.
3.  A value that is less than or equal to all elements in the list: The `bisect.bisect_right` function will return 0, indicating that the value should be inserted at the beginning of the list, which is correct.
4.  A value that is greater than all elements in the list: The `bisect.bisect_right` function will return the length of the input list, indicating that the value should be appended to the end, which is correct.

The program assumes that the input list is already sorted and does not modify the original list. It correctly returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to the right in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This index represents the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description.
