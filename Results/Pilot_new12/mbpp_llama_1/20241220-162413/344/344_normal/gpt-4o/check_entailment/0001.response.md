Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function works by returning the index where the value should be inserted to the right of any existing equal elements, which is exactly what is described in the problem statement.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function is working as expected. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct index for inserting `6` into the sorted list. Similarly, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct index for inserting `3` into the sorted list.

After analyzing the code and the problem statement, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to handle edge cases such as inserting at the beginning or end of the list, and the unit tests provided cover these cases.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
