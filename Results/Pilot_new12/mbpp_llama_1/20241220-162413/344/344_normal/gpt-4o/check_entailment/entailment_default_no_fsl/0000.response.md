Correctness: **True**

The code provided uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function, which is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list to maintain the sorted order. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, describing how it handles various edge cases, including empty input lists, lists with duplicate elements, and values that are less than or equal to all elements in the list, as well as values greater than all elements in the list.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code provided seems to correctly implement the required functionality for every potential case. It correctly identifies the insertion point for a given value in a sorted list, handles edge cases appropriately, and does not modify the original list.

Additionally, the provided unit tests further confirm the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios, such as inserting a value that is greater than all elements in the list, inserting a value that is between two existing elements, and inserting a value that is greater than some but not all elements in the list.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the code correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement, and it handles all potential cases as expected.
