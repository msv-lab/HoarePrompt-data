Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from Python's bisect module, which returns the index where the value should be inserted to the right in the sorted list to maintain the sorted order. This index represents the number of elements in the sorted list that are less than the value. 

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function handles various edge cases, including an empty input list, a list with duplicate elements, and a value that is less than or equal to all elements in the list. The function also handles cases where the value is greater than all elements in the list, in which case it returns the length of the input list, indicating that the value should be appended to the end.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further confirm the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and verify that the function returns the expected output. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or an empty list. The function is designed to work with a sorted list, and the bisect module's implementation ensures that the function works correctly for all valid inputs. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description and output hints.
