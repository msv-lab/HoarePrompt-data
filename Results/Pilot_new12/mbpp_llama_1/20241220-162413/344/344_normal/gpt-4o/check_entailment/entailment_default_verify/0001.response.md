The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is used to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, which aligns with the problem description.

The output hints also support the original assessment, as they describe the function's behavior in various scenarios, including edge cases. The hints mention that the function assumes the input list is already sorted, does not modify the original list, and handles cases where the value is less than or equal to all elements in the list, as well as cases where the value is greater than all elements in the list.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function is working as expected. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct index for inserting `6` into the sorted list. Similarly, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct index for inserting `3` into the sorted list.

Based on the analysis, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the `bisect.bisect_right` function is a standard and well-tested function in Python that is specifically designed for finding insertion points in sorted lists.

Final: **True**
