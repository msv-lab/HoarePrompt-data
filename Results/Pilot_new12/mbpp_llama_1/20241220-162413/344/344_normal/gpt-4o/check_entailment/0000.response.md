Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect` module, which is a built-in module in Python that provides functions to manipulate sorted lists. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. 

The function `func_1` takes a sorted list and a value as input and returns the right insertion point for the value in the sorted list. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is used to find this insertion point.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function. For example, when the input is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the function returns `4`, which is the correct right insertion point to maintain the sorted order. Similarly, when the value is `3`, the function returns `2`, which is also correct.

The `bisect_right` function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the value is already in the list or when it is greater than all elements in the list. 

In general, the `bisect` module is designed to work with sorted lists and provides efficient ways to find insertion points. Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
