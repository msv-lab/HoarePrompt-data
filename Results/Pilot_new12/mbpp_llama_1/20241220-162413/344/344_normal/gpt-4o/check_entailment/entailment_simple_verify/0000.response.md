The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code uses the `bisect` module, which is a built-in module in Python that provides functions to manipulate sorted lists. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the state of the program at different points. The annotation before the function call indicates that `sorted_list` is a sorted list of elements and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`. This assumption is reasonable, as the problem description assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The annotation after the function call provides further clarification on the return value of the `bisect_right` function, stating that it returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to the right in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This is consistent with the expected behavior of the `bisect_right` function.

Based on the annotations and the original assessment, it appears that the program correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
