The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a sorted list of elements, and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`. The function returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to the right in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This index is determined by the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements less than or equal to the value.**
