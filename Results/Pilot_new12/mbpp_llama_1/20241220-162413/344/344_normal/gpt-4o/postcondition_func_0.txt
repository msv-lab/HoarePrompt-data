The function accepts a sorted list (`sorted_list`) and a comparable value (`value`), and returns the index where the `value` should be inserted to the right in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This index represents the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`. The function assumes that the input list is already sorted, and does not modify the original list. It handles edge cases, including an empty input list, a list with duplicate elements, and a value that is less than or equal to all elements in the list. The function also handles cases where the value is greater than all elements in the list, in which case it returns the length of the input list, indicating that the value should be appended to the end.
