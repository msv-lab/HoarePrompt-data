Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order with at least 2 elements, `value` is an element comparable with the elements in `sorted_list`, and `i` is 1. If the second element of `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the program returns 1. Otherwise, the program proceeds with no specified return, maintaining the initial conditions of `sorted_list`, `value`, and `i`.***
