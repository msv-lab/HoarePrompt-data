According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_list`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `sorted_list` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0, which is the starting index of the range.
State: **`sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order that must have at least 1 element, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, `i` is 0**
