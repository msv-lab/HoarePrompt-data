Postcondition: **`sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order with at least 3 elements, `value` is an element comparable with the elements in `sorted_list`, and `i` is 2. If `sorted_list[2]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the program returns 2; otherwise, no specific action is taken, leaving the variables in their initial state except for any implicit changes due to the conditional check.**
