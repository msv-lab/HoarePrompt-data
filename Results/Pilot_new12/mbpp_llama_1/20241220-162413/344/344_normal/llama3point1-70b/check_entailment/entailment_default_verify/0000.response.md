Based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, I agree with the original assessment. The function `func_1` appears to correctly locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. It iterates through the sorted list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the sorted list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

The output hints support this assessment, as they describe the function's behavior in various edge cases and confirm that it returns the correct index for the insertion point. The function handles cases where the value is less than the first element, equal to an existing element, or greater than all elements in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains a single element.

The original assessment is accurate because it provides a step-by-step breakdown of the function's behavior and correctly identifies the cases that the function handles. The assessment also notes that the function returns the correct index for the insertion point in all cases, which is consistent with the problem description and output hints.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
