Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` appears to correctly locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. It does this by iterating through the sorted list and returning the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the sorted list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function starts by iterating through the sorted list.
2. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value.
3. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point.
4. If it iterates through the entire list without finding an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it means the specified value is greater than all elements in the list.
5. In this case, the function correctly returns the length of the sorted list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

This function handles all possible cases, including:

* The specified value is less than the first element in the list.
* The specified value is equal to an element in the list.
* The specified value is greater than an element in the list but less than another element in the list.
* The specified value is greater than all elements in the list.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, and it handles all possible cases.
