Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Here's why it meets the requirements in the problem description:

1. **Handling edge cases**: The function correctly handles cases where the value is less than the first element, equal to an existing element, or greater than all elements in the list. If the value is less than or equal to the first element, the function returns 0. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the total number of elements in the list.

2. **Finding the correct insertion point**: For all other cases, the function returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value. This is achieved by iterating through the sorted list and returning the index `i` as soon as an element is found that is greater than or equal to the given value.

3. **Maintaining the original list**: The function does not modify the original sorted list, as required by the problem description.

4. **Handling empty lists and lists with single elements**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the function can handle these cases correctly. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is the correct insertion point for any value. If the list contains a single element, the function will return 0 if the value is less than or equal to the element, and 1 if the value is greater than the element.

5. **Assuming valid input**: As stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or not a valid value for comparison.

Overall, the provided Python program correctly implements the required functionality, meeting all the requirements specified in the problem description.
