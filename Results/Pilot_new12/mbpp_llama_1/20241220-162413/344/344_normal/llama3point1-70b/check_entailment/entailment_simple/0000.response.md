Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

Here's why:

- If the `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, the loop will complete without finding an element greater than or equal to `value`, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that `value` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain sorted order.

- If the `value` is greater than or equal to an element in `sorted_list`, the loop will find the first element that is greater than or equal to `value` and return its index, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

- If the `value` is equal to an element in `sorted_list`, the loop will still find the first occurrence of an element greater than or equal to `value`, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

The program handles all possible cases where the `value` can be inserted into the `sorted_list` while maintaining sorted order. Therefore, it meets the problem description and is correct. 

This function appears to implement a binary search-like algorithm but does so in a linear fashion. For large lists, a more efficient implementation might involve using a binary search to find the insertion point. However, for the purposes of correctness according to the problem description provided, this implementation is sufficient.
