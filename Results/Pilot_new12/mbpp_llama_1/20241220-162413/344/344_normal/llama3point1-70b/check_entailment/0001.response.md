Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two inputs: a sorted list and a value. The function iterates through the sorted list to find the right insertion point for the specified value in sorted order. 

This function works by iterating through the sorted list and checking each element. As soon as it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it returns the index of that element. This is because in a sorted list, all elements before this index are less than the specified value, so the specified value should be inserted at this index to maintain the sorted order. 

If the function iterates through the entire list without finding an element greater than or equal to the specified value, it means the specified value is greater than all elements in the list. In this case, the function returns the length of the list, indicating that the specified value should be inserted at the end of the list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the specified value is less than all elements in the list, it returns 0, indicating the value should be inserted at the beginning.
- If the specified value is equal to an element in the list, it returns the index of the first occurrence of that element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.
- If the specified value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, indicating the value should be inserted at the end.
- If the list is empty, the function returns 0, which is the correct insertion point because the value should be inserted as the first (and only) element.

Because the function correctly handles all potential cases, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
