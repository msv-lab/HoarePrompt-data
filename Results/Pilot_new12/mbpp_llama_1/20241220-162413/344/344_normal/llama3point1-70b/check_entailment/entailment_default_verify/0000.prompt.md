You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` appears to correctly locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. It does this by iterating through the sorted list and returning the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element is found, it returns the length of the sorted list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function starts by iterating through the sorted list.
2. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value.
3. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point.
4. If it iterates through the entire list without finding an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it means the specified value is greater than all elements in the list.
5. In this case, the function correctly returns the length of the sorted list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.

This function handles all possible cases, including:

* The specified value is less than the first element in the list.
* The specified value is equal to an element in the list.
* The specified value is greater than an element in the list but less than another element in the list.
* The specified value is greater than all elements in the list.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, and it handles all possible cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function inserts a given value into its correct position in a sorted list to maintain sorted order and returns the index of that position. It accepts a sorted list and a value as input, and returns an integer representing the index where the value should be inserted. The function handles edge cases where the value is less than the first element, equal to an existing element, or greater than all elements in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. If the value is less than or equal to the first element, the function returns 0. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the total number of elements in the list. For all other cases, the function returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value. The function does not modify the original sorted list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
