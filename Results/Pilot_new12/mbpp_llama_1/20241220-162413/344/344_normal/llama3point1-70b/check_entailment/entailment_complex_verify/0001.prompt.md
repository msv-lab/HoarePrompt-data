You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two inputs: a sorted list and a value. The function iterates through the sorted list to find the right insertion point for the specified value in sorted order. 

This function works by iterating through the sorted list and checking each element. As soon as it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it returns the index of that element. This is because in a sorted list, all elements before this index are less than the specified value, so the specified value should be inserted at this index to maintain the sorted order. 

If the function iterates through the entire list without finding an element greater than or equal to the specified value, it means the specified value is greater than all elements in the list. In this case, the function returns the length of the list, indicating that the specified value should be inserted at the end of the list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the specified value is less than all elements in the list, it returns 0, indicating the value should be inserted at the beginning.
- If the specified value is equal to an element in the list, it returns the index of the first occurrence of that element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.
- If the specified value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, indicating the value should be inserted at the end.
- If the list is empty, the function returns 0, which is the correct insertion point because the value should be inserted as the first (and only) element.

Because the function correctly handles all potential cases, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements in sorted order, and value is an element that can be compared with the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of elements in sorted order, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and if the loop completes without an explicit return, it implies all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`, or `i` would represent the index of the first element greater than or equal to `value` if such an element exists and the loop returns explicitly.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the total number of elements in the sorted list `sorted_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function inserts a given value into its correct position in a sorted list to maintain sorted order and returns the index of that position. It accepts a sorted list and a value as input, and returns an integer representing the index where the value should be inserted. The function handles edge cases where the value is less than the first element, equal to an existing element, or greater than all elements in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. If the value is less than or equal to the first element, the function returns 0. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the total number of elements in the list. For all other cases, the function returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value. The function does not modify the original sorted list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
