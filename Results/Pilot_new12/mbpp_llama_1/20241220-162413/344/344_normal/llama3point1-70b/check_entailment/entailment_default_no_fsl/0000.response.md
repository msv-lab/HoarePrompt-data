Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a correct implementation of the problem description. It iterates through the sorted list to find the correct insertion point for a specified value, maintaining the sorted order. The function handles edge cases such as the value being less than the first element, equal to an existing element, or greater than all elements in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains a single element.

Here's a breakdown of how the code handles different scenarios:

- If the value is less than or equal to the first element, the function returns 0, which is the correct insertion point.
- If the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the total number of elements in the list, which is the correct insertion point to maintain sorted order.
- For all other cases, the function returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value, ensuring that the sorted order is maintained after insertion.

Given the code's logic and the output hints provided, it seems that the function will work correctly for all potential cases, assuming the input is a valid sorted list and a value to be inserted. The function's design ensures that it will not modify the original sorted list, as required.

The code does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled according to the problem description. Therefore, based on the information provided, the code appears to be correct for all expected inputs and scenarios.
