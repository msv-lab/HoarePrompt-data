The function inserts a given value into its correct position in a sorted list to maintain sorted order and returns the index of that position. It accepts a sorted list and a value as input, and returns an integer representing the index where the value should be inserted. The function handles edge cases where the value is less than the first element, equal to an existing element, or greater than all elements in the list, as well as cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. If the value is less than or equal to the first element, the function returns 0. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the total number of elements in the list. For all other cases, the function returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value. The function does not modify the original sorted list.
