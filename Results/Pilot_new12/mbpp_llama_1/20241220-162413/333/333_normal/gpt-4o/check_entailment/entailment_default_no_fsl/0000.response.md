Correctness: **True**

The given code correctly implements a function to check if a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets. 

The function handles all three types of brackets: parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly brackets `{}`. It checks for two conditions that would indicate an unbalanced expression: 
1. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, indicating that there's no matching opening bracket.
2. If the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket, indicating a mismatched bracket.

The function returns `True` if all brackets are properly matched and `False` otherwise. The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various cases, including balanced and unbalanced expressions.

Since the program description assumes that the input will be valid and does not require error handling for non-string inputs or strings containing invalid characters, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case as per the problem description.
