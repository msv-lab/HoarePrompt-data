Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and then checks if the corresponding closing brackets are in the correct order. The program also handles the case when the stack is empty and a closing bracket is encountered, which is a crucial edge case.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It correctly handles the case when the input expression is empty, as the function will return True because the stack will be empty and the loop will not be executed.

2. It correctly handles the case when the input expression contains only opening brackets, as the function will return False because the stack will not be empty after the loop.

3. It correctly handles the case when the input expression contains only closing brackets, as the function will return False because it will try to pop from an empty stack when it encounters the first closing bracket.

4. It correctly handles the case when the input expression contains a mix of opening and closing brackets, as the function will return True if the brackets are balanced and False otherwise.

5. The function uses a dictionary to store the matching pairs of brackets, which makes it easy to add or remove bracket types if needed.

6. The function iterates over each character in the input expression, which ensures that it checks every bracket.

7. The function uses the stack data structure correctly, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when the corresponding closing bracket is encountered.

Overall, the program correctly checks whether a given expression is balanced or not, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
