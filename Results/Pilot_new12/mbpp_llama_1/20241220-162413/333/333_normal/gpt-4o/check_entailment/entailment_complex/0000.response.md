Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that checks if the given expression is balanced or not. The provided function, `func_1`, achieves this by using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the input string `expr`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty stack `stack` and a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
2. It iterates through each character `char` in the input string `expr`.
3. If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., it is a value in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it pushes `char` onto the stack.
4. If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., it is a key in the `matching_pairs` dictionary), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.
5. After iterating through all characters in the input string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets were properly matched with closing brackets, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets.

The function handles strings containing parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly brackets `{}`, and correctly identifies mismatched or unmatched brackets. The function's return value indicates whether the input string has a valid bracket sequence, with `True` indicating a valid sequence and `False` indicating an invalid sequence. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:

- `assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True`: The function correctly identifies the balanced expression.
- `assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False`: The function correctly identifies the unbalanced expression due to the mismatched bracket.
- `assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True`: The function correctly identifies the balanced expression with multiple bracket pairs.

Overall, the function implements a correct solution to the problem of checking if a given expression is balanced or not.
