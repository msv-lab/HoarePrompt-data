Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters with at least two characters removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If the next character `char` is in the values of `matching_pairs`, `stack` contains the previously appended characters and the current `char`. If `char` is in the keys of `matching_pairs`, the program checks if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character, in which case it returns False; otherwise, it continues execution without returning False. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the program continues execution without any changes.***
