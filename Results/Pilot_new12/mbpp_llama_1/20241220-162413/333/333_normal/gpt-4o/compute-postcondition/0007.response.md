Postcondition: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. The current value of `char` is one of the values in the keys of `matching_pairs`, specifically ')', ']', or '}'. The current state of `stack` is either empty or its top element does not match the current `char`, meaning if `stack` is not empty, the top element of `stack` is not equal to the value of `matching_pairs` at the key of the current `char`.**
