Given the current state of the program, where `expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of parentheses, and `char` is one of the closing parentheses that does not match the top element of `stack` (or `stack` is empty), the code simply returns `False`.

Output State: **The program returns False**
