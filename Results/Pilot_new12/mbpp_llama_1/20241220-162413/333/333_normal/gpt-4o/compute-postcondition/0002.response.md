According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expr`. If `expr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is an empty list, and `matching_pairs` is a dictionary. For the loop to execute, `expr` must have at least 1 character and `char` should be the first character in `expr`. 

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, `char` is the first character in `expr`**
