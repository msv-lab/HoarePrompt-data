To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given code `return stack == []` implies. This code checks if the `stack` is empty. 

Given that `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expr` were matched, and otherwise contains the unmatched opening brackets from the original string `expr`, the return statement will evaluate to `True` if `stack` is empty (meaning all brackets were matched) and `False` if `stack` is not empty (meaning there are unmatched opening brackets).

Thus, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in the expression `expr` were properly matched.

Output State: **The program returns True if all brackets in `expr` were matched, False otherwise**
