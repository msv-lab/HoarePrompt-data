The code `stack.append(char)` adds the current character `char` to the end of the list `stack`. Given the initial state, `expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, and `char` is the first character in `expr` which is one of the values '(', '[', or '{'. 

After executing the code, `stack` will contain the first character of `expr` which is `char`, and since `char` is one of '(', '[', or '{', the list `stack` will now hold one of these opening brackets.

The states of `expr`, `matching_pairs` are not affected, and `char` still holds its initial value. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is a list containing the first character of `expr` which is either '(', '[', or '{', `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, `char` is the first character in `expr` which is either '(', '[', or '{'.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `expr` and equals to `char` which is either '(', '[', or '{', `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, `char` is either '(', '[', or '{'**
