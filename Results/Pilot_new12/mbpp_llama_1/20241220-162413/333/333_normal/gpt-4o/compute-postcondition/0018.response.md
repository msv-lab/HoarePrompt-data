According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expr`. If `expr` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters with at least one character removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` remains unchanged as it is not dependent on the loop iteration, `char` is the last character processed in the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `expr` must have at least one more character, and `char` is the next character in the string.
State: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters with at least two characters removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, `char` is the next character in the string**
