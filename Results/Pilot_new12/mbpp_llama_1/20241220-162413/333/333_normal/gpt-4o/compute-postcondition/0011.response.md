Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, specifically ')', ']', or '}', then either the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current character. If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` values, specifically '(', '[', or '{', then `stack` is a list containing one element which is the first character of `expr` and equals to `char`. If `char` is not one of the values in `matching_pairs` and not one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, then the state remains unchanged as the if condition is not met.***
