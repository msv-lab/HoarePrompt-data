The code `stack.append(char)` adds the current character `char` to the end of the `stack` list. 

Given the initial state, if `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` values, specifically '(', '[', or '{', then `stack` is a list containing at least one element. After appending `char` to the stack, `stack` will contain at least the elements it had before plus the new character `char`. 

If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, specifically ')', ']', or '}', then either the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current character. However, in this case, the character is still appended to the stack. 

If `char` is not one of the values in `matching_pairs` and not one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, then the state remains unchanged as the if condition is not met, and `char` is the next character in the string. But `char` is still appended to the stack.

So, `expr` remains a non-empty string with at least one character removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` remains {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. The `stack` now contains the characters it had before plus the new character `char`. `char` is the current character being processed.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string with at least one character removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. `stack` contains the characters it had before plus the new character `char`, `char` is the current character being processed.**
