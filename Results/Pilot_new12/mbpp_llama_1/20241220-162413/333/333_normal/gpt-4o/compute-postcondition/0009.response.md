Postcondition: **`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, `char` is the first character in `expr` and the current value of `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs`, specifically '(', '[', or '{'. The stack is not empty and the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current character, i.e., `stack` is not empty and `stack.pop() == matching_pairs[char]`**
