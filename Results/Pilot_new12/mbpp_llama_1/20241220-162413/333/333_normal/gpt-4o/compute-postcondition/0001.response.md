The code defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing parentheses to their corresponding opening parentheses. This dictionary is used to keep track of the matching pairs of parentheses.

The initial state is: `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is an empty list.

After executing the code, the value of `matching_pairs` is `{'(': ')', ']': '[', '}': '{'}` is incorrect. Instead, `matching_pairs` is `{')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`.

The states of `expr` and `stack` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
