Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters with at least one character removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, specifically ')', ']', or '}', and either the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current character, then the program returns False. If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` values, specifically '(', '[', or '{', the state remains unchanged and the execution continues. If `char` is not one of the values in `matching_pairs` and not one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, then the state remains unchanged as the if condition is not met, and `char` is the next character in the string.***
