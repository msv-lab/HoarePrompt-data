Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses and/or other characters with at least one character removed from the beginning, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is one of the values in `matching_pairs` keys, specifically ')', ']', or '}', and either the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket for the current character, then the program returns False. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged and the execution continues.***
