You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks if a given expression is balanced or not. An expression is considered balanced if every opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '[') has a corresponding closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']') and the pairs of brackets are properly nested.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
3. The function then iterates over each character in the input expression. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes the bracket onto the stack.
4. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.
5. After iterating over all characters in the expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly. The function correctly handles expressions with multiple types of brackets, nested brackets, and expressions with no brackets. For example:

* `func_1("((()))")` returns `True`
* `func_1("({[]})")` returns `True`
* `func_1("({[}])")` returns `False`
* `func_1("(")` returns `False`
* `func_1(")")` returns `False`

In all these cases, the function produces the expected output, which suggests that it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in the expression are properly matched. If the expression has balanced brackets, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes cases where there are unmatched opening brackets, unmatched closing brackets, or a combination of both. The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with properly nested brackets. The return value provides a clear indication of whether the brackets in the input string are balanced, allowing the user to determine the validity of the bracket arrangement in the expression.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
