Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given string expression is balanced or not, specifically in terms of brackets. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.

Here is a breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty stack, which will store the opening brackets encountered in the expression.

2. **Dictionary for Brackets**: A dictionary `brackets` is defined to map each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket. This dictionary is used to check if a closing bracket matches the opening bracket at the top of the stack.

3. **Iterating Through the Expression**: The function iterates through each character in the given expression. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the stack.

4. **Checking Closing Brackets**: If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., a value in the `brackets` dictionary), the function checks two conditions:
   - If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`.
   - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element (an opening bracket) and checks if the corresponding closing bracket matches the current character. If they don't match, the function returns `False`.

5. **Final Check**: After iterating through the entire expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it's empty, it means all brackets were properly matched and closed, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- Empty strings
- Strings with only opening brackets
- Strings with only closing brackets
- Strings with matched brackets
- Strings with unmatched brackets
- Strings with nested brackets

Since the code correctly implements a stack-based approach to check for balanced brackets and handles all edge cases, it is considered correct.
