To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze its functionality in relation to the problem description.

The problem asks for a function that checks if a given expression is balanced or not, particularly in terms of parentheses, brackets, or braces. To be considered balanced, every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and these pairs must be properly nested.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, utilizes a stack to track the opening brackets encountered in the expression. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: It starts with an empty stack and a dictionary `brackets` that maps each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
2. **Traversal**: For each character `char` in the expression:
   - If `char` is an opening bracket (i.e., it's a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If `char` is a closing bracket (i.e., it's a value in the `brackets` dictionary), the function checks two conditions:
     - If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function immediately returns `False`.
     - If the top of the stack (which is popped) does not correspond to the current closing bracket (based on the `brackets` dictionary), the function returns `False`.
3. **Final Check**: After traversing the entire expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets, and the expression is balanced, so it returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the expression is not balanced, so it returns `False`.

Given the description of how `func_1` operates, it correctly implements a function to check if a given expression is balanced according to the problem description. The function handles the opening and closing brackets properly, ensuring that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that the pairs are correctly nested.

Therefore, considering the provided problem description and the implementation details of `func_1`, the conclusion is that the program correctly checks for balance in expressions containing parentheses, brackets, or braces.

Correctness: **True**
