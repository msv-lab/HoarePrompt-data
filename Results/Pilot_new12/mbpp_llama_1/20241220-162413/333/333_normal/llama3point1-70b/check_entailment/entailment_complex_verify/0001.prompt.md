You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given string expression is balanced or not, specifically in terms of brackets. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far and checks if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.

Here is a breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty stack, which will store the opening brackets encountered in the expression.

2. **Dictionary for Brackets**: A dictionary `brackets` is defined to map each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket. This dictionary is used to check if a closing bracket matches the opening bracket at the top of the stack.

3. **Iterating Through the Expression**: The function iterates through each character in the given expression. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the stack.

4. **Checking Closing Brackets**: If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., a value in the `brackets` dictionary), the function checks two conditions:
   - If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`.
   - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element (an opening bracket) and checks if the corresponding closing bracket matches the current character. If they don't match, the function returns `False`.

5. **Final Check**: After iterating through the entire expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it's empty, it means all brackets were properly matched and closed, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- Empty strings
- Strings with only opening brackets
- Strings with only closing brackets
- Strings with matched brackets
- Strings with unmatched brackets
- Strings with nested brackets

Since the code correctly implements a stack-based approach to check for balanced brackets and handles all edge cases, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string that has been fully traversed, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the last character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains any unmatched opening brackets from the `expression`.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets in the expression were properly matched) and False otherwise (indicating there are unmatched opening brackets in the expression).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in the expression are properly matched. If the expression has balanced brackets, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes cases where there are unmatched opening brackets, unmatched closing brackets, or a combination of both. The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with properly nested brackets. The return value provides a clear indication of whether the brackets in the input string are balanced, allowing the user to determine the validity of the bracket arrangement in the expression.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
