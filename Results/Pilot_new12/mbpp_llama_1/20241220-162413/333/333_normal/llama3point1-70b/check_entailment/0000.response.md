Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks if a given expression is balanced or not. An expression is considered balanced if every opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '[') has a corresponding closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']') and the pairs of brackets are properly nested.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The function initializes an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far.
2. It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
3. The function then iterates over each character in the input expression. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes the bracket onto the stack.
4. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the expression is not balanced.
5. After iterating over all characters in the expression, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly. The function correctly handles expressions with multiple types of brackets, nested brackets, and expressions with no brackets. For example:

* `func_1("((()))")` returns `True`
* `func_1("({[]})")` returns `True`
* `func_1("({[}])")` returns `False`
* `func_1("(")` returns `False`
* `func_1(")")` returns `False`

In all these cases, the function produces the expected output, which suggests that it is correct.
