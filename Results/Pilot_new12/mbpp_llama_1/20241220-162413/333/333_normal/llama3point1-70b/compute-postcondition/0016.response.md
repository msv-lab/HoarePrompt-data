Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 2 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If the second character of `expression` is a closing bracket and the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False if the second character is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the current character, or if the second character is not a closing bracket.***
