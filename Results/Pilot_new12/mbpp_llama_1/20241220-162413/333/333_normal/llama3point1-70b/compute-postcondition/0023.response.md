Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the third character in the `expression`. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` contains `char` as its new last element. If `char` is a closing bracket and the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character, the program returns False. If `char` is a closing bracket and the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the current character, the program continues execution without returning False, with the stack updated accordingly. If `char` is not a bracket, the program continues execution without returning False, with the stack updated accordingly based on the previous state of `char` and the stack.***
