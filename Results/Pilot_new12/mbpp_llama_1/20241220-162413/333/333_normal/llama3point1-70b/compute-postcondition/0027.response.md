Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `expression` containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and returns a boolean value indicating whether all brackets in the expression are properly matched. If the expression has balanced brackets, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This includes cases where there are unmatched opening brackets, unmatched closing brackets, or a combination of both. The function handles all potential edge cases, including empty strings, strings with only opening or closing brackets, and strings with properly nested brackets. The return value provides a clear indication of whether the brackets in the input string are balanced, allowing the user to determine the validity of the bracket arrangement in the expression.**
