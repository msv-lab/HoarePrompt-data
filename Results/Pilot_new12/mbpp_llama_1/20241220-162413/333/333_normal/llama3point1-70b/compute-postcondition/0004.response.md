The value of `char` is appended to the `stack`. The `stack` was initially empty, so now it contains the first character of the `expression`, which is an opening parenthesis, brace, or bracket. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is a list containing the first character of `expression`, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression` and is a key in the `brackets` dictionary.
