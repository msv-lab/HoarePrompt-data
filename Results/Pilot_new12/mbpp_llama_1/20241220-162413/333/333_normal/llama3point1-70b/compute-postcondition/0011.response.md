Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`. If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` is a list containing the value of `char`. If `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary but is a value in the `brackets` dictionary, and the stack is not empty, and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, then the state of the stack will be as if the last opening bracket has been removed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
