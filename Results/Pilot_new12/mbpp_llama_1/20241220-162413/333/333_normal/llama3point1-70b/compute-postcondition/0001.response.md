The code defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. This dictionary is used to keep track of the matching brackets.

The initial state is: `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list.

After executing the code, a new variable `brackets` is introduced, which is a dictionary containing the mapping of opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}.**
