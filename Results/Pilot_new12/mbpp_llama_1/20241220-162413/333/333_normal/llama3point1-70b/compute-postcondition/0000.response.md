The code initializes an empty list `stack`. The initial state mentions that `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, but this does not change with the given code. The code only affects the `stack` variable, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list**
