Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is a list, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`, `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary. If `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, the stack is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, i.e., `brackets[stack[-1]] == char` or equivalently `brackets[stack.pop()] == char` if the stack is popped. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle other cases.***
