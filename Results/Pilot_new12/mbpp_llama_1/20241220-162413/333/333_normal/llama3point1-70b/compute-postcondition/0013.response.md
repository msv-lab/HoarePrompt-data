The code appends the second character of `expression` to `stack`. Initially, `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, and `char` is the second character in the `expression`. 

The value of `char` is `expression[1]`. After executing the code, the last element in `stack` is `char`, which equals `expression[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is `expression[1]`, and `stack` contains `expression[1]` as its last element**
