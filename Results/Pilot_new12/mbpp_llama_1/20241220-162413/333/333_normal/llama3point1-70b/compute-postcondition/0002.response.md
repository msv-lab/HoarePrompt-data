According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is an empty list, and `brackets` is a dictionary. For the loop to be executed, the `expression` must have at least 1 character, and `char` is the first character in the `expression`. 

State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the first character in the `expression`**
