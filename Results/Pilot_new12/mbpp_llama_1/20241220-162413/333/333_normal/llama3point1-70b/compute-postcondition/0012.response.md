To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over each character `char` in the `expression` string.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `expression` has at least 1 character, `char` is the first character, and the state of `stack` depends on whether `char` is an opening bracket (key in `brackets` dictionary), a closing bracket (value in `brackets` dictionary), or neither.

For the loop to execute again, the next character in the `expression` string needs to be processed. This implies that `char` should move to the next position in the string. 

Since `expression` must have at least 1 character for the loop to start, for the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must have at least 2 characters. The character `char` should then be the second character in `expression`. The state of `brackets` remains unchanged as it is not altered by the loop iteration. The state of `stack` could change based on the previous character's type (opening or closing bracket), but for the next iteration, we consider the `stack` as it was left after the previous iteration's processing, now considering the next character `char` in the string.

State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces that must have at least 2 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`**
