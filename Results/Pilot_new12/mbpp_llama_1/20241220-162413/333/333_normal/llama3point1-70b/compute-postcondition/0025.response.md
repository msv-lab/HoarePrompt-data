The `return not stack` statement will return a boolean value indicating whether the `stack` is empty or not. Since `stack` contains any unmatched opening brackets from the `expression`, an empty `stack` means all brackets were matched, and a non-empty `stack` means there are unmatched opening brackets.

Given that `expression` is a string that has been fully traversed, `brackets` is a dictionary defining the matching brackets, `char` is the last character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains any unmatched opening brackets, the return statement essentially checks if all brackets in the `expression` were properly matched.

Output State: **The program returns True if the stack is empty (indicating all brackets in the expression were properly matched) and False otherwise (indicating there are unmatched opening brackets in the expression).**
