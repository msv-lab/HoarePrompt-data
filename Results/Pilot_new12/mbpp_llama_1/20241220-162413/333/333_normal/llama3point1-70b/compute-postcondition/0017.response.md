Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 2 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` contains `expression[1]` as its last element. If `char` is a closing bracket, the program returns False if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character; otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False.***
