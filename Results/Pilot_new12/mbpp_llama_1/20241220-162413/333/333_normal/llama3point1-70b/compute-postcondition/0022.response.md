Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the third character in the `expression`. If `char` is a closing bracket and the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character, the program returns False. If `char` is not a closing bracket, the program continues execution without returning False, with the stack updated accordingly based on the previous state of `char` and the stack.***
