The code appends `char` to the `stack`. If `char` is an opening bracket, it is added to the `stack`. If `char` is a closing bracket, the previous state already handled the case where the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current character.

Given that `char` is the third character in the `expression`, `stack` now contains `expression[2]` as its new last element if `char` is an opening bracket. In any case, `char` is appended to the `stack`. The value of `expression`, `brackets`, and the condition that `char` is the third character in the `expression` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the third character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains all its previous elements and `char` as its new last element.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces with at least 3 characters, `brackets` is a dictionary {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}, `char` is the third character in the `expression`, and `stack` contains all its previous elements and `char` as its new last element**
