Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In camel case, the first word is supposed to be in lower case, and the rest of the words are capitalized. However, the given program capitalizes all the words. 

For example, if the input is 'hello_world', the program will return 'HelloWorld', but the correct camel case string should be 'helloWorld'. 

To fix this, the program should capitalize all the words except the first one. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```

This version of the function will correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string.
