Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string starts with an underscore. In camel case, the first word should not be capitalized if the original string started with an underscore. The code provided capitalizes the first word even if the original string started with an underscore.

For example, if the input string is `_hello_world`, the function should return `helloWorld` but it will return `HelloWorld`. 

Another case the function does not handle correctly is when the input string has consecutive underscores. In this case, the function should not insert extra words. 

However, the main issue of this function is that it does not correctly convert the string from snake case to camel case. In camel case, the first word is typically lowercase, not uppercase. So, if the input string is `hello_world`, the function should return `helloWorld` but it will return `HelloWorld`. 

Here is an example of how the function could be correctly implemented:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    # Filter out empty strings that can be created if the input string starts or ends with underscores
    # or if the input string has consecutive underscores
    components = [x for x in components if x]
    if components:
        return components[0].lower() + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
    else:
        return ''
```

This function correctly handles the cases when the input string starts with an underscore, has consecutive underscores, or is an empty string, and it correctly converts the string from snake case to camel case.
