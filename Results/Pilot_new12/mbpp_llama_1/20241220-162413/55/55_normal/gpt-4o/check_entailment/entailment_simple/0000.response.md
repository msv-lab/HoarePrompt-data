Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In camel case, the first word should be in lowercase and subsequent words should start with an uppercase letter.

The given function, `func_1`, capitalizes the first word as well as subsequent words. This means it converts the input string to title case (or Pascal case), not camel case. 

For example, if the input string is 'python_program', the function will return 'PythonProgram', but according to the problem description, it should return 'pythonProgram'.

To fix this, the function should only capitalize the words after the first word. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components[1:])
```

This corrected function first splits the input string into words, then concatenates the first word (in lowercase) with the capitalized subsequent words, resulting in a camel case string.
