Correctness: **False** 

The given program does not entirely follow the problem description. The problem asks to convert a snake case string to camel case string, which means the first word should be in lowercase and the rest of the words should start with an uppercase letter. However, the given program converts the entire string to Pascal case, where every word starts with an uppercase letter.

For example, if the input string is 'hello_world', the expected output in camel case should be 'helloWorld', but the program returns 'HelloWorld'. 

To achieve the desired output, the program should be modified to capitalize only the words after the first one. This can be done by using the `capitalize()` function only for the words at index 1 and above in the list of words, while keeping the first word in lowercase.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components[1:])
```
This corrected code will return the correct camel case string according to the problem description.
