Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string for all potential cases. According to the problem description, the function should convert a snake case string to a camel case string, where the first character of the resulting string should be in lower case, and the first character of each subsequent word should be in upper case.

The issue with the given program is that it capitalizes the first character of the first word as well, which is not in line with the camel case convention. For example, if the input is 'hello_world', the program will return 'HelloWorld', whereas the correct camel case string should be 'helloWorld'.

Here's a correct implementation of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```

This implementation ensures that the first character of the resulting string is in lower case, and the first character of each subsequent word is in upper case, as per the camel case convention.
