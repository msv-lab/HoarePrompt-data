#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where words are separated by underscores.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string where each word, originally separated by underscores in `snake_str`, now starts with an uppercase letter, and the rest of the letters are in lowercase.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `snake_str` containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, and returns a string where each word, originally separated by underscores in `snake_str`, now starts with an uppercase letter, and the rest of the letters are in lowercase. This includes handling single-word inputs (with no underscores), empty strings, and strings with multiple consecutive underscores, where each resulting word will still start with an uppercase letter. The function considers the first character of each word as the character after an underscore or at the start of the string, capitalizing it and lowercasing the rest, thus maintaining the original word boundaries but with a capitalized first letter for each word. The function also properly handles edge cases such as an input string consisting of only underscores, an empty string, or strings with leading or trailing underscores, correctly returning a string with the first letter of each word capitalized and the rest in lowercase, even if that means returning an empty string for the case of an input string containing no letters.
