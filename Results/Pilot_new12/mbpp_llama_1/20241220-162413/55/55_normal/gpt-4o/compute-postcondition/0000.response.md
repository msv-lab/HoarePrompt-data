To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is that `snake_str` is a string containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where words are separated by underscores.

The code `components = snake_str.split('_')` splits the string `snake_str` into a list of words using the underscore as a delimiter.

Since `snake_str` contains lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, and words are separated by underscores, the `split('_')` method will correctly separate the string into individual words.

For example, if `snake_str` is `"hello_world_123"`, the `components` list will be `['hello', 'world', '123']`.

Given this, the output state will be: `snake_str` is a string containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where words are separated by underscores, and `components` is a list of strings where each string represents a word from `snake_str` separated by underscores.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string containing lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where words are separated by underscores, and `components` is a list of strings where each string is a substring of `snake_str` separated by underscores**.
