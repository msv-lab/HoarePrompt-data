The function accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str` and returns a camel case string where the first letter of each word (except the first word) is capitalized. The function splits the input string into words based on underscores, capitalizes the first letter of each word (except possibly the first word), and joins them together. If the input string is empty or only contains underscores, the function will return an empty string or a string with multiple consecutive capital letters respectively. The function does not handle cases where the input string contains non-alphanumeric characters or non-underscore word separators, and may produce unexpected results in such cases. The function also does not preserve the original case of the first word, always forcing it to start with a lowercase letter if the input string starts with a lowercase letter.
