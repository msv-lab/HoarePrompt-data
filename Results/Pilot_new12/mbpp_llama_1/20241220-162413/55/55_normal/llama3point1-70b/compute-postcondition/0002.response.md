The `camel_case_str` is a string that is created by joining the capitalized words from the `snake_case_str` that were split by '_'. Since `snake_case_str` contains alphanumeric characters and underscores, the `words` list will contain strings that are the parts of `snake_case_str` separated by these underscores. When these words are capitalized and joined together, they form `camel_case_str`. 

Given this information, the program returns `camel_case_str`, which is a string where the first letter of each word (except possibly the first word, depending on the original `snake_case_str`) is capitalized, and there are no underscores.

Output State: **The program returns a camel case string where the first letter of each word (except possibly the first word) is capitalized, formed from 'snake_case_str' split by '_' and then capitalized.**
