The code splits the string `snake_case_str` into a list of words using the underscore as a separator. 

The string `snake_case_str` is a string containing alphanumeric characters and underscores, where each word is separated by an underscore. 

After the split operation, `words` will be a list of strings where each string represents a word from the original `snake_case_str`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing alphanumeric characters and underscores, where each word is separated by an underscore, `words` is a list of strings equal to `snake_case_str` split by '_'**
