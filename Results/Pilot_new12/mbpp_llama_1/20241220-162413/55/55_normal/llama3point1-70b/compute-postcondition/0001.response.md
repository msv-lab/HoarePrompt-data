To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given code snippet does.

The code `camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)` takes each word in the `words` list, capitalizes it (making the first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase), and then joins these words together without any separators.

Given the initial state:
- `snake_case_str` is a string containing alphanumeric characters and underscores, where each word is separated by an underscore.
- `words` is a list of strings equal to `snake_case_str` split by '_'.

The `words` list is derived from `snake_case_str` by splitting it at the underscores. For example, if `snake_case_str` is `"hello_world_example"`, then `words` would be `["hello", "world", "example"]`.

After applying the `capitalize()` method to each word in `words`, we get `["Hello", "World", "Example"]`.

Then, joining these capitalized words together without any separators gives us the string `"HelloWorldExample"`.

Therefore, the variable `camel_case_str` is assigned this joined string.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. `snake_case_str` remains the original string with underscores, and `words` remains the list of strings split from `snake_case_str`.

So, `snake_case_str` is still a string containing alphanumeric characters and underscores, `words` is still a list of strings equal to `snake_case_str` split by '_', and `camel_case_str` becomes a string where each word from `snake_case_str` is capitalized and joined together without separators.

Given that `words` is a list of strings equal to `snake_case_str` split by '_', and `camel_case_str` is derived from `words` by capitalizing each word and joining them together, we can say that `camel_case_str` is equal to `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in snake_case_str.split('_'))`.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing alphanumeric characters and underscores, `words` is a list of strings equal to `snake_case_str` split by '_', `camel_case_str` is `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in snake_case_str.split('_'))`.**
