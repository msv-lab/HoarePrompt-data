Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case. According to the problem description, the function should capitalize the first letter of each word (except the first word). However, the provided code capitalizes the first letter of every word, including the first word. 

For example, if the input string is "hello_world", the expected output should be "helloWorld", but the code will return "HelloWorld". This shows that the code does not handle the case where the first word should not be capitalized. 

To fix this, the code should be modified to only capitalize the first letter of each word, except the first word. Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
