Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program capitalizes the first word as well, whereas the problem description specifies that the first letter of each word (except possibly the first word) should be capitalized. 

According to the problem description, the function should return a camel case string where the first letter of each word (except possibly the first word) is capitalized. However, in the provided code, the line `camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)` capitalizes the first letter of each word, including the first word. 

For example, if the input string is "hello_world", the function should return "helloWorld", but the provided code will return "HelloWorld". To fix this, the code should only capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, which can be achieved by using the following code:
```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
    return camel_case_str
```
This revised code meets the requirements of the problem description, as it only capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first word.
