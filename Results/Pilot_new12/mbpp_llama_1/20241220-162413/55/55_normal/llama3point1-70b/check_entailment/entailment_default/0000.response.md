Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. The problem description requires that only the first letter of each word (except the first word) should be capitalized, but the code capitalizes the first letter of every word. 

For example, if the input string is "hello_world", the output should be "helloWorld", but the code will return "HelloWorld". This is because the code uses the `capitalize()` method on every word, which capitalizes the first letter and makes the rest of the letters lowercase.

Additionally, the output hints mention that the function does not preserve the original case of the first word, always forcing it to start with a lowercase letter if the input string starts with a lowercase letter. This is also incorrect, as the first word in a camel case string should have the same case as the first word in the original snake case string. 

To fix this, the code should only capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word, and preserve the original case of the first word. 

A corrected version of the code could be:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
