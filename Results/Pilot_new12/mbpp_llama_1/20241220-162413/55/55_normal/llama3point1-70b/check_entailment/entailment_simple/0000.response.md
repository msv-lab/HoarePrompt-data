Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all cases. The issue lies in the fact that the problem description requires the first word in the camel case string to be in lowercase (unless specified otherwise), but the provided program capitalizes every word, including the first one.

In the line `camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)`, the `capitalize()` method is applied to every word, which converts the first character of each word to uppercase and makes all other characters in the word lowercase. However, in camel case, the first word should remain in lowercase.

To fix this issue, the program should only capitalize the words except the first one. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
    return camel_case_str
```

In this corrected code, the first word (`words[0]`) is left as it is, and the `capitalize()` method is applied only to the remaining words (`words[1:]`). This way, the resulting string will be in camel case as required by the problem description.
