Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case. The issue arises when the program capitalizes the first word of the string, which should remain in lowercase in camel case. 

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the program will return "HelloWorld", but the correct output should be "helloWorld". 

To fix this, the program should only capitalize the words after the first word. Here's how you could modify the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
