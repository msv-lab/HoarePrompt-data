Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list, leaving the original list unchanged.

The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` effectively filters out the odd numbers and returns a new list with only the even numbers. The condition `num % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even (i.e., if it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various input scenarios, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, and lists with only odd numbers.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the program does not need to handle edge cases such as non-list inputs or empty lists. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
