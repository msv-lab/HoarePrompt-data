Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly filters a list of integers to include only the even numbers, returning this new list while leaving the original list unchanged. The code uses a list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` to create a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. This approach handles edge cases where the input list may be empty, contain only odd numbers, or contain a mix of even and odd numbers, correctly returning an empty list, a list of even numbers, or a list of all numbers respectively. The function does not modify the original list, preserving its contents. The provided unit tests `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]` and `assert func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]` confirm that the function behaves as expected. The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function correctly filters the list to include only the even numbers. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or an empty list. Overall, the code is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case.
