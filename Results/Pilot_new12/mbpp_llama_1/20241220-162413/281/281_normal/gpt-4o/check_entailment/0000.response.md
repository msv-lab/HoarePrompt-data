Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly identify and return all even numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, the number is even and is included in the output list.

The function handles various test cases correctly, including lists containing both even and odd numbers, lists containing only even numbers, and lists containing only odd numbers. The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or a list containing a single element.

For example, the function correctly identifies the even numbers in the following lists:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `[2, 4]`
- `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`
- `[8, 12, 15, 19]` returns `[8, 12]`

In addition to these specific test cases, the function's logic and implementation suggest that it should work correctly for all possible input lists. Since no potential cases have been found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
