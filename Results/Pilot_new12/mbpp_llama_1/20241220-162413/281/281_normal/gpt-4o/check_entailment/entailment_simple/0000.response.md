Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of integers as input and return a list of even numbers from the original list. 

The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number `num`, it checks if the remainder of `num` divided by 2 is equal to 0 using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, the number is even and is included in the output list. If the condition is false, the number is odd and is excluded from the output list.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]` and `assert func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]`, demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input lists.

Since the program correctly identifies and returns the even numbers from the input list, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
