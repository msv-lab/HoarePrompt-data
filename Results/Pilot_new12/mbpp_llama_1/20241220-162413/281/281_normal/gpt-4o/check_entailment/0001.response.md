Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is correct and meets the problem description. It correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the number is even, it is included in the output list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, as they cover various scenarios, including lists with both even and odd numbers, and lists with only even or only odd numbers. The function handles all these cases correctly and returns the expected output.

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected, and the provided unit tests cover a range of scenarios, indicating that the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
