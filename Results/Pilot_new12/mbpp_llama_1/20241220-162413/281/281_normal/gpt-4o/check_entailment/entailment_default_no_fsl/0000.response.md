Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers, leaving only the even numbers in the new list.

The function handles edge cases correctly, including empty lists, lists containing only odd numbers, and lists containing a mix of even and odd numbers. The function does not modify the original list, preserving its contents.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. The function correctly returns a list of even numbers for each test case, and it does not modify the original list.

The output hints agree with the code's behavior, describing the function's ability to filter out odd numbers and return a new list containing only the even numbers, without modifying the original list.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or contains non-integer values. Under these assumptions, the function behaves correctly for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is True.
