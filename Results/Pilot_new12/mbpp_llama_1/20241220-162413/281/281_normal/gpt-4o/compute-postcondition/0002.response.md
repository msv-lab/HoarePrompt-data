Functionality: **The function filters a list of integers to include only the even numbers, returning this new list while leaving the original list unchanged. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The function handles edge cases where the input list may be empty, contain only odd numbers, or contain a mix of even and odd numbers, correctly returning an empty list, a list of even numbers, or a list of all numbers respectively. It does not modify the original list, preserving its contents.**
