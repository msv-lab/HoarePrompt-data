Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out odd integers by checking if each number is divisible by 2 with no remainder (`num % 2 == 0`). This approach correctly identifies even numbers and excludes odd numbers from the output list. The function handles various edge cases, including an empty input list, a list containing only odd or only even integers, or a mix of both, and returns the expected results. Additionally, the function does not modify the original list and returns an empty list if there are no even integers in the input. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function's lack of error checking for non-integer values or invalid input types does not affect its correctness for the specified problem description. Therefore, the code meets the requirements and produces the correct output for every potential case.
