Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of even integers from the original list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number `num`, it checks if the number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This is a standard way to check if a number is even in Python.
3. If the number is even, it is included in the output list.
4. The function returns the list of even numbers, which is what the problem description requires.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case (i.e., it correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from the input list), it is considered correct. 

Example:

Input: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
Output: `[2, 4, 6]`
As expected, the function returns a list of even numbers from the original list. 

This example demonstrates that the program works as intended, and it will continue to work correctly for any valid input list of integers.
