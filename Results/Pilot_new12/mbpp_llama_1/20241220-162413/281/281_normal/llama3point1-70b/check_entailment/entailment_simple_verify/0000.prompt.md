You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list `numbers`. This is done by checking each number in the list to see if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder (`num % 2 == 0`), which is the definition of an even number.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- It correctly identifies even numbers: If a number is even, it will be included in the output list.
- It correctly excludes odd numbers: If a number is odd, it will not be included in the output list.
- It handles empty lists: If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is the correct result.
- It handles lists containing non-integer values: If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will still work, but it may raise an error or produce unexpected results for non-integer values. However, based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input list only contains numbers (integers or floats).
- It handles lists containing negative numbers: If the input list contains negative numbers, the function will still work correctly, as the modulo operator `%` in Python works with negative numbers.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the original 'numbers' list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
