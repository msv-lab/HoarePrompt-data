You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the remainder of the division is zero, the number is even and is included in the output list.

This program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It works correctly for lists containing only even numbers, only odd numbers, or a mix of both, as well as for empty lists. It also correctly identifies even numbers in the list, regardless of their position or the size of the list.

For example, given the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function will correctly return `[2, 4, 6]`. Given an empty list `[]`, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]`. Given a list containing only odd numbers, such as `[1, 3, 5]`, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]`. 

The program does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling, and it correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the original 'numbers' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the odd integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The original list remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases where the input list is empty, contains only odd or only even integers, or a mix of both. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will throw an error when attempting to calculate the modulus of a non-integer value. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-integer values in the input list, and it does not modify the original list in any way. The returned list will be empty if the original list contains no even integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
