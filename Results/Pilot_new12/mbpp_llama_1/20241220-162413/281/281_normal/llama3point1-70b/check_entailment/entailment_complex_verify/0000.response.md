The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the program's correctness, considering various potential cases such as handling even numbers, odd numbers, empty lists, non-integer values, and negative numbers. 

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the annotations support the original assessment. The annotations describe the program's behavior accurately, stating that it filters out odd integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list, without modifying the original list.

Given that we assume the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing only even or only odd integers, and it does not modify the original list.

The only potential issue mentioned in both the original assessment and the annotated code is the handling of non-integer values. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input list only contains numbers (integers or floats), and we are also assuming that the input will be valid. Therefore, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program's behavior is as expected, and it correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers.

Final: **True**
