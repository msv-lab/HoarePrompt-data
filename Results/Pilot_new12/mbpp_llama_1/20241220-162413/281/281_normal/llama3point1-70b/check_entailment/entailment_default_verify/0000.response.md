The original assessment states that the program is correct, with a correctness value of **True**. Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is indeed accurate.

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This is achieved through the use of list comprehension and the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`), which correctly identifies even numbers.

The output hints support the original assessment by stating that the function filters out odd integers, handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing only odd or even integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The output hints also mention that the function does not modify the original list, which aligns with the behavior of the provided code.

One potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function will throw an error if the input list contains non-integer values. However, the problem description assumes that the input list only contains numbers (integers or floats), and it is stated that we assume the user will always provide a valid input. Therefore, this potential issue does not affect the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description.

Based on the information available, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
