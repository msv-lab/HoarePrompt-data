Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The provided annotated program does exactly that by using a list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers and return a new list containing only the even numbers.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem description:
- It takes a list of integers as input.
- It filters out the odd integers.
- It returns a new list containing only the even integers.
- It handles edge cases where the input list is empty, contains only odd or only even integers, or a mix of both.

The list comprehension `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` is the key to the program's functionality. It iterates over each number in the input list, checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., if the number is even), and if so, includes it in the new list.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program's lack of error checking or handling for non-integer values or empty lists does not affect its correctness in this context.
