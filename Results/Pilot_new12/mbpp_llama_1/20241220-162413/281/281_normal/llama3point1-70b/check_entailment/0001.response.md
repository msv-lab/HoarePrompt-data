Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the remainder of the division is zero, the number is even and is included in the output list.

This program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It works correctly for lists containing only even numbers, only odd numbers, or a mix of both, as well as for empty lists. It also correctly identifies even numbers in the list, regardless of their position or the size of the list.

For example, given the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function will correctly return `[2, 4, 6]`. Given an empty list `[]`, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]`. Given a list containing only odd numbers, such as `[1, 3, 5]`, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]`. 

The program does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling, and it correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
