The original assessment claims that the provided Python program is correct according to the problem description, which is to write a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. 

Upon reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the function `func_1` indeed iterates over each number in the input list `numbers` and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the remainder of the division is zero, the number is even and is included in the output list.

The annotated version of the code supports this claim, stating that the program returns a list of even integers from the original `numbers` list. This annotation aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem description.

Given that the program accurately implements the problem description, handles potential cases (as described in the original assessment), and the annotations confirm the expected behavior, there is no reason to doubt the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **True**
