Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list `numbers`. This is done by checking each number in the list to see if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder (`num % 2 == 0`), which is the definition of an even number.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- It correctly identifies even numbers: If a number is even, it will be included in the output list.
- It correctly excludes odd numbers: If a number is odd, it will not be included in the output list.
- It handles empty lists: If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is the correct result.
- It handles lists containing non-integer values: If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will still work, but it may raise an error or produce unexpected results for non-integer values. However, based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input list only contains numbers (integers or floats).
- It handles lists containing negative numbers: If the input list contains negative numbers, the function will still work correctly, as the modulo operator `%` in Python works with negative numbers.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it a correct solution.
