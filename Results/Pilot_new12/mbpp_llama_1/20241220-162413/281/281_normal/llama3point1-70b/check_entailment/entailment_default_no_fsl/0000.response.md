Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements stated in the problem description. It successfully filters a list of numbers to return only the even integers, leaving the original list unchanged. The function handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists containing only odd or only even integers, and lists with a mix of both. Additionally, the function's behavior is consistent with the output hints, which describe its functionality and edge case handling.

The assumption that the input will always be a list of integers allows us to focus on the function's primary task. Given this constraint, the function is implemented correctly, using a list comprehension to filter out odd integers based on the modulus operator (`num % 2 == 0`).

The output hints and problem description do not reveal any scenarios where the function fails to meet its intended purpose, provided the input is a non-empty list of integers. Therefore, under the given assumptions and constraints, the function behaves as expected for every potential case.
