The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the odd integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The original list remains unchanged. The function handles edge cases where the input list is empty, contains only odd or only even integers, or a mix of both. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will throw an error when attempting to calculate the modulus of a non-integer value. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-integer values in the input list, and it does not modify the original list in any way. The returned list will be empty if the original list contains no even integers.
