The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` that can contain any type of elements and returns the count of integers in `lst`. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and counts integers correctly regardless of their position or frequency within the list. The function does not modify the original list `lst` and only returns the integer count. It implicitly handles edge cases such as lists containing only integers, lists containing no integers, and lists containing a mix of integers and other data types, as well as handling empty lists by returning 0, since the sum of an empty iterable is 0.
