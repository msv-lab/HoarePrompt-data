Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It utilizes a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`, checking if `x` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. This approach correctly handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and counts integers regardless of their position or frequency within the list.

The function implicitly handles various edge cases, such as lists containing only integers, lists containing no integers, and lists containing a mix of integers and other data types. For empty lists, it correctly returns 0, as the sum of an empty iterable is 0.

Given that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., a list), the function's design is robust and accurate for its intended purpose. It does not modify the original list and only returns the count of integers, adhering to the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the code works as expected for every potential case, making it correct.
