Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the problem description, which requires it to return the number of integer elements in a given list. 

Here's why it works:

- The function uses a generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `lst`.
- For each element, `isinstance(x, int)` checks if the element is an integer. This function returns `True` if the element is an integer and `False` otherwise.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these boolean values. In Python, `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 when used in arithmetic operations. Therefore, `sum` effectively counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for lists containing any type of elements, including integers, floats, strings, and other types, because `isinstance(x, int)` accurately identifies integer elements.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., the function will always receive a list as input), this function does exactly what the problem description asks for, making it correct.
