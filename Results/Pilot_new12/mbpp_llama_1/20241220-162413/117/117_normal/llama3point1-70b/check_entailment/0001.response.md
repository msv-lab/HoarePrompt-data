Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`. This returns `True` if the element is an integer and `False` otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up these boolean values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: The function correctly returns 0 for an empty list.
* Lists with only integers: The function correctly counts the number of integers in the list.
* Lists with non-integer elements: The function correctly ignores non-integer elements and counts only the integers.
* Lists with mixed types: The function correctly counts the integers and ignores other types.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
