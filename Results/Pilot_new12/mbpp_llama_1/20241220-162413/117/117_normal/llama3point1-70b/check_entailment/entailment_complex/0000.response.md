The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to count the number of integer elements in a given list. This directly aligns with the problem description provided. 

Here's why `func_1` meets the requirements:

1. **Input Flexibility**: The function accepts a list `lst` that can contain any type of elements, which adheres to the problem's requirement of handling lists with any combination of data types.

2. **Correct Counting**: The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`, which returns `True` (equivalent to 1) if the element is an integer and `False` (equivalent to 0) otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up these boolean values, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - **Empty Lists**: The function correctly handles empty lists by returning 0, as the sum of an empty iterable is 0.
   - **Lists with Only Integers**: It correctly counts all elements as integers.
   - **Lists with No Integers**: It returns 0, as expected.
   - **Lists with Mixed Data Types**: It accurately counts only the integers among other data types.

4. **Non-Modification of Input**: The function does not modify the original list `lst`; it only returns the count of integers, adhering to the problem's requirement.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list), the function does not need to include error checking for invalid inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the function's implementation, it is clear that `func_1` meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
