Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in the list. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance` function. The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values (which are treated as 1) and `False` values (which are treated as 0) to give the total count of integer elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles:

* Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns 0
* Lists with only integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3
* Lists with only non-integers: `func_1([1.5, 'a', None])` returns 0
* Lists with a mix of integers and non-integers: `func_1([1, 2, 'a', 3.5, None, 4])` returns 3

The function is also concise and efficient, making it a correct solution to the problem.
