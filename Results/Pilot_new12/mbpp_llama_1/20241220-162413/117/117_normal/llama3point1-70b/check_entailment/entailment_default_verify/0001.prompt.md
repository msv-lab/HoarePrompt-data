You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((isinstance(x, int) for x in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`. This returns `True` if the element is an integer and `False` otherwise. The `sum` function then adds up these boolean values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: The function correctly returns 0 for an empty list.
* Lists with only integers: The function correctly counts the number of integers in the list.
* Lists with non-integer elements: The function correctly ignores non-integer elements and counts only the integers.
* Lists with mixed types: The function correctly counts the integers and ignores other types.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` that can contain any type of elements and returns the count of integers in `lst`. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and counts integers correctly regardless of their position or frequency within the list. The function does not modify the original list `lst` and only returns the integer count. It implicitly handles edge cases such as lists containing only integers, lists containing no integers, and lists containing a mix of integers and other data types, as well as handling empty lists by returning 0, since the sum of an empty iterable is 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
