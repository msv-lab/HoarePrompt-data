The code `return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` iterates over each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`. This returns `True` if `x` is an integer and `False` otherwise. In Python, `True` is treated as 1 and `False` is treated as 0 when used in a numeric context like `sum`. Therefore, the code effectively counts the number of integers in the list `lst`.

Output State: **The program returns the number of integers in the list `lst`.**
