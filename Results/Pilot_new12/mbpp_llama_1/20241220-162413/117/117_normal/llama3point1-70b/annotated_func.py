#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that can contain any type of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the number of integers in the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` that can contain any type of elements and returns the count of integers in `lst`. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and counts integers correctly regardless of their position or frequency within the list. The function does not modify the original list `lst` and only returns the integer count. It implicitly handles edge cases such as lists containing only integers, lists containing no integers, and lists containing a mix of integers and other data types, as well as handling empty lists by returning 0, since the sum of an empty iterable is 0.
