Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

2. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. It checks if each element is an instance of the `int` type using `isinstance(x, int)`, and only counts those that are.

3. The function handles lists with any combination of data types, including integers, floats, strings, and other types, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

4. The function returns 0 if the list is empty or if it contains no integers, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

5. The function does not modify the original list, as required by the problem description.

6. The count is inclusive of all integer elements, regardless of their value (positive, negative, or zero), which meets the problem description's requirements.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it correct for its intended purpose.
