Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly returns the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the elements in the list that are instances of the `int` type, as determined by the `isinstance` function.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Lists with a mix of integers, floats, and strings
- Lists containing only integers
- Lists containing a combination of integers and floats

The use of `isinstance(x, int)` ensures that only integer elements are counted, excluding floats and other types of elements.

All the provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios. Since the function is designed to count integers in a list and it does so correctly for all potential cases that have been considered, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
