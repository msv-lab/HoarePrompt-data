Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly returns the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list and count the elements that are instances of the `int` type. This approach handles lists containing a mix of data types, including integers, floats, and strings, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

The `isinstance(x, int)` check ensures that only elements that are actual integers are counted, excluding floats and other types. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the number of integer elements.

The function works correctly for various input scenarios, including lists with only integers, lists with a mix of integers and other types, and lists where the integers are not consecutive. Given the provided unit tests and understanding of the function's logic, it appears that `func_1` is correctly implemented to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
