Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and check if each element is an instance of the `int` type. The `sum` function then adds up the counts of integer elements.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of what the function does. The function handles lists with any combination of data types, returns 0 if the list is empty or contains no integers, and counts all integer elements regardless of their value.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns 2, which is correct because there are two integer elements in the list. Similarly, `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3, and `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns 2.

Since the code handles all potential cases and the output hints agree with the code, I conclude that the code is correct.
