You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly returns the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list and count the elements that are instances of the `int` type. This approach handles lists containing a mix of data types, including integers, floats, and strings, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

The `isinstance(x, int)` check ensures that only elements that are actual integers are counted, excluding floats and other types. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the number of integer elements.

The function works correctly for various input scenarios, including lists with only integers, lists with a mix of integers and other types, and lists where the integers are not consecutive. Given the provided unit tests and understanding of the function's logic, it appears that `func_1` is correctly implemented to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. It does not modify the original list and only considers elements that are instances of the `int` type, ignoring all other types of elements. The function handles lists with any combination of data types and returns 0 if the list is empty or if it contains no integers. The count is inclusive of all integer elements, regardless of their value (positive, negative, or zero). After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the program returns the integer count as a result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
