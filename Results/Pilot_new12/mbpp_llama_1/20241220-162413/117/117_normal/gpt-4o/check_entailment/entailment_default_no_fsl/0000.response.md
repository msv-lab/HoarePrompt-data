Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately implements the behavior described in the problem statement. It iterates through each element in the input list `lst` and uses the `isinstance(x, int)` function to check if an element is an instance of the `int` type. The `sum` function then adds up the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, effectively counting the number of integers in the list.

The code handles various cases correctly, including:

1. Lists containing a mix of integers and non-integer values (e.g., strings, floats).
2. Lists containing only integers.
3. Lists containing no integers.
4. Empty lists.

The function does not modify the original list and returns the correct count of integers in all these cases. The output hints provided also align with the code's functionality, and no edge cases or scenarios were found where the code would behave incorrectly according to the problem description.

Overall, the code is well-structured, readable, and effectively solves the problem as stated.
