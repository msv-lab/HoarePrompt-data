Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers in the list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list and counts the elements that are instances of `int` using the `isinstance(x, int)` condition.

The program handles lists with a mix of integer and non-integer elements correctly, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. For example, in the test `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`, the function correctly returns `2` because there are two integer elements (`1` and `2`) in the list.

The program also handles lists with only integer elements or only non-integer elements correctly, as demonstrated by the tests `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3` and `assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2`.

Overall, the program accurately implements the specified functionality, making it correct according to the problem description.
