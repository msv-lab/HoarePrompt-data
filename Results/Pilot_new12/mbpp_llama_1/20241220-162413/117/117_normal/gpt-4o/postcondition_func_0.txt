The function accepts a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integers present in the list. It does not modify the original list and only considers elements that are instances of the `int` type, ignoring all other types of elements. The function handles lists with any combination of data types and returns 0 if the list is empty or if it contains no integers. The count is inclusive of all integer elements, regardless of their value (positive, negative, or zero). After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the program returns the integer count as a result.
