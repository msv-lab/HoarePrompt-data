Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd and `False` if it is even. The parity of a number is determined by its remainder when divided by 2, and the code correctly implements this logic using the modulo operator (`n % 2!= 0`).

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input number is odd or even. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness, as it correctly identifies odd numbers (e.g., `func_1(7) == True`) and even numbers (e.g., `func_1(12) == False` and `func_1(10) == False`).

Given the assumption that the input will be a valid integer, the code handles all potential cases correctly, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would produce incorrect results for any valid input. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
