Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is even.

The given unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for both odd and even numbers:

- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because 12 is an even number.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct because 7 is an odd number.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct because 10 is an even number.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the parity of a number. The use of the modulus operator to check for even or odd is a standard and efficient approach in programming.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the provided problem description and unit tests, and no counterexamples could be found that would cause the function to fail, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
