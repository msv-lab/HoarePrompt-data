Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The original assessment correctly states that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2, which is a correct approach to determine the parity of a number.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, as it states that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This is consistent with the problem description and the original assessment.

Furthermore, the unit tests provided validate the correctness of the function for different inputs, including both even and odd numbers. This suggests that the function behaves as expected and correctly handles all potential cases.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and based on the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
