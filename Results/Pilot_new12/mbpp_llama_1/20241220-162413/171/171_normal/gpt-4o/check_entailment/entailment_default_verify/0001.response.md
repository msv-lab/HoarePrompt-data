The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether a given integer `n` is odd by using the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the code, indicating that it returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers.

The code and the output hints align perfectly with the problem description, which requires a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs.

There is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect. The output hints do not provide any new information that would indicate the code is incorrect, and the code itself remains unchanged. Therefore, based on the problem description, the output hints, and the code, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **True**
