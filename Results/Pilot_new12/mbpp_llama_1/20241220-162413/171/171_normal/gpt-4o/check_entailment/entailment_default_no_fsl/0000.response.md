Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This is achieved by using the modulo operator (`%`), which returns the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the number is odd, and the function returns `True`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for both even and odd inputs. The function works as expected for every potential case, as it correctly categorizes integers into odd and even based on their parity. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, providing examples of its correct behavior.

In this case, since we assume that the input will always be a valid integer, the function does not need to handle edge cases such as non-integer inputs or empty inputs. Therefore, the code meets the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
