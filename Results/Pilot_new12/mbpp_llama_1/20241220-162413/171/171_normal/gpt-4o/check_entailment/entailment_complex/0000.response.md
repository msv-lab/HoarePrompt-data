The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether a given number `n` is odd or even. It uses the modulo operator `%`, which returns the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is even.

Given the problem description, which asks to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, the provided function `func_1(n)` meets this requirement perfectly. It correctly identifies odd numbers by checking if the remainder of the division by 2 is not 0, which is a standard and efficient way to check for odd parity in integers.

The provided assertions (`assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, `assert func_1(10) == False`) further demonstrate the function's correctness by testing it with both odd and even numbers and verifying that it returns the expected results.

Therefore, since the function does exactly what the problem description asks for, which is to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd, and it does so correctly for all potential cases (odd and even numbers), the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
