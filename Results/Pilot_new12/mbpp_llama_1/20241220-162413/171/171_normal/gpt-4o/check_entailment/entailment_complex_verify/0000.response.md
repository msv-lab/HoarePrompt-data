The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon reviewing the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, it appears to be accurate. 

The problem description asks for a Python function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided function `func_1(n)` uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2, which is a standard approach to check for odd or even numbers. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd, and `False` otherwise.

The unit tests (`assert` statements) provided demonstrate the function's correctness for both odd and even numbers:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because 12 is an even number.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True` because 7 is an odd number.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False` because 10 is an even number.

The annotated version of the code further clarifies the function's behavior, stating that the program returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, effectively categorizing any integer input into one of these two states based on its parity. This aligns with the problem description and the provided unit tests.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic for determining the parity of a number and the unit tests confirm its correctness for both odd and even inputs, and considering the assumptions that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
