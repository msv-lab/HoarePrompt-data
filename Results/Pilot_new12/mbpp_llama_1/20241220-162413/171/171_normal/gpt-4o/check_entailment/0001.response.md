Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs. The function behaves as expected for both even and odd numbers. 

The function's logic is sound and it handles all potential cases correctly. For any integer `n`, the expression `n % 2!= 0` will correctly identify whether the number is odd or not. There are no edge cases that the function does not handle, and it will work correctly for all possible integer inputs. 

In summary, the provided Python function `func_1(n)` is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
