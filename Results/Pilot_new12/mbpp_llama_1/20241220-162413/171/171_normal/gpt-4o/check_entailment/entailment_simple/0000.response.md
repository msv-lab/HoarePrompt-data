Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is an odd integer and `False` if it is an even integer.

The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), then `n` is an odd integer and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, `n` is an even integer and the function returns `False`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm the correctness of the function:

- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because 12 is an even integer.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True` because 7 is an odd integer.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False` because 10 is an even integer.

Since the function behaves as expected for both even and odd inputs, it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
