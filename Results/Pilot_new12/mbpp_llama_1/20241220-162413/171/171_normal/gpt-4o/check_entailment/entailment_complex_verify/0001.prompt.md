You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
Program:
```
assert func_1(12) == False
assert func_1(7) == True
assert func_1(10) == False

def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs. The function behaves as expected for both even and odd numbers. 

The function's logic is sound and it handles all potential cases correctly. For any integer `n`, the expression `n % 2!= 0` will correctly identify whether the number is odd or not. There are no edge cases that the function does not handle, and it will work correctly for all possible integer inputs. 

In summary, the provided Python function `func_1(n)` is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(12) == False
assert func_1(7) == True
assert func_1(10) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given integer `n` is odd or even and returns a boolean value indicating the result. It accepts an integer `n` as input, does not modify it, and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, effectively categorizing any integer input into one of these two states based on its parity.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
