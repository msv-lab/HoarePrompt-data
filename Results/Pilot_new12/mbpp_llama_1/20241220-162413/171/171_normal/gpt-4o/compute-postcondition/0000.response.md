The given code checks if the remainder of the division of `n` by 2 is not equal to 0. This operation determines whether `n` is an odd number. 

Since `n` is an integer, `n % 2!= 0` will be `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

Output State: **The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer**
