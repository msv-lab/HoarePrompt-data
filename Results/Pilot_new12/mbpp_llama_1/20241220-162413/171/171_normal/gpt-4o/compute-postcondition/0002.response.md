Functionality: **The function determines whether a given integer `n` is odd or even and returns a boolean value indicating the result. It accepts an integer `n` as input, does not modify it, and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, effectively categorizing any integer input into one of these two states based on its parity.**
