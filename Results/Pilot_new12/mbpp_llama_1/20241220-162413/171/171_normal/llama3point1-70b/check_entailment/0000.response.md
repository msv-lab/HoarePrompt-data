Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it implicitly returns `False`, indicating that the number is even.

This function works correctly for all integer inputs, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. For example:

- `func_1(3)` returns `True` because 3 is an odd number.
- `func_1(4)` returns `False` because 4 is an even number.
- `func_1(-3)` returns `True` because -3 is an odd number.
- `func_1(-4)` returns `False` because -4 is an even number.
- `func_1(0)` returns `False` because 0 is an even number.

The function does not handle non-integer inputs, but since the problem description specifically mentions "number" without specifying the type, and in the context of parity (odd/even), it generally refers to integers, the function can be considered correct within the scope of the given problem description. However, it's worth noting that in a broader context, adding error handling for non-integer inputs could enhance the function's robustness.
