Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is even.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, stating that the program returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Moreover, the assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program is reasonable in this context, as the problem description does not specify handling non-integer inputs. Therefore, given the information available, the program can be considered correct within the scope of the given problem description.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function works for all integer inputs, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero, which aligns with the expected behavior for determining odd parity.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment, the final evaluation of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
