You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it implicitly returns `False`, indicating that the number is even.

This function works correctly for all integer inputs, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. For example:

- `func_1(3)` returns `True` because 3 is an odd number.
- `func_1(4)` returns `False` because 4 is an even number.
- `func_1(-3)` returns `True` because -3 is an odd number.
- `func_1(-4)` returns `False` because -4 is an even number.
- `func_1(0)` returns `False` because 0 is an even number.

The function does not handle non-integer inputs, but since the problem description specifically mentions "number" without specifying the type, and in the context of parity (odd/even), it generally refers to integers, the function can be considered correct within the scope of the given problem description. However, it's worth noting that in a broader context, adding error handling for non-integer inputs could enhance the function's robustness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, checks whether it is odd or even, and returns a boolean value indicating the result. It returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function does not modify the input parameter `n` and only provides a boolean indication of its parity, handling all integer cases without any exceptions or missing logic.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
