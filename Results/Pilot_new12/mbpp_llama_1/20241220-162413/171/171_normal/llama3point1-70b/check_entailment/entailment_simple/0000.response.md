Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This is achieved through the expression `n % 2!= 0`, which checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If the remainder is not 0, then `n` is odd; otherwise, it is even.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to determine if the parity of a given number is odd. The program correctly handles all potential cases (odd and even integers) and returns the expected result for each case, assuming valid inputs as per the problem's constraints.
