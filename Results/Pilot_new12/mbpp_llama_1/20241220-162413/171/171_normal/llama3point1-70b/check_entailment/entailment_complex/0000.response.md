Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is odd (`True`) or even (`False`). 

The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is even. 

This implementation correctly handles all integer cases and provides the expected boolean indication of the parity of the input number. The program does not modify the input parameter `n` and does not have any exceptions or missing logic for handling different integer cases, as stated in the annotations.

For example, if the input is `n = 5`, the function will return `True` because `5 % 2!= 0`. If the input is `n = 4`, the function will return `False` because `4 % 2 == 0`. 

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given number is odd or even and returns the expected boolean value, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
