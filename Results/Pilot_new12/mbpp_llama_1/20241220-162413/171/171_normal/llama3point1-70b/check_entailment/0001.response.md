Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. This logic aligns with the definition of odd numbers in mathematics, where a number is odd if it cannot be divided evenly by 2.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- For odd numbers, `n % 2` will always be 1, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `True`.
- For even numbers, `n % 2` will always be 0, and thus `n % 2!= 0` will be `False`.

This function does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it fails to handle. It works correctly for both positive and negative integers, as well as for zero. For example, `func_1(-3)` returns `True` (because -3 is an odd number), `func_1(4)` returns `False` (because 4 is an even number), and `func_1(0)` returns `False` (because 0 is considered an even number in mathematics).

Given that the function behaves as expected for all integer inputs, it is considered correct according to the provided problem description.
