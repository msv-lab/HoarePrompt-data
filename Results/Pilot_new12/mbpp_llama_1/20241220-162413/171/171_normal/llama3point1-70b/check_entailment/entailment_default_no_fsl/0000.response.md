Correctness: **True**
The code provided is correct as it accurately determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, checks whether it is odd or even using the modulo operator (`n % 2!= 0`), and returns a boolean value indicating the result. This logic is sound and correctly handles all integer cases. For any odd integer, the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero, so the function correctly returns `True`. Conversely, for any even integer, the remainder when divided by 2 is zero, so the function correctly returns `False`. The output hints support this analysis, describing a function that correctly identifies the parity of input integers without exceptions or missing logic. Therefore, the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.
