Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will not be equal to 0, and the function returns `True`. If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be equal to 0, and the function returns `False`.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function handles all integer cases without any exceptions or missing logic. The function only checks the remainder of `n` divided by 2, which is a valid and efficient way to determine the parity of a number.

Since the function correctly returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, and it handles all integer cases as described in the output hints, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
