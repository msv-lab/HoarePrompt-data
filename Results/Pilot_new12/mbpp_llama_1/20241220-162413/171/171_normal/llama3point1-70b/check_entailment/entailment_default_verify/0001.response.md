Based on the provided problem description, the original assessment, the output hints, and the given code, the program `func_1(n)` appears to correctly determine whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd.

The reasoning provided in the original assessment aligns with the logic in the function, which uses the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. This logic correctly handles both positive and negative integers, as well as zero, as demonstrated in the original assessment.

The output hints also support the correctness of the program, stating that the function takes an integer `n` as input, checks whether it is odd or even, and returns a boolean value indicating the result. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer, which aligns with the problem description.

Given that the output hints provide additional confirmation of the program's behavior and that the original assessment accurately describes the function's logic, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect.

Therefore, the original assessment of **True** is maintained because the provided code, the output hints, and the problem description all align and indicate that the function correctly determines whether a given number is odd.

Final: **True**
