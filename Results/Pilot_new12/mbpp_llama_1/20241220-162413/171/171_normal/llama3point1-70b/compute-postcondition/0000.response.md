To calculate the result of the given code, we need to understand what `n % 2!= 0` means. This expression checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. In simpler terms, it checks if `n` is an odd number.

Given that `n` is an integer, `n % 2!= 0` will return `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

Output State: **The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer**
