Correctness: **True**

The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure into a one-dimensional list. The function recursively traverses the input list, handling nested lists of arbitrary depth. If an item in the list is itself a list, the function calls itself with this sublist; otherwise, it appends the item to the result list.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, describing a process that matches the recursive flattening of the input list. The hints also mention that non-integer and non-list elements will be included in the output without error handling, which aligns with the provided code.

Given the problem description and the examples provided in the `assert` statements, the function appears to handle various cases correctly, including:

1. Nested lists with multiple levels of nesting.
2. Lists containing a mix of integers and sublists.
3. Empty lists or lists containing only integers.

Since we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a list that does or does not contain nested lists and integers), the function's design seems appropriate for its intended purpose. There are no apparent cases where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description, making the code correct for all potential valid inputs.
