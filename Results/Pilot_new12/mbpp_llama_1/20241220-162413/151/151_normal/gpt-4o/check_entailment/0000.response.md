Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively traverses the input list, checking each item to determine if it is a list itself or a single element. If an item is a list, the function calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it and adding its elements to the `flat_list`. If an item is not a list, it is directly appended to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all nested lists have been flattened, resulting in a single-level list containing all elements from the original nested structure.

The function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and complexity, including empty lists and lists containing a mix of integers and other lists. The recursive approach allows it to elegantly manage lists within lists, regardless of how deeply nested they are.

Given the provided unit tests and the logic of the function, it appears to correctly flatten any given nested list structure as described in the problem statement. Without being able to identify a case where the function fails to produce the expected output, we conclude that the function is correct for all potential inputs. 

However, one potential edge case to consider is how the function handles non-list inputs or inputs containing non-integer, non-list elements (such as strings, floats, or other types of objects). The function, as it stands, does not explicitly check the type of non-list elements, so it would append them to the `flat_list` regardless of their type. This could be considered correct behavior if the intention is to flatten lists while preserving the type of all elements within those lists. But if the expectation is that the function should only work with lists of integers, additional error checking would be necessary to handle or reject other types of elements. 

Given the information provided and focusing strictly on the task of flattening nested lists, the function appears to be correct and functional for its intended purpose.
