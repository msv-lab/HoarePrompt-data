Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description, which asks to write a function to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's why the program always meets the requirements in the problem description:
- The function `func_1` accepts a nested list as input and processes it recursively. 
- If an item in the list is itself a list, the function calls itself with that sublist, effectively flattening it. 
- If an item is not a list (i.e., it's an integer or some other type), it's simply appended to the `flat_list`.
- This process repeats until all sublists have been flattened, resulting in a one-dimensional list containing all the elements from the original nested list.
- The function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, including the case where the input list is empty or contains only integers.
- The function does not modify or remove non-integer and non-list elements; it treats them as regular elements and includes them in the output list.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, it is correct. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate its correctness for various input scenarios.
