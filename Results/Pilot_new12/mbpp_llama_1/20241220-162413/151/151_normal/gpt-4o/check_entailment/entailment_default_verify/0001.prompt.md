You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a recursive function named `func_1` that is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. The function works by iterating through each item in the input list. If an item is itself a list, the function calls itself with that sublist as an argument, effectively flattening the nested structure by extending the main list with the results of the recursive call. If an item is not a list, it simply appends that item to the flat list.

This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are eventually added to the `flat_list`, resulting in a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original nested list.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover various scenarios, including lists with multiple levels of nesting and lists containing both nested lists and individual elements.

Given the recursive nature of the function and the fact that it correctly handles both nested lists and individual elements, it seems to work as expected for all potential cases. Without being able to identify a specific case where the function fails to produce the correct output according to its problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a nested list that can contain integers and/or other lists as input, processes it recursively to flatten the nested structure, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all the integers from the original nested list. The input list remains unchanged, and the function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, including the case where the input list is empty or contains only integers. If the input list contains non-integer and non-list elements, the function will include these elements in the output list without modification or error handling, effectively treating them as regular elements. After the function call, the output list will contain all the elements from the original nested list, but in a flattened structure.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
