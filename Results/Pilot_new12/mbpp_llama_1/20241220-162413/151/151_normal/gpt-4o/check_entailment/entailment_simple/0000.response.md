Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the problem description by implementing a recursive function to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's why it always works as expected:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through each item in the `nested_list`.
2. If the item is a list (detected using `isinstance(item, list)`), the function calls itself with this sublist (`func_1(item)`) and extends the `flat_list` with the result, effectively flattening the sublist.
3. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the `flat_list`.
4. This recursive process continues until all nested structures are flattened, and the `flat_list` contains all the integers from the original `nested_list` in the correct order.

Since the program handles each item in the `nested_list` according to its type (list or not), it correctly flattens the structure as required by the problem description. The recursion ensures that the flattening occurs to any depth within the `nested_list`, making the solution comprehensive and accurate.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid and the program does not need to handle edge cases like empty lists or non-list inputs, the provided implementation accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
