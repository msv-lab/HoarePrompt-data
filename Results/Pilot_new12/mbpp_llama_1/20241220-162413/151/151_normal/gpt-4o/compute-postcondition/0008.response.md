To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program and calculate the result based on the initial state provided.


Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 2 items.
- `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
```

This code calls a function `func_1` with `item` as its argument and extends `flat_list` with the result returned by `func_1(item)`.


Since `item` is the second item in `nested_list`, and `nested_list` can contain integers and/or other lists, `item` can be either an integer or a list.


However, without knowing the specifics of what `func_1` does, we can only infer that `func_1(item)` returns an iterable (like a list or tuple) because it's being used with the `extend` method, which adds all items from the iterable to the end of `flat_list`.


Given this, the output state will reflect the changes to `flat_list` based on the operation performed by `func_1` on `item`, while other initial conditions remain unchanged.


Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(item)`.**
