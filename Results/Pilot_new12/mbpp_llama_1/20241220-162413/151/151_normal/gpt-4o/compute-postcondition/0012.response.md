To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 3 items.
- `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`.

The given code is: 
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
```

This code extends the `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. 

Since `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, and `nested_list` can contain integers and/or other lists, `item` can also be either an integer or a list.

However, without knowing the definition or behavior of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact nature or values of the elements that will be added to `flat_list`. 

Assuming `func_1` is a function that takes an item (which can be an integer or a list) and returns a list of values (which could be integers or could be the result of further processing if the item is a list), then:

- If `item` is an integer, `func_1(item)` will return a list based on the integer `item`.
- If `item` is a list, `func_1(item)` will return a list based on the list `item`.

Therefore, the `flat_list` will be extended by the list returned by `func_1(item)`, but without knowing what `func_1` does exactly, we can only say that `flat_list` now includes additional elements resulting from `func_1(item)`.

The states of `nested_list` and `item` are not changed by this operation.

So, the output state, considering the information and the code provided, and without specific details about `func_1`, is:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been extended by the result of `func_1(item)`.**
