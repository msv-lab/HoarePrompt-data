According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 2 items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, and `item` must be the second item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` will contain the flattened version of the second item. If `item` is not a list, it is an integer and `flat_list` will contain the second item.
State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`**
