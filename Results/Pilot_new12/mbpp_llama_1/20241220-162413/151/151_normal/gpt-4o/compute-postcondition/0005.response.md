The code appends the value of `item` to the `flat_list`. The `item` is the first item in the `nested_list` and it is an integer. 

The value of `flat_list` is updated to contain the first item of the `nested_list`, which is an integer.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` is a list containing the first item of `nested_list`, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list` and `item` is not a list, it is an integer**
