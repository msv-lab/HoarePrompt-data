Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all its previous items and the second item of `nested_list`.**
