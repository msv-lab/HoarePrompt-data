To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 1 item.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- The current value of `item` is the first item in the `nested_list` and `item` is a list.

The code is: `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))`

Since `item` is a list and it's the first item in `nested_list`, and we're extending `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`, we need to consider what `func_1(item)` does. However, the specifics of `func_1` are not provided in the problem statement. 

For the sake of analysis, let's assume `func_1` is a function that flattens a list (since the context suggests we're moving from a nested structure to a flat one). If `func_1` indeed flattens the list, then `flat_list` will be extended with the flattened version of `item`.

Given the information and the assumption about `func_1`, the output state would be:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged as it's not directly modified by the given code.
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains the flattened version of `item`, which is the first item in `nested_list`.
- The value of `item` remains the same as it's not changed by the extension operation on `flat_list`.

Therefore, considering `func_1` as a list flattening function, the output state is:
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the first item in `nested_list`, and `item` is the first item in `nested_list`, which is a list.**
