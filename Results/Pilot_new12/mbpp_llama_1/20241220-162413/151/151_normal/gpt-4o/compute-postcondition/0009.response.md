The given code `flat_list.append(item)` will append the value of `item` to `flat_list`. 

The `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`. 

The impact of the code on the program is that `flat_list` now contains an additional element which is the second item of `nested_list`.

The states of `nested_list` and `item` are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains all its previous items and the second item of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains all its previous items and the second item of `nested_list`.**
