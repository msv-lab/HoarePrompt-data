Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` has been extended by the result of `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all its previous elements plus the value of `item` as its last element.***
