To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states provided for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over each item in the `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it extends the `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the `flat_list`.

From the output states provided, we can see that:

- After the loop executes 1 time, `nested_list` must have at least 1 item, and `flat_list` contains either the first item of `nested_list` (if it's an integer) or the flattened version of the first item (if it's a list).
- After the loop executes 2 times, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, and `flat_list` contains the first item (or its flattened version) and the second item (or its flattened version).
- After the loop executes 3 times, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and `flat_list` contains the first item (or its flattened version), the second item (or its flattened version), and the third item (or its flattened version).

Based on this pattern, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `nested_list` will have been fully traversed, and `flat_list` will contain the flattened version of all items in `nested_list`.

If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `flat_list` will remain an empty list.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `flat_list` contains the flattened version of all items in the original `nested_list`, and `nested_list` is the original list that can contain integers and/or other lists.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the original `nested_list`.**
