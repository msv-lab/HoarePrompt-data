According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 1 item, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and `flat_list` is an empty list, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must have at least 1 item and `item` is now the first item in the `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`**
