Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the flattened version of `item`. If `item` is not a list, it is an integer and `flat_list` contains `item`.**
