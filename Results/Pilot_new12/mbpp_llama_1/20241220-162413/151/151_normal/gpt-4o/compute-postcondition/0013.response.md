To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`.

The code snippet is: `flat_list.append(item)`

Given that `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, this code appends the value of `item` to `flat_list`. The type and value of `item` can vary since `nested_list` can contain integers and/or other lists.

Since `nested_list` must have at least 3 items and `item` is specified as the third item, the structure of `nested_list` can be represented as follows: `[any_item1, any_item2, item,...]`.

After executing the code, the value of `item` is appended to `flat_list`. The nature of `item` (whether it's an integer or another list) isn't specified, so we consider that `flat_list` now contains the third item of `nested_list`, whatever its nature.

The initial state also mentions that `nested_list` has at least 3 items, but it does not restrict the number of items or their types beyond that. 

The state of `nested_list` and the fact that `item` is its third item do not change. What changes is that `flat_list` now includes the value or reference of `item` as its last element.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` contains all its previous elements plus the value of `item` as its last element.**
