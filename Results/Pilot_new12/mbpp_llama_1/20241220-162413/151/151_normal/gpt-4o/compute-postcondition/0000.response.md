The given code initializes an empty list `flat_list`. The initial state mentions a `nested_list`, but the provided code does not directly interact with it. However, based on the context, it seems like the intention might be to eventually flatten the `nested_list` into the `flat_list`. Since the code only initializes `flat_list` and does not perform any operations on `nested_list`, we consider the immediate effect of the given code snippet.

The value of `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the initialization of `flat_list`. Therefore, `nested_list` is still a list that can contain integers and/or other lists. The new variable `flat_list` is assigned an empty list as its value.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is an empty list**
