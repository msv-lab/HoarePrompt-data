Functionality: **The function accepts a nested list that can contain integers and/or other lists as input, processes it recursively to flatten the nested structure, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all the integers from the original nested list. The input list remains unchanged, and the function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, including the case where the input list is empty or contains only integers. If the input list contains non-integer and non-list elements, the function will include these elements in the output list without modification or error handling, effectively treating them as regular elements. After the function call, the output list will contain all the elements from the original nested list, but in a flattened structure.**
