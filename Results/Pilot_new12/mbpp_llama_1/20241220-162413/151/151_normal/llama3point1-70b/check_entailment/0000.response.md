Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It works recursively by iterating over each element in the input list. If the element is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist as the argument and extends the `flat_list` with the result of this recursive call. If the element is not a list, it is appended to the `flat_list`. 

This approach correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, as it continues to recursively flatten any sublists it encounters. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], 6]`, the function will correctly return the flattened list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

The function also correctly handles the base case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list, and it handles the case where the list contains no nested lists, returning the original list.

There are no obvious edge cases where the function would not work as expected. It handles nested lists of integers, but it would also work correctly with nested lists containing other types of elements, such as strings or floats, because it does not perform any type-specific operations. 

Therefore, based on the analysis of the function's logic and its handling of different cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the described functionality for all potential cases.
