Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that flattens a given nested list structure, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input and initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
2. It then iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`.
3. If `i` is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on `i` and extends the `flat_list` with the result. This is the key step that allows the function to flatten the nested list structure.
4. If `i` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer), it simply appends `i` to the `flat_list`.
5. After iterating over all elements in the `nested_list`, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`.

The program handles the nested list structure correctly by recursively flattening any inner lists and appending the non-list elements to the `flat_list`. Since we assume the input is valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function will correctly flatten any given nested list structure.

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7]`, the function will correctly return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
