Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input and returns a new `flat_list` containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. 

Here's why the code is correct:

- It handles nested lists of arbitrary depth by recursively calling itself for each sublist encountered.
- It correctly handles cases where the input list is empty, contains only integers, contains only lists, or a combination of both.
- It does not modify the original input list, as required.
- It does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list or non-integer inputs, but this is acceptable given the assumption that the input will be valid.

The output hints provided agree with the functionality of the code and demonstrate its ability to flatten nested lists while preserving the original list and handling various combinations of integers and sublists.

Since the code adheres to the problem description for every potential valid case and there are no examples where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is **True**.
