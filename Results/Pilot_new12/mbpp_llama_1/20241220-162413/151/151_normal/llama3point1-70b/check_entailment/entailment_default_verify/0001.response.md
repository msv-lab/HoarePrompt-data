Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of correctness as **True** appears to be accurate. The code defines a recursive function `func_1` that takes a `nested_list` as input, iterates over each element, and either appends it to the `flat_list` if it's not a list or recursively calls itself if the element is a list. This process effectively flattens the nested list structure into a single-level list, which aligns with the problem description.

The output hints further support the correctness of the original assessment by detailing the function's behavior, including its ability to handle various cases such as empty lists, lists with only integers, lists with only nested lists, and combinations thereof. The output hints also correctly note that the function does not modify the original list and does not perform error checking for non-list or non-integer inputs, which is consistent with the assumption that the input will be valid.

The original assessment methodically evaluates the function's behavior across different scenarios, confirming its ability to correctly flatten nested lists of arbitrary depth without modifying the original list or requiring error handling for invalid inputs. Given that the code and the output hints align with the problem description and that the assessment covers a comprehensive range of cases, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment should be altered.

Therefore, considering all the provided information, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains in agreement with the original assessment.

Final: **True**
