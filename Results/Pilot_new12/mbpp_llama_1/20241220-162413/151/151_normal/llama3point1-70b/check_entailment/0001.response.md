Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, is designed to flatten a nested list structure. It uses recursion to iterate over each element in the nested list. If the element is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist; if the element is not a list, it is appended to the result list (`flat_list`). This approach ensures that all nested lists, regardless of their depth, are properly flattened into a single-level list.

I have considered various cases, including:

1. **Empty List**: Passing an empty list `[]` to `func_1` returns an empty list, which is the correct behavior.
2. **List with Only Simple Elements**: A list containing only integers or strings (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) is returned as is, since there's nothing to flatten.
3. **List with Nested Lists**: A list like `[1, [2, 3], 4, [5, [6, 7]]]` is correctly flattened to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
4. **Deeply Nested Lists**: The function handles lists nested to any depth, making it versatile for complex list structures.
5. **List Containing Other Types**: If the list contains other types (like tuples, dictionaries), the function will treat them as simple elements and include them in the flattened list, which aligns with the problem description focusing on list structures.

Since the function behaves as expected in all these cases and handles recursion correctly to flatten nested lists of arbitrary depth, it is considered correct.
