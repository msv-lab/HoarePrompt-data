The original assessment states that the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality to flatten a given nested list structure. The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the state of the program at different points, which supports the original assessment.

The annotations indicate that before the function call, `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, which aligns with the problem description. The state of the program after the `for` loop has been executed shows that `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`. This indicates that the function is correctly flattening the nested list structure.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, correctly handles the base case where the input list is empty, and handles the case where the list contains no nested lists. The assessment also notes that the function would work correctly with nested lists containing other types of elements, such as strings or floats, because it does not perform any type-specific operations.

Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, it appears that the program correctly implements the described functionality. The annotations provide additional evidence that the function is correctly flattening the nested list structure, and there are no indications of any incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program's correctness can be confirmed.

Final: **True**
