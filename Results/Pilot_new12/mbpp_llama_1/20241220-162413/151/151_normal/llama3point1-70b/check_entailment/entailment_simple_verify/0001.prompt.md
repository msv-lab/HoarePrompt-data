You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, is designed to flatten a nested list structure. It uses recursion to iterate over each element in the nested list. If the element is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist; if the element is not a list, it is appended to the result list (`flat_list`). This approach ensures that all nested lists, regardless of their depth, are properly flattened into a single-level list.

I have considered various cases, including:

1. **Empty List**: Passing an empty list `[]` to `func_1` returns an empty list, which is the correct behavior.
2. **List with Only Simple Elements**: A list containing only integers or strings (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) is returned as is, since there's nothing to flatten.
3. **List with Nested Lists**: A list like `[1, [2, 3], 4, [5, [6, 7]]]` is correctly flattened to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
4. **Deeply Nested Lists**: The function handles lists nested to any depth, making it versatile for complex list structures.
5. **List Containing Other Types**: If the list contains other types (like tuples, dictionaries), the function will treat them as simple elements and include them in the flattened list, which aligns with the problem description focusing on list structures.

Since the function behaves as expected in all these cases and handles recursion correctly to flatten nested lists of arbitrary depth, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`, `i` is the last element of `nested_list` if `nested_list` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all non-list elements from the original nested_list and the results of func_1 applied to any list elements found in the original nested_list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
