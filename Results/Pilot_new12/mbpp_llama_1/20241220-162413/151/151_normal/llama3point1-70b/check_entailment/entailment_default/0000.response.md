Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code is designed to flatten a given nested list structure, and it appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The function `func_1` recursively traverses the input `nested_list`, checking each element to determine if it's a list or a non-list element. If the element is a list, it extends the `flat_list` with the result of a recursive call to `func_1` on that sublist. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all nested lists are properly flattened and all elements are brought to the top level.

The output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including an empty input list, a list containing only integers, a list containing only lists, or a combination of both integers and lists. The function also does not modify the original input list and does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list or non-integer inputs, which aligns with the assumption that the input will always be valid.

Given the recursive nature of the function and its logic to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth, it appears to correctly implement the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input. Therefore, the code is considered correct based on the provided information.
