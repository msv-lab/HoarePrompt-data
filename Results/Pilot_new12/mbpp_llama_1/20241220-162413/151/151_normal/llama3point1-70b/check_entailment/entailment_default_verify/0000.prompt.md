You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It works recursively by iterating over each element in the input list. If the element is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist as the argument and extends the `flat_list` with the result of this recursive call. If the element is not a list, it is appended to the `flat_list`. 

This approach correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, as it continues to recursively flatten any sublists it encounters. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], 6]`, the function will correctly return the flattened list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

The function also correctly handles the base case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list, and it handles the case where the list contains no nested lists, returning the original list.

There are no obvious edge cases where the function would not work as expected. It handles nested lists of integers, but it would also work correctly with nested lists containing other types of elements, such as strings or floats, because it does not perform any type-specific operations. 

Therefore, based on the analysis of the function's logic and its handling of different cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the described functionality for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list (`nested_list`) containing integers and/or other lists as input, and returns a new flat list (`flat_list`) containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. The function recursively flattens any nested lists, effectively removing all nesting and concatenating the elements into a single list. The function handles cases where the input list is empty, contains only integers, contains only lists, or a combination of both. The function does not modify the original input list and does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list or non-integer inputs. After execution, the program returns a flat list where all nested lists have been removed, and all elements are at the top level, regardless of their original nesting depth.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
