Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to flatten a given nested list structure, which means that it should take a list that can contain integers and/or other lists as input and return a new flat list containing all non-list elements from the original list.

The provided program does exactly that. It uses a recursive approach to flatten the nested list. When it encounters a list element, it calls itself with that list element as the new input, effectively flattening the nested list. When it encounters a non-list element, it simply appends it to the flat list.

The program handles all cases mentioned in the problem description:

- It handles cases where the input list is empty: In this case, the function will simply return an empty list.
- It handles cases where the input list contains only integers: In this case, the function will simply return the original list.
- It handles cases where the input list contains only lists: In this case, the function will recursively flatten the nested lists.
- It handles cases where the input list contains a combination of both integers and lists: In this case, the function will recursively flatten the nested lists and append the integers to the flat list.

The program does not modify the original input list, which is also in line with the problem description. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to worry about error handling.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it correct.
