The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. Since `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, this operation adds the third element of `nested_list` to `flat_list`.

Given that `flat_list` initially contains the previous elements of `nested_list`, after executing the code, `flat_list` will contain all elements up to and including the third element of `nested_list`.

Therefore, the state of `nested_list` remains unchanged as it has at least 3 elements, and `i` is still the third element in `nested_list`. The state of `flat_list` is updated to include `i`, which is the third element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains all elements up to and including the third element of `nested_list`.**
