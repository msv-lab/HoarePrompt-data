The given code appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is the first element in `nested_list` and is not a list, its type can be any non-list type (e.g., integer, string, etc.). 

Before the code execution, `flat_list` is empty. After executing the code, `flat_list` will contain the value of `i`. 

The states of `nested_list` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, the type of `i` is not a list, and `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, which is `i`.**
