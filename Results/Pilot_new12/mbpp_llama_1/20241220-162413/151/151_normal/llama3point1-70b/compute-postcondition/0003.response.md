To accurately determine the output state, we need to consider the effects of the given Python code snippet on the initial state. The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `nested_list` must have at least one element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- The first element in `nested_list`, referred to as `i`, is a list.

Given the code snippet:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
```
Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. **Function Impact**: The code calls `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is a list itself. However, without the definition of `func_1`, we can only speculate that it processes `i` (a list) and returns a value or a list of values that can be extended into `flat_list`.
2. **Extension of `flat_list`**: The `extend` method adds all the elements from the list returned by `func_1(i)` to the end of `flat_list`. Initially, `flat_list` is empty, so it will contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)` after execution.

Considering the information available and the nature of the function call:
- The value of `nested_list` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it; it still has at least one element, with the first element being a list `i`.
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains all the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.
- The definition of `i` remains the same; it is the first element of `nested_list` and is a list.

Therefore, the output state, given the constraints and without the specific definition of `func_1`, is as follows:
- `nested_list` has at least one element, with the first element `i` being a list.
- `flat_list` contains all elements returned by `func_1(i)`, making it non-empty.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as the first element of `nested_list`, which is a list.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least one element with the first element `i` being a list, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(i)` and is non-empty, and `i` remains a list as the first element of `nested_list`.**
