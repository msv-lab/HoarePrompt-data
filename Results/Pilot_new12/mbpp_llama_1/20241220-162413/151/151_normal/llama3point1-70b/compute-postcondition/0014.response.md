Postcondition: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the first two elements of `nested_list` and the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains all elements up to and including the third element of `nested_list`.**
