The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. 

Given the initial state: `nested_list` has at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(i)` and is non-empty. If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the second element of `nested_list`, which is `i`.

The value of `i` is appended to `flat_list`, so `flat_list` now contains its previous elements and the additional element `i`. 

The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` has at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(i)` and `i`, and is non-empty. If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the second element of `nested_list`, which is `i`, and `i` again.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its previous elements and `i`**
