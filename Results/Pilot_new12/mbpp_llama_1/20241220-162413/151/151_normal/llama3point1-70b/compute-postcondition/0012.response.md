The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` extends the `flat_list` by adding all elements returned by `func_1(i)` to the end of `flat_list`. Given the initial state:

- `nested_list` has at least 3 elements
- `i` is the third element in `nested_list`
- `flat_list` contains the previous elements of `nested_list` (implying it has at least the first two elements of `nested_list`)

The impact of this code on the program is that it modifies `flat_list` by appending the result of `func_1(i)` to it. Since `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` initially contains the first two elements of `nested_list`, after the execution, `flat_list` will contain the first two elements of `nested_list` and the result of `func_1(i)`.

Given that `func_1(i)` is a function that takes `i` (the third element of `nested_list`) as an input and returns a value (or a list of values, since `extend` is used), the exact content of `flat_list` after the execution depends on what `func_1(i)` returns. However, we can describe the outcome based on the given information.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the first two elements of `nested_list` and the elements returned by `func_1(i)`**
