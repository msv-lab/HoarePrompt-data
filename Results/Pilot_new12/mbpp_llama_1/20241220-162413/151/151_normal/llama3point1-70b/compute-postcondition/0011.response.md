According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements and `i` must be the third element in `nested_list`. Additionally, `flat_list` will contain its previous elements plus the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` is a list, otherwise it will contain its previous elements and `i`, but since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to consider the result of `func_1(i)` yet. 
State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its previous elements**
