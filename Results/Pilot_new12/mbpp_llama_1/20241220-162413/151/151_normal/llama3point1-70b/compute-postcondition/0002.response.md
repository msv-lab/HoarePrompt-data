Postcondition: **`nested_list` must have at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, the first element in `nested_list`, referred to as `i`, is a list, and given that `i` is a list, it is the current value of `i` from this point onwards, maintaining the initial conditions that `nested_list` has at least one element and `flat_list` remains empty**
