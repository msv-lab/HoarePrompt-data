To determine the state at the start of the for loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists
- `flat_list` is an empty list

And the loop statement:
```python
for i in nested_list:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if `nested_list` is not empty, regardless of whether it contains integers, other lists, or a mix of both. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `nested_list` during each iteration.

The state of `flat_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop, as the loop iterates over `nested_list`. However, for the loop to execute, `nested_list` must have at least one element.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `nested_list` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element in `nested_list` at the start of the loop.

State: **`nested_list` must have at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
