To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code based on the initial state provided:

- `nested_list` has at least two elements.
- `i` is the second element in `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(i)` and is non-empty.
- If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the second element of `nested_list`, which is `i`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
```

Given this, let's consider what happens to the variables:

1. **Impact on `flat_list`:** The code extends `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. This implies that regardless of whether `i` is a list or not, `flat_list` will now include the results of `func_1(i)` in addition to any elements it previously contained.

2. **State of `i`:** The code does not modify `i` itself; it only uses `i` as an argument for `func_1(i)`. Therefore, the nature of `i` (whether it's a list or not) remains unchanged.

3. **State of `nested_list`:** There's no operation performed directly on `nested_list`, so its state remains unchanged.

Considering the initial conditions and the changes induced by the code, we can conclude:

- `nested_list` still has at least two elements.
- `i` remains the second element in `nested_list`, with its nature (list or not) unchanged.
- `flat_list` now contains its original elements (if `i` was not a list, it contained `i`; if `i` was a list, it contained elements returned by `func_1(i)`) plus the additional elements returned by the current call to `func_1(i)`.

Therefore, the detailed output state, considering all possible conditions, is as follows:

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains its previous elements plus the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, which are added to its existing content (whether it was `i` itself or the result of a previous `func_1(i)` call)**.
