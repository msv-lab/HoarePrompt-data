Based on the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer the following:

- The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list, it calls `func_1(i)` and extends `flat_list` with the returned elements.
- If `i` is not a list, it simply appends `i` to `flat_list`.
- The loop will execute at least once if `nested_list` is not empty.
- The value of `i` changes with each iteration, taking on the value of the current element being processed in `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` accumulates elements from `nested_list`, either directly if an element is not a list or indirectly through the function `func_1` if an element is a list.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following can be concluded:

- `nested_list` retains its original value, as the loop only reads from it and does not modify it.
- `i` will hold the value of the last element processed in `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` will contain all non-list elements from `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to any list elements found in `nested_list`.

If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `flat_list` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`, `i` is the last element of `nested_list` if `nested_list` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution.**
