According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least one element, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least two elements. So, `i` should be the second element in `nested_list`. 

If `i` is a list, `flat_list` should contain elements returned by `func_1(i)` and should be non-empty. 
If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` should contain the second element of `nested_list`, which is `i`.

State: **`nested_list` has at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` contains elements returned by `func_1(i)` and is non-empty. If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the second element of `nested_list`, which is `i`**
