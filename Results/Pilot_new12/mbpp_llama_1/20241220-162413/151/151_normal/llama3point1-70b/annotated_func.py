#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` contains all non-list elements from the original `nested_list` and the results of `func_1` applied to any list elements found in the original `nested_list`, `i` is the last element of `nested_list` if `nested_list` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all non-list elements from the original nested_list and the results of func_1 applied to any list elements found in the original nested_list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list (`nested_list`) containing integers and/or other lists as input, and returns a new flat list (`flat_list`) containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. The function recursively flattens any nested lists, effectively removing all nesting and concatenating the elements into a single list. The function handles cases where the input list is empty, contains only integers, contains only lists, or a combination of both. The function does not modify the original input list and does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list or non-integer inputs. After execution, the program returns a flat list where all nested lists have been removed, and all elements are at the top level, regardless of their original nesting depth.
