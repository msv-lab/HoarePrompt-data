The function accepts a list (`nested_list`) containing integers and/or other lists as input, and returns a new flat list (`flat_list`) containing all non-list elements from the original `nested_list`. The function recursively flattens any nested lists, effectively removing all nesting and concatenating the elements into a single list. The function handles cases where the input list is empty, contains only integers, contains only lists, or a combination of both. The function does not modify the original input list and does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list or non-integer inputs. After execution, the program returns a flat list where all nested lists have been removed, and all elements are at the top level, regardless of their original nesting depth.
