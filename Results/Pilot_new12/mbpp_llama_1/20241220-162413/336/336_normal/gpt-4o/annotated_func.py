#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd if the function does not return `False`; otherwise, it returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even element at an odd index. The variable `i`, if the loop completes, will be the last odd index in `lst` that was checked. If `lst` has one or zero elements, the loop does not execute, and the state of `lst` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating all elements at odd indices in `lst` are odd if any checking occurred, or `lst` is too short for such checking, and `lst` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if all elements at odd indices in the input list `lst` are odd. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the list has one or zero elements, or if all elements at odd indices are odd, the function returns `True`. The input list `lst` remains unchanged after the function execution. The function handles edge cases where the list is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns `True` without modifying the list. The function's postconditions are met, and it correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices in the input list.
