Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. 

The function `func_1` iterates over the list with a step of 2, starting from the second element (index 1), which is the first odd index. It checks if each element at an odd index is odd by using the modulo operator (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the program. 

For example, `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because all the numbers at odd indices (1, 3, 7, 3) are odd. On the other hand, `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because the number at index 1 (which is an odd index) is 2, which is even. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
