Based on the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I have examined the function `func_1` to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, meaning it accurately checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. This assessment is supported by the unit tests provided:

- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: The function correctly identifies that the odd indices have odd numbers.
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: The function correctly identifies that the only odd index (1) has an odd number.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The function correctly identifies that an odd index contains an even number, failing the condition.

The output hints further elaborate on the function's behavior:
- It checks if all elements at odd indices in the input list `lst` are odd.
- It immediately returns `False` if any element at an odd index is even.
- It handles lists with one or zero elements by returning `True` without modifying the list.
- The function correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices and meets its postconditions.

Considering the output hints, they fully align with the behavior described in the original assessment. The hints provide additional details but do not contradict the original assessment. They emphasize the function's correctness by detailing its behavior for various input scenarios, including edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element.

Given this examination, the original assessment is maintained because it accurately reflects the function's behavior as intended by the problem description. The output hints support the assessment by providing a more detailed explanation of the function's operation, including how it handles different types of input lists, without identifying any deviation from the expected behavior.

Final: **True**
