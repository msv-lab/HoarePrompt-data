After carefully reviewing the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

The program checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number, and it does so correctly. The function `func_1` iterates over the list with a step of 2, starting from the second element (index 1), which is the first odd index. It checks if each element at an odd index is odd by using the modulo operator (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the program. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points, including the state of the program before and after the function call, and the state of the program after the `for` loop has been executed. The annotations also correctly describe the postconditions of the function, including the fact that the input list `lst` remains unchanged after the function execution.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the program's behavior and postconditions. The assessment notes that the program correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number, and it provides examples to support this claim. The assessment also notes that the unit tests provided support the correctness of the program.

Therefore, I see no reason to change the original assessment. The program meets the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
