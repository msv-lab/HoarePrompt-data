Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description because it checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the list using a for loop with a step size of 2, starting from index 1. This ensures that it only checks the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5,...).

2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `lst[i]` is even by using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If it finds an even element at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`.

3. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements at odd indices in the list are odd.

4. The function handles edge cases correctly. If the list has one or zero elements, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `True`. This is because the problem description does not specify any conditions for lists with one or zero elements, and the function's behavior in this case is consistent with the spirit of the problem.

5. The function does not modify the input list `lst`, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. The function's postconditions are met, and it correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices in the input list.

Overall, the program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
