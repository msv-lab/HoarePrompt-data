You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (i.e., every odd index). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior:

- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: The odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) contain odd numbers (1, 3, 7, 3), so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: The odd indices (1) contain an odd number (1), so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The odd index (1) contains an even number (2), so the function returns `False`.

After examining the function and the provided unit tests, it appears that the function correctly implements the described behavior. It handles lists of varying lengths and correctly checks every odd index for odd numbers. Without finding a specific case where the function fails to meet the problem description, it's concluded that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd if the function does not return `False`; otherwise, it returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even element at an odd index. The variable `i`, if the loop completes, will be the last odd index in `lst` that was checked. If `lst` has one or zero elements, the loop does not execute, and the state of `lst` remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating all elements at odd indices in `lst` are odd if any checking occurred, or `lst` is too short for such checking, and `lst` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if all elements at odd indices in the input list `lst` are odd. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the list has one or zero elements, or if all elements at odd indices are odd, the function returns `True`. The input list `lst` remains unchanged after the function execution. The function handles edge cases where the list is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns `True` without modifying the list. The function's postconditions are met, and it correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices in the input list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
