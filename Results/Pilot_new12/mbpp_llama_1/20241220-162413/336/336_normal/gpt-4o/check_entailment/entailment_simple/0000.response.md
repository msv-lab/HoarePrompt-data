Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. Here's why:

1. The program iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (with a step of 2). This ensures that it's checking only the elements at odd indices.

2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is even (using the modulo operator, `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it is, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not every odd index contains an odd number.

3. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases:

* If the list has only one element, the loop doesn't execute, and the function returns `True` (since there are no odd indices in a list with a single element).
* If the list is empty, the loop also doesn't execute, and the function returns `True` (since there are no elements to check).

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, checking whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.
