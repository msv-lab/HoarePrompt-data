Correctness: **True**

The code correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in a given list. It iterates over the list, starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (i.e., the elements at odd indices). If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements at odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

The code handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the list is empty or has only one element, it returns `True` without modifying the list. The function also correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices in the input list.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the code works as expected. For instance, `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` and `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` demonstrate that the function correctly returns `True` for lists where every odd index contains an odd number. On the other hand, `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` shows that the function correctly returns `False` for lists where an even number is found at an odd index.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for every potential case.
