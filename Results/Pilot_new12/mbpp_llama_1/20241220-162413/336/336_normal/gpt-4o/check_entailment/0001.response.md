Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function iterates over the list starting from the second element (index 1) and checks every other element (i.e., every odd index). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's behavior:

- `assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: The odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) contain odd numbers (1, 3, 7, 3), so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: The odd indices (1) contain an odd number (1), so the function returns `True`.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The odd index (1) contains an even number (2), so the function returns `False`.

After examining the function and the provided unit tests, it appears that the function correctly implements the described behavior. It handles lists of varying lengths and correctly checks every odd index for odd numbers. Without finding a specific case where the function fails to meet the problem description, it's concluded that the function is correct.
