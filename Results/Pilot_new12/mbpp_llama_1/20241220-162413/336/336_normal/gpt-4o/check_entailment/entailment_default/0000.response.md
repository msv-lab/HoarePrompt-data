Correctness: **True**

The code correctly checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. It iterates over the list at odd indices (starting from 1, with a step of 2), and for each element, it checks if the element is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even element at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all odd indices without finding an even element, it returns `True`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the code:

- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` is correct because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd (1, 3, 7, 3).
- `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` is correct because the only element at an odd index (1) is odd (1).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` is correct because the element at the second odd index (2) is even (2).

The output hints agree with the code, describing it as checking if all elements at odd indices are odd and returning a boolean value accordingly. The hints also correctly describe the function's behavior for edge cases, such as when the list has one or zero elements, or when all elements at odd indices are odd. 

Therefore, the code correctly implements the function as described in the problem description and handles all potential cases as expected.
