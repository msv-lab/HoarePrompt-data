The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it checks the elements at odd indices in `lst` and returns `True` if all elements at odd indices are odd or if `lst` is too short for such checking, and returns `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, checks if all elements at odd indices are odd, and returns True if the condition is met or the list is too short; otherwise, it returns False.**
