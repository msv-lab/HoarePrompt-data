Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if all elements at odd indices in the input list `lst` are odd. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the list has one or zero elements, or if all elements at odd indices are odd, the function returns `True`. The input list `lst` remains unchanged after the function execution. The function handles edge cases where the list is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns `True` without modifying the list. The function's postconditions are met, and it correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices in the input list.**
