According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since `lst` has at least 2 elements and `i` has been increased to 2, `lst` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
