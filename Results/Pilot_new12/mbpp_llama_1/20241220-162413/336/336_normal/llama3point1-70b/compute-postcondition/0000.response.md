According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list of integers, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `lst` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0.
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
