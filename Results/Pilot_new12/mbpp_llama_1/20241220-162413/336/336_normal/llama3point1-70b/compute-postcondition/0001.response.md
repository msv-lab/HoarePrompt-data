Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0. Given the current value of `i`, the value of `i` is even because `i` equals 0. The current value of `i` is used to index `lst`. The element at index `i` of `lst` is even. The condition of `i` being odd is not met because `i` equals 0, however, since this is part of the if condition the odd condition of `i` is not satisfied but since `i` is 0 this will always be false. So we only care about `lst[i]` which is even.**
