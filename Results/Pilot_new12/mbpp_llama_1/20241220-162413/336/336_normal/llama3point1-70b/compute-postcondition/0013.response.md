Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements at odd indices in the list have odd values. The function does not modify the input list and only examines the parity of elements at odd indices. It returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even value at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices. The function's return value is solely determined by the parity of elements at odd indices, and it does not consider the parity of elements at even indices.**
