To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to understand both the problem statement and how the program operates.

The problem description requires writing a Python function to check whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.

The annotated program provided defines a function `func_1` that iterates through a list `lst`. For every index `i` in the list, it checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an odd index with an even value, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding such a case, it returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd values.

Let's analyze this against the problem description:

1. **Iterating through the list and checking indices:** The program correctly identifies odd indices by using the condition `i % 2!= 0`.
2. **Checking for odd values at odd indices:** It checks if a value is odd by ensuring `lst[i] % 2!= 0`. However, in the context of the function, it actually checks for the opposite condition (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`) and returns `False` if an even value is found at an odd index, which is a correct approach to verify the problem statement indirectly.
3. **Returning `True` or `False` based on the condition:** The program returns `True` only if no odd index with an even value is found, which aligns with the requirement to verify if every odd index contains an odd number.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and it correctly identifies whether all odd indices in the list have odd values without modifying the input list.

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct because it strictly follows the problem description's requirements:
- It checks every odd index in the list.
- It verifies if the value at each odd index is odd (indirectly by checking for even values and returning `False` if found).
- It returns `True` if all odd indices have odd values and `False` otherwise.
Thus, for every potential valid input (assuming valid inputs as per the problem statement), the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.
