Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks two conditions: 

1. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`), 
2. If the value at the index `i` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are met, it immediately returns `False` because an odd index should contain an odd number, not an even number. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Lists with all odd indices containing odd numbers
- Lists with at least one odd index containing an even number
- Empty lists (in which case it will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check)
- Lists with only one element (if the index is odd, it checks the number; if the index is even, it doesn't affect the result)

The function's logic is sound, and it does not have any missing edge cases that it does not handle according to the problem description.
