Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks two conditions: if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list does not meet the condition. If the loop completes without finding any even values at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential issues. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices. It does not modify the input list and only examines the parity of elements at odd indices, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the code correctly checks every odd index for an odd value and handles all potential cases as described in the problem, the correctness is **True**.
