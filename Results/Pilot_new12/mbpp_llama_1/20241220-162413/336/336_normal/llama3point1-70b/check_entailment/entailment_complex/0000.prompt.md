You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` remains unchanged as a list of integers, `i` equals `len(lst) - 1` if the loop completes without returning `False`, and the function returns `False` if an odd index in `lst` has an even value; otherwise, no changes are made, and the function does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list 'lst' have odd values and 'i' equals the last index of 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements at odd indices in the list have odd values. The function does not modify the input list and only examines the parity of elements at odd indices. It returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even value at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices. The function's return value is solely determined by the parity of elements at odd indices, and it does not consider the parity of elements at even indices.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
