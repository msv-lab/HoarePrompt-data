Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements the function as described in the problem description. It checks whether every odd index in the input list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list, checking each index `i` (with `i` being 0-indexed) to see if it is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all indices without finding any even values at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The code correctly handles lists of any length, including empty lists, because the `for` loop simply doesn't execute if the list is empty, resulting in the function returning `True`, which aligns with the expectation since there are no elements at odd indices to begin with.

The function's behavior, as described in the output hints, matches the code's implementation. It examines the parity of elements at odd indices, returns `False` upon finding an even value at an odd index, and returns `True` otherwise, without considering the parity of elements at even indices. This matches the problem description's requirement for checking odd indices for odd values.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers), the provided code correctly implements the described functionality for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the code is correct according to the given problem description and constraints.
