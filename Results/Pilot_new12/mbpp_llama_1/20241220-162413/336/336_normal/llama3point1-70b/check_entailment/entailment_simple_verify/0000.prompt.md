You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks each index `i` to see if it is odd (i.e., `i % 2!= 0`). If the index is odd, it then checks if the value at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an odd index with an even value, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such cases, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This function handles all potential cases correctly. It checks every index in the list, and for each odd index, it checks the value to ensure it is odd. The function also handles lists of different lengths and compositions without error. It correctly returns `False` for lists where an odd index contains an even number and `True` for lists where every odd index contains an odd number.

For example, given the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `True` because every odd index (1, 3) contains an odd number (3, 7). Given the list `[1, 4, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `False` because the odd index 1 contains the even number 4.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` remains unchanged as a list of integers, `i` equals `len(lst) - 1` if the loop completes without returning `False`, and the function returns `False` if an odd index in `lst` has an even value; otherwise, no changes are made, and the function does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list 'lst' have odd values and 'i' equals the last index of 'lst'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
