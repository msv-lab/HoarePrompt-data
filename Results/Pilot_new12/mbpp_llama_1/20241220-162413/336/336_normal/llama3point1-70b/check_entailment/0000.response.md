Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks each index `i` to see if it is odd (i.e., `i % 2!= 0`). If the index is odd, it then checks if the value at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an odd index with an even value, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such cases, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This function handles all potential cases correctly. It checks every index in the list, and for each odd index, it checks the value to ensure it is odd. The function also handles lists of different lengths and compositions without error. It correctly returns `False` for lists where an odd index contains an even number and `True` for lists where every odd index contains an odd number.

For example, given the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `True` because every odd index (1, 3) contains an odd number (3, 7). Given the list `[1, 4, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `False` because the odd index 1 contains the even number 4.
