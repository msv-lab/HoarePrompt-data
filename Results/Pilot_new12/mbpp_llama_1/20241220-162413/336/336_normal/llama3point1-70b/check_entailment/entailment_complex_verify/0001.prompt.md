You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks two conditions: 

1. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`), 
2. If the value at the index `i` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are met, it immediately returns `False` because an odd index should contain an odd number, not an even number. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This function correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Lists with all odd indices containing odd numbers
- Lists with at least one odd index containing an even number
- Empty lists (in which case it will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check)
- Lists with only one element (if the index is odd, it checks the number; if the index is even, it doesn't affect the result)

The function's logic is sound, and it does not have any missing edge cases that it does not handle according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` remains unchanged as a list of integers, `i` equals `len(lst) - 1` if the loop completes without returning `False`, and the function returns `False` if an odd index in `lst` has an even value; otherwise, no changes are made, and the function does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list 'lst' have odd values and 'i' equals the last index of 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements at odd indices in the list have odd values. The function does not modify the input list and only examines the parity of elements at odd indices. It returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even value at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices. The function's return value is solely determined by the parity of elements at odd indices, and it does not consider the parity of elements at even indices.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
