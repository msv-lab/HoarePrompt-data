To verify the correctness of the provided Python function, we need to ensure it checks whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers, as stated in the problem description.

The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through each index `i` in the list `lst`. For each index, it checks two conditions:
1. If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2!= 0`).
2. If the value at the odd index `i` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are true (i.e., an odd index contains an even number), the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any odd index with an even value, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices in the list contain odd numbers.

Given this logic, the function correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It does not modify the input list and only returns a boolean value based on the condition check.

Therefore, the function is correct because it:
- Iterates through all indices of the list.
- Checks if each odd index contains an odd number.
- Returns `False` as soon as it finds an odd index with an even number.
- Returns `True` if it checks all odd indices and finds them to contain odd numbers.

Correctness: **True**
