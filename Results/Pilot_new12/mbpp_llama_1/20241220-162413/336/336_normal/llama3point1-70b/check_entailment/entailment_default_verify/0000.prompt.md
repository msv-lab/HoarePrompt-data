You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks each index `i` to see if it is odd (i.e., `i % 2!= 0`). If the index is odd, it then checks if the value at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an odd index with an even value, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such cases, it returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This function handles all potential cases correctly. It checks every index in the list, and for each odd index, it checks the value to ensure it is odd. The function also handles lists of different lengths and compositions without error. It correctly returns `False` for lists where an odd index contains an even number and `True` for lists where every odd index contains an odd number.

For example, given the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `True` because every odd index (1, 3) contains an odd number (3, 7). Given the list `[1, 4, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `False` because the odd index 1 contains the even number 4.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements at odd indices in the list have odd values. The function does not modify the input list and only examines the parity of elements at odd indices. It returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even value at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices. The function's return value is solely determined by the parity of elements at odd indices, and it does not consider the parity of elements at even indices.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
