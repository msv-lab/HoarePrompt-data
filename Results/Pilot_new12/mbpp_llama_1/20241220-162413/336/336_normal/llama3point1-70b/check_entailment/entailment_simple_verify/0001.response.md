To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code, let's analyze the key components:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.
2. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the function `func_1` correctly fulfills this task. It explains that the function iterates over the list, checking if any odd index contains an even number. If such a condition is met, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all indices.
3. **Annotated Version of the Code**: The annotations provided confirm the original assessment's understanding of the function's behavior. They indicate that the function iterates through the list, and if it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such a condition, it returns `True`, with the list remaining unchanged.

Given these points, the original assessment accurately reflects the behavior of the function as described in the problem and annotated version. The function correctly handles the requirement to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number, returning `True` if this condition is met and `False` otherwise.

The reasons for maintaining the original assessment are:
- The function's logic is sound and correctly checks for the condition specified in the problem description.
- The annotated version supports the original assessment's understanding of how the function operates.
- The function handles edge cases appropriately, such as empty lists and lists with a single element, as described in the original assessment.

**Final: True**
