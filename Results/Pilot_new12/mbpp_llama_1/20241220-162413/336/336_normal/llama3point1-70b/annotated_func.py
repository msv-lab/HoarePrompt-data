#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` remains unchanged as a list of integers, `i` equals `len(lst) - 1` if the loop completes without returning `False`, and the function returns `False` if an odd index in `lst` has an even value; otherwise, no changes are made, and the function does not return `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all odd indices in the list 'lst' have odd values and 'i' equals the last index of 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements at odd indices in the list have odd values. The function does not modify the input list and only examines the parity of elements at odd indices. It returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even value at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. The function handles lists of any length, including empty lists, and correctly identifies the parity of elements at odd indices. The function's return value is solely determined by the parity of elements at odd indices, and it does not consider the parity of elements at even indices.
