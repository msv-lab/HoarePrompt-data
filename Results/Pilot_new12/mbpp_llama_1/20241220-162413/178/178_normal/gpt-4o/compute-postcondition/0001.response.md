The code `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)` calculates the sum of all integers in the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. 

Given that `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding number in `numbers`, the sum of `rounded_numbers` will be the sum of these rounded integers.

The states of `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding number in `numbers`, and `total_sum` is the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding number in `numbers`, `total_sum` is equal to `sum(rounded_numbers)`**
