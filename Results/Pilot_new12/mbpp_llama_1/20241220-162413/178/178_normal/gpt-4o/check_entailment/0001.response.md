Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number in the list using the `round` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. The result is returned by the function.

Upon examining the code, it correctly follows the problem description. The logic is straightforward and handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as integers and floating-point numbers, correctly. The use of a list comprehension to round the numbers is efficient, and the `sum` function accurately calculates the total of these rounded numbers. Finally, multiplying this sum by the length of the input list (obtained via `len(numbers)`) meets the problem's requirement.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, including lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers, integers, and floating-point numbers. Given the simplicity and directness of the code, along with its alignment with the problem description and the passing unit tests, there is no apparent case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
