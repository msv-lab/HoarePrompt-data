Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program follows the problem description:

1. The problem description asks to round every number of a given list of numbers. This is achieved by the line `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]`, which uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list `numbers`.

2. The problem description then asks to print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. Although the problem description says to "print" the result, the unit tests provided suggest that the function should return the result instead. In the given program, this is achieved by calculating the `total_sum` of the rounded numbers using the `sum` function and then multiplying it by the length of the list `numbers` to get the `result`.

3. The `result` is then returned by the function.

The program correctly handles the task as described in the problem description for every potential case, assuming the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. The unit tests provided also confirm that the program behaves correctly for different inputs. 

The only potential discrepancy is that the problem description asks to "print" the result, while the program returns it instead. However, based on the unit tests provided, it seems that the intention is for the function to return the result rather than printing it. If the function is expected to print the result, it would need to be modified to use `print(result)` instead of `return result`. But based on the unit tests, the current implementation is correct.
