Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It rounds every number in the given list of numbers, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The code handles this process correctly for all potential cases, as long as the input is a non-empty list of numbers. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs. 

The output hints provide a clear understanding of the function's behavior, including its handling of an empty list, which would result in a product of 0 due to the sum being 0 and the length being 0. However, as per the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list of numbers), this edge case does not affect the correctness of the code under the specified conditions. 

In every tested case, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description, which supports the conclusion that the code is correct for all valid inputs.
