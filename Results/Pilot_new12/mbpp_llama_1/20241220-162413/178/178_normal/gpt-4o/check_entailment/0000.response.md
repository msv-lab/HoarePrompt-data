Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the total sum multiplied by the length of the input list.

The function uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list, and the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers. The result is then calculated by multiplying the total sum by the length of the input list, which is obtained using the `len` function.

The function appears to correctly implement the problem description. The unit tests provided also pass with the expected results, indicating that the function behaves as expected for at least some input cases.

To verify the correctness of the function further, let's consider some edge cases:

1. Empty list: If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is the expected result since the sum of an empty list is 0 and the length of an empty list is 0.
2. List with single element: If the input list contains only one element, the function will return the rounded value of that element multiplied by 1, which is the expected result.
3. List with negative numbers: If the input list contains negative numbers, the function will correctly round them and calculate the total sum and result.
4. List with floating-point numbers: If the input list contains floating-point numbers, the function will correctly round them to the nearest integer and calculate the total sum and result.

In all the cases considered, the function appears to behave as expected according to the problem description. Since we can't find a case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
