Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list.

The code uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this operation. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of the rounded numbers, and this sum is multiplied by the length of the input list to produce the final result.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior, such as its handling of empty input lists and non-numeric values. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different input cases. Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases as expected.
