You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number in the list using the `round` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. The result is returned by the function.

Upon examining the code, it correctly follows the problem description. The logic is straightforward and handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as integers and floating-point numbers, correctly. The use of a list comprehension to round the numbers is efficient, and the `sum` function accurately calculates the total of these rounded numbers. Finally, multiplying this sum by the length of the input list (obtained via `len(numbers)`) meets the problem's requirement.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs, including lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers, integers, and floating-point numbers. Given the simplicity and directness of the code, along with its alignment with the problem description and the passing unit tests, there is no apparent case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the list. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and the length of an empty list is also 0, resulting in a product of 0. The function does not modify the original list of numbers and does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single numeric value, which is the calculated product, without altering the input list or the program's state beyond this calculation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
