#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the list. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and the length of an empty list is also 0, resulting in a product of 0. The function does not modify the original list of numbers and does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single numeric value, which is the calculated product, without altering the input list or the program's state beyond this calculation.
