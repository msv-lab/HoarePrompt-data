To calculate the result, we first need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet is `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`. This line of code calculates the sum of all elements in the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns this sum to the `total_sum` variable.

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of numbers.
- `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding number in `numbers`.

After executing the code:
- The value of `numbers` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The value of `rounded_numbers` also remains unchanged for the same reason.
- A new variable `total_sum` is introduced, which is the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged lists `numbers` and `rounded_numbers`, along with the new variable `total_sum`, which equals the sum of the rounded numbers.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding number in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
