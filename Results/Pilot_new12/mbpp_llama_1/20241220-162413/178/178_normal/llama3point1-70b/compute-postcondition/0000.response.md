To calculate the result, we need to consider the effect of the code on the program and check the previous values of the affected variables.

The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` by iterating over each number `num` in the `numbers` list and rounding it to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.

The initial state is that `numbers` is a list of numbers. After executing the code, `numbers` remains unchanged, but a new list `rounded_numbers` is created. The values in `rounded_numbers` are the rounded versions of the corresponding values in `numbers`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded numbers where each number is equal to `round(num)` for the corresponding `num` in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the rounded value of the corresponding number in `numbers`**
