You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list.

The program correctly implements this functionality. Here's why:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.
2. **Calculating Sum**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` expression calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplying by Length**: The `total_sum * len(numbers)` expression correctly multiplies the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the input list.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, and the function will return 0, which is the correct result.
* Lists with negative numbers: The `round` function works correctly with negative numbers.
* Lists with floating-point numbers: The `round` function rounds floating-point numbers to the nearest integer.

Since the program correctly implements the specified functionality for all potential cases, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded integers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the input list. This operation is performed for all possible input lists, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with negative numbers, and lists with non-integer numbers. In the case of an empty list, the function will return 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of 0 with any number is 0. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric values, which may result in errors. The final state of the program after it concludes is the return of the calculated product, without modifying the original input list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
