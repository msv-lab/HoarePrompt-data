You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of the sum of all rounded integers in `rounded_numbers` and the total count of numbers in the `numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded integers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the input list. This operation is performed for all possible input lists, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with negative numbers, and lists with non-integer numbers. In the case of an empty list, the function will return 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of 0 with any number is 0. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric values, which may result in errors. The final state of the program after it concludes is the return of the calculated product, without modifying the original input list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
