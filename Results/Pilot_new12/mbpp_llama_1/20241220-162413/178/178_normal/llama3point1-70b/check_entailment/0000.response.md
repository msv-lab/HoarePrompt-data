Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list.

The program correctly implements this functionality. Here's why:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.
2. **Calculating Sum**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` expression calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplying by Length**: The `total_sum * len(numbers)` expression correctly multiplies the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the input list.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty lists: If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, and the function will return 0, which is the correct result.
* Lists with negative numbers: The `round` function works correctly with negative numbers.
* Lists with floating-point numbers: The `round` function rounds floating-point numbers to the nearest integer.

Since the program correctly implements the specified functionality for all potential cases, it is correct.
