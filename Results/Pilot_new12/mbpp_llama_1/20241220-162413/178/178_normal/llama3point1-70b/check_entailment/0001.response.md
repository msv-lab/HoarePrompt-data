Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct according to the provided problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer using the `round` function, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the total sum multiplied by the length of the input list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.
2. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers, which is mathematically correct.
3. The `len` function is used to get the length of the input list, which is then multiplied by the total sum.

The program handles various cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: If the input list is empty, the `sum` function will return 0, and the `len` function will return 0, resulting in a final output of 0 * 0 = 0, which is mathematically correct.
* Lists with single elements: If the input list contains only one element, the program will round the number, calculate the sum (which will be the rounded number itself), and then multiply it by 1 (the length of the list), resulting in the original rounded number.
* Lists with multiple elements: The program correctly rounds each number, calculates the sum, and then multiplies it by the length of the list, which is the expected behavior.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly, and no counterexamples can be found, the program is considered correct.
