#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of the sum of all rounded integers in `rounded_numbers` and the total count of numbers in the `numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded integers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers in the input list. This operation is performed for all possible input lists, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with negative numbers, and lists with non-integer numbers. In the case of an empty list, the function will return 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of 0 with any number is 0. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-numeric values, which may result in errors. The final state of the program after it concludes is the return of the calculated product, without modifying the original input list.
