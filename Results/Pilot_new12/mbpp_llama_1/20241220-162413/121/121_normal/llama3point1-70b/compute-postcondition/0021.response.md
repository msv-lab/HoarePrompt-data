Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 8. If `num` % 6 is in [1, 5], then if `count` equals `n`, the program returns 8, otherwise, the state of `count`, `n`, and `num` remains as is after the increment of `count`. If `num` % 6 is not in [1, 5], then the state of `n` and `num` remains unchanged.***
