To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

Initially, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 8. The condition checks if `num` % 6 is in [1, 5]. Since `num` is 8, `num` % 6 equals 2, which is not in [1, 5].

The code `num += 1` increments `num` by 1, making `num` equal to 9.

Now, since `num` is 9, `num` % 6 equals 3, which is in [1, 5]. However, this change does not affect the past conditions but will be relevant for any future checks.

The states of `n` and the condition related to `count` and `n` are not directly affected by the increment of `num`. The new state of `num` is 9.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 9. If `num` % 6 is in [1, 5], then the condition regarding `count` and `n` could be relevant, but since `count` is not defined in the initial state, its state remains undefined. However, given `num` is now 9, `num` % 6 equals 3, which is in [1, 5], so if `count` equals `n`, the program would return 8 based on the initial conditions, but this is speculative without knowing the current state of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 9**
