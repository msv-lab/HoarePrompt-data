Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is equal to `n` and equals 2, the current value of `num` is 7, the function `func_1` returns `True` for the current value of `num`, and the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, implying that `n` is also equal to 2 since `count` equals `n`**
