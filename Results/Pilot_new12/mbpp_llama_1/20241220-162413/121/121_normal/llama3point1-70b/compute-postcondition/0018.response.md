The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 8, and `count` is increased by 1. However, the return statement only concerns `num`. 

Given that `num` is 8, we are not provided with any further operations that modify `num` before it is returned.

Output State: **The program returns 8**
