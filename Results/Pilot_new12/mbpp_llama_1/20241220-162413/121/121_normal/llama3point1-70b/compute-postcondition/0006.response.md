According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute as long as the program is running. There are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute, so no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7**
