The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so `num` becomes 8. The state of `n` remains unchanged. Since `func_1(num)`'s return value is not provided and `num` was initially 7, we consider the initial conditions for `count`. When `num` was 7, the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 1. Given `func_1(num)` returns `True`, `count` was 2 and `count` was not equal to `n`. Now, with `num` being 8, the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is 2, which does not satisfy the condition of being 1 or 5. However, we must consider the initial state's conditions after the increment. Since the remainder is now 2, and `func_1(num)`'s return value for `num = 8` is unknown, we cannot directly apply the previous conditions for `count` being 2 or 1 based on `num`'s new value. The conditions for `count` were based on `num`'s value before the increment. Thus, considering `num` has changed but without explicit conditions for `num = 8` regarding `func_1(num)` and its impact on `count`, and acknowledging the increment of `num`, we look at what has directly changed: `num` is now 8.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 8, and the previous conditions regarding `count` and its relation to `n` and `func_1(num)` for `num = 7` no longer directly apply due to the increment of `num`.**
