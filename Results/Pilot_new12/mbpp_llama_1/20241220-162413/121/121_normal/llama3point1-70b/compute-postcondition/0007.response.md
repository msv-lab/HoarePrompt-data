To determine the postcondition, we need to consider the precondition and the if condition. The precondition states that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 1, and `num` is 7. The if condition is `if (func_1(num))`, which implies that the function `func_1` returns `True` for the given `num`.

Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7, and the function `func_1` returns `True` for the current value of `num`**
