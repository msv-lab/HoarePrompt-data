According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Since there are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute again, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 8**
