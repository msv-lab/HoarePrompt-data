To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the given code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop continues indefinitely (`while True`) until it encounters a `return` statement. The `return` statement is executed when `count` equals `n` and the current `num` satisfies the conditions `func_1(num)` and `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.

1. **`n`**: Remains unchanged throughout the loop as it's not modified within the loop. It's a condition variable that determines when to stop the loop.

2. **`count`**: Starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time `num` satisfies `func_1(num)` and `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. The loop stops (via `return`) when `count` equals `n`.

3. **`num`**: Starts at 7 and increments by 1 at the end of each iteration. The final value of `num` that makes `count` equal to `n` (and satisfies the other conditions) will be the return value, but we're interested in the state after the loop, which means we're looking at the values of variables if the loop were to hypothetically continue. However, given the loop stops with a `return`, we actually consider the state at the point of return for `count` and `num`.

Given the loop stops with `return num` when `count == n`, after the loop has finished executing (or more accurately, after it has returned), we know:
- `count` will be equal to `n` because that's the condition under which the loop returns.
- `num` will be the value that caused `count` to equal `n` and also satisfies `func_1(num)` and `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.

Considering these points, the output state after the loop has finished executing is characterized by:
- `count` equals the original value of `n`.
- `num` is the specific value that led to `count` equaling `n`, which depends on `func_1(num)` and the modulo condition.
- `n` retains its original value.

Output State: **`count` equals the original value of `n`, `num` is the value that satisfied the conditions leading to `count` equaling `n`, `n` remains unchanged as the original positive integer greater than 1.**
