The code increments `num` by 1. The initial state of `num` is 9. 

Therefore, `num` becomes 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 10. If `func_1(num)` is true and `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5, then if `count` equals `n`, the program returns 9, otherwise, the state of `count`, `n`, and `num` remains with `count` increased by 1. If `func_1(num)` is false, then the state of `n` and `num` remains unchanged since there is no else part in the code.**
