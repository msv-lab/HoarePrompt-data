Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is 7, and the function `func_1` returns `True` for the current value of `num`. If the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is either 1 or 5, then `count` is 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. If the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is not 1 or 5, then the state of `count` and `n` remains unchanged.***
