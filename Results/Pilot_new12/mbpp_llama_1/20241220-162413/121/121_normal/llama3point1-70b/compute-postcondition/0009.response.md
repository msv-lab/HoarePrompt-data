The code increments the `count` variable by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, the current value of `num` is 7, the function `func_1` returns `True` for the current value of `num`, and the remainder of `num` divided by 6 is either 1 or 5**
