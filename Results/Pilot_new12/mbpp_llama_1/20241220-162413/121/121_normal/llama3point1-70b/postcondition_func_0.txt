The function determines whether a given integer `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number greater than 1 and `False` otherwise. The function handles integers less than 2 by immediately returning `False`, as these are not prime numbers by definition. For integers greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility up to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` is prime. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `False`, indicating `n` is a composite number. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`, confirming `n` is a prime number. The function's postconditions are met through its return values, accurately reflecting the primality of the input integer `n`.
