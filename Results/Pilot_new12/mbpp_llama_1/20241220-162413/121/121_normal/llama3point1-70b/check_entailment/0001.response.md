Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct. It consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The `func_1` function checks for primality correctly. It returns False for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

The `func_2` function correctly implements the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter whenever it finds a prime number that is 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. This is because all primes are of the form 6k Â± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3.

The program handles the base case where n is 1 correctly, returning 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that the program does not handle correctly. The use of a while loop in `func_2` ensures that the function will continue to check numbers until it finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and implements the required logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
