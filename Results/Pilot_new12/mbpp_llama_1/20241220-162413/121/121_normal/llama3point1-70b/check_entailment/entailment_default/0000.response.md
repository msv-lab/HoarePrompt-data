Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to be correct as it implements the necessary functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

Function `func_1` checks whether a given number is prime, and its output hints agree with the code. It handles integers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Function `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts from 7 and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that satisfies the condition (being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6). The function iterates until it finds the nth prime number that satisfies the condition and returns it.

The code handles the case where n is 1 by returning 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For n greater than 1, it correctly finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The output hints for both functions agree with the code, and the functions seem to be working as expected. The code does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, it appears that the program is correct and will work as expected for every potential case, assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.
