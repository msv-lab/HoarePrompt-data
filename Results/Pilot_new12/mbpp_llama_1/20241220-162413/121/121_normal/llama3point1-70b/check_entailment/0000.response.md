Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is a specific type of prime number that satisfies the condition of being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` uses this function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

`func_1` is a standard prime-checking function that returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

`func_2` starts with the number 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter whenever it finds a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. When the counter reaches the desired value `n`, it returns the corresponding prime number.

The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, returning 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. For other values of `n`, it correctly increments the counter and checks for the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime condition.

After analyzing the code, I could not find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The prime-checking function is correct, and the main function correctly implements the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The program handles the base case when `n` is 1 and correctly increments the counter for subsequent values of `n`. 

The code seems to cover all the edge cases such as negative numbers, numbers less than 7, and it correctly identifies the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

Therefore, based on my analysis, I believe that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
