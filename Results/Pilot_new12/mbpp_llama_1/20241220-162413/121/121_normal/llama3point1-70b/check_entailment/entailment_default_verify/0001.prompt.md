You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct. It consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The `func_1` function checks for primality correctly. It returns False for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

The `func_2` function correctly implements the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter whenever it finds a prime number that is 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. This is because all primes are of the form 6k ± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3.

The program handles the base case where n is 1 correctly, returning 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that the program does not handle correctly. The use of a while loop in `func_2` ensures that the function will continue to check numbers until it finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and implements the required logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 1 and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function returns a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that satisfies the condition, incrementing a counter until it reaches `n`. The function returns the nth prime number that satisfies the condition. Note that the function's return value is not limited to the integers 7, 8, or 9, as suggested by the annotations, but rather can be any prime number that satisfies the Newman-Shanks-Williams condition. The actual code does not consider the cases where the returned value is 8 or 9, as these are not prime numbers. The function's purpose is to find specific prime numbers based on the input `n`, and its final state includes the returned prime number and the unchanged input `n`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
