You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is a specific type of prime number that satisfies the condition of being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` uses this function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

`func_1` is a standard prime-checking function that returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

`func_2` starts with the number 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter whenever it finds a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. When the counter reaches the desired value `n`, it returns the corresponding prime number.

The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, returning 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. For other values of `n`, it correctly increments the counter and checks for the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime condition.

After analyzing the code, I could not find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. The prime-checking function is correct, and the main function correctly implements the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The program handles the base case when `n` is 1 and correctly increments the counter for subsequent values of `n`. 

The code seems to cover all the edge cases such as negative numbers, numbers less than 7, and it correctly identifies the Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

Therefore, based on my analysis, I believe that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and if the loop completes without returning False, `n` is a prime number greater than 1, with `i` being the square root of `n` or the last number checked for divisibility. If the loop returns False, `n` is a composite number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating `n` is a prime number greater than 1

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 1, which implies that `n` is greater than 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` equals the original value of `n`, `num` is the value that satisfied the conditions leading to `count` equaling `n`, `n` remains unchanged as the original positive integer greater than 1.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
