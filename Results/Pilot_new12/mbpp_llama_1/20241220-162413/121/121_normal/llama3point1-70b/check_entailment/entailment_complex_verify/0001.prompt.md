You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct. It consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The `func_1` function checks for primality correctly. It returns False for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

The `func_2` function correctly implements the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime) and increments a counter whenever it finds a prime number that is 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. This is because all primes are of the form 6k ± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3.

The program handles the base case where n is 1 correctly, returning 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that the program does not handle correctly. The use of a while loop in `func_2` ensures that the function will continue to check numbers until it finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and implements the required logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and if the loop completes without returning False, `n` is a prime number greater than 1, with `i` being the square root of `n` or the last number checked for divisibility. If the loop returns False, `n` is a composite number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating `n` is a prime number greater than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given integer `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number greater than 1 and `False` otherwise. The function handles integers less than 2 by immediately returning `False`, as these are not prime numbers by definition. For integers greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility up to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` is prime. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `False`, indicating `n` is a composite number. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`, confirming `n` is a prime number. The function's postconditions are met through its return values, accurately reflecting the primality of the input integer `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 1, which implies that `n` is greater than 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` equals the original value of `n`, `num` is the value that satisfied the conditions leading to `count` equaling `n`, `n` remains unchanged as the original positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 1 and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function returns a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that satisfies the condition, incrementing a counter until it reaches `n`. The function returns the nth prime number that satisfies the condition. Note that the function's return value is not limited to the integers 7, 8, or 9, as suggested by the annotations, but rather can be any prime number that satisfies the Newman-Shanks-Williams condition. The actual code does not consider the cases where the returned value is 8 or 9, as these are not prime numbers. The function's purpose is to find specific prime numbers based on the input `n`, and its final state includes the returned prime number and the unchanged input `n`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
