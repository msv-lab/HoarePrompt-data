Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct. It meets all the requirements mentioned in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are prime numbers that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The code correctly implements this definition. 

`func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` uses this function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

In `func_2`, if `n` is 1, the function returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For `n` greater than 1, the function iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that satisfies the condition, incrementing a counter until it reaches `n`. 

The function returns the nth prime number that satisfies the condition. The annotations provided are also consistent with the code and help to understand its functionality. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct and should work as expected for every potential case. 

The code does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle, and it follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the code is confirmed.
