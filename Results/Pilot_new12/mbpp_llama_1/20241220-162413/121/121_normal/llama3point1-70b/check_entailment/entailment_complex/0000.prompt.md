You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and if the loop completes without returning False, `n` is a prime number greater than 1, with `i` being the square root of `n` or the last number checked for divisibility. If the loop returns False, `n` is a composite number.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating `n` is a prime number greater than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given integer `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number greater than 1 and `False` otherwise. The function handles integers less than 2 by immediately returning `False`, as these are not prime numbers by definition. For integers greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility up to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` is prime. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it returns `False`, indicating `n` is a composite number. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`, confirming `n` is a prime number. The function's postconditions are met through its return values, accurately reflecting the primality of the input integer `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 1, which implies that `n` is greater than 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` equals the original value of `n`, `num` is the value that satisfied the conditions leading to `count` equaling `n`, `n` remains unchanged as the original positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 1 and returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. If `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For `n` greater than 1, the function returns a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The function iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that satisfies the condition, incrementing a counter until it reaches `n`. The function returns the nth prime number that satisfies the condition. Note that the function's return value is not limited to the integers 7, 8, or 9, as suggested by the annotations, but rather can be any prime number that satisfies the Newman-Shanks-Williams condition. The actual code does not consider the cases where the returned value is 8 or 9, as these are not prime numbers. The function's purpose is to find specific prime numbers based on the input `n`, and its final state includes the returned prime number and the unchanged input `n`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
