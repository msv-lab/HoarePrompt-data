Correctness: **True**

The code provided appears to correctly implement the function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` uses this helper function to find the nth prime number that satisfies the condition of being congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

The code handles the base case where `n` is 1 by immediately returning 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For `n` greater than 1, it iterates through numbers starting from 7 and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that satisfies the condition, incrementing a counter until it reaches `n`. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The output hints agree with the code, and no edge cases or potential issues are apparent. The program assumes that the input will be a valid positive integer, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs. It correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number and handles the base case and iterative case correctly.
