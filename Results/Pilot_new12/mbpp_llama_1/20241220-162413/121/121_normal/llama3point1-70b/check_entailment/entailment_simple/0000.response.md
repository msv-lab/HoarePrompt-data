Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the problem description because it successfully implements the functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  **Understanding Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime Numbers:** Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers of the form 6k ± 1, starting with 7. This sequence is crucial because all primes are of the form 6k ± 1, for k = 1, 2,..., with the exception of 2 and 3.
2.  **Implementation of Prime Checking (func_1):** The `func_1` function checks whether a given number `n` is prime. It does this efficiently by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`, which is a well-known optimization in prime number checks. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
3.  **Finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime (func_2):** The `func_2` function is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with the first prime of this form, which is 7. It then checks each subsequent number to see if it is prime (using `func_1`) and of the form 6k ± 1. It increments a counter each time it finds a number that satisfies both conditions until the counter equals `n`, at which point it returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
4.  **Handling the Base Case:** The function correctly handles the base case where `n = 1` by immediately returning 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
5.  **Iterative Search:** The use of a `while True` loop ensures that the function will continue to check numbers until it finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, regardless of how large `n` is.

Given that the program follows the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, checks for primality correctly, and iterates through numbers to find the nth prime of this specific form, it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases where the input is a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 1.
