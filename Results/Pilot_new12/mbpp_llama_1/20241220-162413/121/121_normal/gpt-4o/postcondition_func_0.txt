The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the `n`th term of the recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with initial values `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1` if `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The sequence is calculated iteratively, updating the terms `S0` and `S1` to compute the `n`th term. After execution, the function returns the calculated term, with no modifications to the input variable `n`. The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning 1 directly. For all other positive integers `n` greater than 1, it calculates and returns the corresponding term of the sequence.
