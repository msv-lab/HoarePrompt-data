Correctness: **False**.

The function in the given code does not appear to calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Instead, it calculates the nth term of a specific recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with initial values `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`. 

Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a specific sequence of prime numbers. However, the given code does not check for primality, it simply generates terms of the sequence.

For example, the function `func_1(2)` returns 3, which is indeed a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but the function `func_1(3)` returns 7, which is also a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but it's not clear that this function will always return the correct Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for every n. 

In fact, to verify that the nth term is a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, one would need to check if the term is a prime number and also verify that it is indeed the nth term in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

However, this code does not check for primality, it simply calculates a term of the sequence. Therefore, it's incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
