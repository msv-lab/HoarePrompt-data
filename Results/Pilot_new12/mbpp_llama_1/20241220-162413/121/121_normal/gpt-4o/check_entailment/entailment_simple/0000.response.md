Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but the provided function does not check for primality or generate prime numbers. 

Instead, it seems to be implementing a recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`. This sequence does generate some prime numbers, but it does not guarantee to generate the nth prime number in the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

A correct implementation would involve checking each term of the sequence for primality and keeping track of how many prime numbers have been found. The function should return the nth prime number found in the sequence, not just the nth term of the sequence. 

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function is expected to return specific prime numbers for certain inputs, but the function's current implementation does not guarantee this behavior for all inputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
