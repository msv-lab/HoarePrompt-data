Correctness: **False**

The code does not find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence is a sequence of prime numbers, and the given code calculates a term of a recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}`. This sequence is not related to prime numbers. The code provided does not check if the calculated numbers are prime, which is necessary to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. 

For example, when n is 3, the code returns 7 which is the 4th term of the sequence, but it does not check if 7 is a prime number. Also, the first few terms of the sequence are 1, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41,... and these terms do not necessarily correspond to prime numbers.

To correctly find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, the code should check if each term of the sequence is prime and return the nth prime number in the sequence. The provided code does not do this. 

Therefore, the code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case, making it incorrect.
