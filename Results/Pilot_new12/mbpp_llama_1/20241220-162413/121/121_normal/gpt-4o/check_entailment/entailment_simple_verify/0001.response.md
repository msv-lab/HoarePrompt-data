The original assessment states that the provided function `func_1(n)` does not correctly calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function calculates the nth term of a sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, but it does not confirm that this sequence consists of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a specific sequence of prime numbers, and the provided function does not check whether the calculated terms are prime numbers. Furthermore, the function's recurrence relation `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` does not guarantee the generation of prime numbers.

The original assessment provides a counterexample where `func_1(7)` returns `305`, which is not a prime number. This counterexample supports the conclusion that the function does not correctly calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
