Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1(n)` does not correctly calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Instead, it seems to be calculating the nth number in a recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2*S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}`, with initial values `S_0 = S_1 = 1`. 

This sequence does not produce prime numbers. For example, when `n = 6`, `func_1(6)` returns `113`, but when `n = 7`, `func_1(7)` returns `305`, which is not a prime number.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers defined by a specific recurrence relation, which involves calculating the next number as a combination of previous terms, not just a simple linear combination like in the provided function.

To correctly calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, a function would need to generate the sequence of prime numbers and check each number to see if it satisfies the recurrence relation. The provided function does not do this. 

Here is an example of a case when the program does not work correctly: `func_1(8)` returns `657`, but `657` is not the 8th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The actual 8th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is `239`.
