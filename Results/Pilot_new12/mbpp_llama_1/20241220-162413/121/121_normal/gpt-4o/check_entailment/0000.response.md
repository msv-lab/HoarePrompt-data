Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly implement the functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence is defined as S(0) = 7, S(1) = 17, and S(n+1) = 2*S(n) + S(n-1) for n > 0. However, the given code defines the sequence as S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1, and S(n+1) = 2*S(n) + S(n-1) for n > 0, which is not the correct definition of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence.

As a counterexample, consider the case when n = 0. The program returns 1, but the correct Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at position 0 is 7. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
