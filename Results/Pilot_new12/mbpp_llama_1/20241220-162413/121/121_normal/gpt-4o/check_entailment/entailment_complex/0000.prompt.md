You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is neither 0 nor 1, which implies that n is at least 2
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is the (n-1)th term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, `S1` is the nth term of the same sequence.
    return S1
    #The program returns the nth term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, where n is a positive integer and at least 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the `n`th term of the recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with initial values `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1` if `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The sequence is calculated iteratively, updating the terms `S0` and `S1` to compute the `n`th term. After execution, the function returns the calculated term, with no modifications to the input variable `n`. The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning 1 directly. For all other positive integers `n` greater than 1, it calculates and returns the corresponding term of the sequence.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
