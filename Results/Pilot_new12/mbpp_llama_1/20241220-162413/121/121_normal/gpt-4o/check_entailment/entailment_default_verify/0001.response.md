The original assessment states that the provided function `func_1(n)` does not correctly calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, this assessment is accurate.

The output hints indicate that the function calculates the nth term of a recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}`, which is not related to the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers defined by a specific recurrence relation, and the provided function does not implement this relation.

The function returns the calculated term of the sequence, but this term is not necessarily a prime number, and it does not follow the recurrence relation of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. For example, when `n = 6`, `func_1(6)` returns `113`, which is a prime number, but when `n = 7`, `func_1(7)` returns `305`, which is not a prime number.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the function does not calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

Final: **False**
