Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it does not calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Instead, it calculates the nth term of a recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with initial values `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that start with 7 and are defined by the recurrence relation `p_n = 2p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}^2`, not `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}`.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are: 7, 17, 41, 197,.... However, the sequence generated by the program starts with 1, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99,... which does not match the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(3) == 7` and `assert func_1(4) == 17` pass, but this is a coincidence and does not guarantee the correctness of the function for all inputs. The function does not actually calculate the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but rather a different sequence that happens to match the first few terms. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements defined in the problem description.
