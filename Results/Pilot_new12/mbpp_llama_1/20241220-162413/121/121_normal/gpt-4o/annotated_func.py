#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a positive integer, and n is neither 0 nor 1, which implies that n is at least 2
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is the (n-1)th term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, `S1` is the nth term of the same sequence.
    return S1
    #The program returns the nth term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, where n is a positive integer and at least 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the `n`th term of the recursive sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with initial values `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1` if `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The sequence is calculated iteratively, updating the terms `S0` and `S1` to compute the `n`th term. After execution, the function returns the calculated term, with no modifications to the input variable `n`. The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning 1 directly. For all other positive integers `n` greater than 1, it calculates and returns the corresponding term of the sequence.
