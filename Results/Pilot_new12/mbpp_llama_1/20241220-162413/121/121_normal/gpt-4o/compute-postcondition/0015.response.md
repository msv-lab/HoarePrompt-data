The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function returns a value based on the value of `n`. 
Case 1: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns `1`. 
Case 2: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns the nth term of a sequence defined by the formula `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}`, where `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`. 
This implies that Case 1 is met when n is 1 and Case 2 is met when n is at least 2.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `1` if `n` is `1`, or the nth term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` if `n` is at least `2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, returns 1 if n is 1, or the nth term of the sequence S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} if n is at least 2.**
