To determine the output state after running the given Python code snippet, let's analyze its impact step by step.

The given Python code is:
```python
S0, S1 = S1, S_next
```
This line of code simultaneously assigns the value of `S1` to `S0` and the value of `S_next` to `S1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 5
- `S0` is 3
- `S1` is 7
- `i` is 4
- `S_next` is 17

After executing the code:
- The value of `S0` becomes the value of `S1`, which is 7.
- The value of `S1` becomes the value of `S_next`, which is 17.
- The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 5
- `S0` is 7
- `S1` is 17
- `i` is 4
- `S_next` is 17

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 5, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
