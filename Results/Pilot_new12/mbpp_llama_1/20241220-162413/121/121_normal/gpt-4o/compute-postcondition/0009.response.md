The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. The previous values of `S0` and `S1` are 1 and 3. `S_next` is 7. After the swap, `S0` becomes 3 and `S1` becomes 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
