To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3.

The given code is: `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.

Now, we substitute the given values of `S1` and `S0` into the equation: `S_next = 2 * 3 + 1`.

Calculating the value: `S_next = 6 + 1 = 7`.

So, `S_next` is updated to 7. The values of `n`, `S0`, `S1`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 7**.
