To find the output state, we first examine the given initial state and the code snippet. The initial state provides values for `n`, `S0`, `S1`, `i`, and `S_next`. The code snippet updates the value of `S_next` based on `S1` and `S0`.

Given initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 5
- `S0` is 3
- `S1` is 7
- `i` is 4
- `S_next` is 7 (initially)

Code snippet:
```python
S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
```

Now, let's calculate the new value of `S_next`:
- `S1` is 7
- `S0` is 3
- Therefore, `S_next` becomes `2 * 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17`

So, `S_next` is updated to 17.

The states of `n`, `S0`, `S1`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet. Only `S_next` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 5, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
