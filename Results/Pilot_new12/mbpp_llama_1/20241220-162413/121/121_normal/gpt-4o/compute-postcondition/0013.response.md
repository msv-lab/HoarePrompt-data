To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after it executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
    S0, S1 = S1, S_next
```

From the given output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe that:
- `S0` and `S1` are updated in each iteration based on the previous values of `S0` and `S1`.
- The update rule is `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, and then `S0` and `S1` are updated to `S1` and `S_next`, respectively.
- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 2, and the number of executions depends on the value of `n`.

Given that the initial state is `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, we need to understand what `S0` and `S1` represent after all iterations. 

Since `S0` and `S1` are updated based on their previous values, and considering the formula `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, it suggests a relationship with sequences where each term is defined recursively, similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a different recurrence relation.

The key here is to recognize the pattern and how `S0` and `S1` evolve with each iteration. After the loop finishes, `S0` will hold the value that `S1` had before the last iteration, and `S1` will hold the value calculated in the last iteration using the recurrence relation.

If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if `n` were less than 2, but since `n` is at least 2, this scenario is not applicable within the given constraints), `S0` and `S1` would remain as they were initially, 1 and 1, respectively.

However, given `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute. The number of executions is directly related to `n`, and after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n`, indicating the loop has iterated `n-1` times (since it starts from 2).

The sequence generated by `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` is a specific type of recursive sequence. To find a general formula or to understand what `S0` and `S1` represent after all iterations, we need to consider the pattern of updates and how each term depends on the previous ones.

Given the formula and the initial conditions, it's clear that `S1` after the loop will hold a value that is part of a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, starting with `S0 = 1` and `S1 = 1`. 

This sequence can be related to a form of Fibonacci-like sequence but with a different multiplier (2 instead of 1) and the same additive term. Thus, `S1` after all iterations will hold the `(n)`th term of this specific sequence, and `S0` will hold the `(n-1)`th term.

The sequence terms can be described as part of a recursive sequence where each term `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}`, with initial conditions `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`. 

Thus, after all iterations, `S1` will be the `n`th term of this sequence, and `S0` will be the `(n-1)`th term.

Considering the format and the analysis:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is the (n-1)th term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, `S1` is the nth term of the same sequence.**
