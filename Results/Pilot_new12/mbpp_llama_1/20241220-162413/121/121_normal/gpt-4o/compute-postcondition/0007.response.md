According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3, since the range starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1`, excluding `n + 1` but including 2. The values of `S0`, `S1`, and `S_next` do not directly impact the loop's ability to execute but are part of the program state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `i` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
