To find the output state, we first need to understand the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with initial terms `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, we are looking to return `S1`, which is the nth term of this sequence.

Given the recursive nature of the sequence, we calculate each term based on the two preceding ones. The initial terms are `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`. 

Since `S0` is the (n-1)th term and `S1` is the nth term, and knowing the formula, we can infer that the sequence's terms depend on the two immediately preceding terms. However, the task specifically asks for the return value of `S1`, which, according to the initial state, is the nth term of the sequence.

Thus, without calculating each term explicitly (since the task does not require showing the intermediate steps but rather understanding the impact of the return statement), we recognize that `S1` represents the nth term in a sequence that grows according to the given recursive formula, starting from `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`.

Therefore, the output state directly relates to the value of the nth term in this specific sequence, which is defined by its recursive formula and initial conditions.

Output State: **The program returns the nth term of the sequence defined by `S_n = 2 * S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}` with `S_0 = 1` and `S_1 = 1`, where n is a positive integer and at least 2**
