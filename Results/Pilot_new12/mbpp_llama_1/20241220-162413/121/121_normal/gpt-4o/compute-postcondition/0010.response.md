To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`, which means `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 4.
- `S0` is 3.
- `S1` is 7.
- `i` is 3.
- `S_next` is 7.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`, since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to increment by 1, so `i` becomes 4. 

Since `n` is at least 4 and `i` is now 4, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 because the loop will stop when `i` equals `n + 1`. 

The values of `S0`, `S1`, and `S_next` do not directly influence the loop's execution condition, which depends solely on `i` and `n`. Therefore, their states remain as given for the context of the loop's continuation condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 5, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
