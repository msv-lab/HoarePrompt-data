The value of `S_next` is assigned the value of 2 times `S1` plus `S0`. Given that `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 1, `S_next` is equal to 2 * 1 + 1 = 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
