Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This approach ensures that the function returns the correct maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The problem description asks to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function does exactly that. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, which is the maximum possible difference between any two elements.

The function's logic can be broken down as follows:

1. Find the minimum value in the array using the built-in `min` function.
2. Find the maximum value in the array using the built-in `max` function.
3. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The function's implementation is straightforward and efficient, making it a correct solution to the problem.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's correctness by checking its output for different input arrays. The function's correctness is further supported by the fact that it returns the expected results for the given test cases.
