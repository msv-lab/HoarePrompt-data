Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two values, which represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly finds the minimum and maximum values in the array, and the difference between these two values is indeed the maximum difference between any two elements.

For example, if the input array is `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the function correctly calculates the minimum value as `1` and the maximum value as `5`, and returns the difference `4`, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The function also handles edge cases such as an array with duplicate elements or an array with only one element. In these cases, the function still correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements.

Overall, the function works correctly for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
