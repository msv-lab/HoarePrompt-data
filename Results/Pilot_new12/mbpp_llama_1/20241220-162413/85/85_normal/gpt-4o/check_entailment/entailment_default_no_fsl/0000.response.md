Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value to find the difference.

This approach works for all potential cases, as it simply finds the largest and smallest elements in the array and returns their difference. The function does not modify the input list and returns an integer, as required.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness, as they cover various cases, including arrays with both positive and negative numbers, and arrays of different lengths.

Additionally, the output hints agree with the code's behavior, stating that the function will return 0 if the list has only one element (since the maximum and minimum values will be the same), and that it will raise a ValueError if the input list is empty (which is the behavior of the `min` and `max` functions in Python). 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not actually handle the case where the input list is empty, as it will indeed raise a ValueError when trying to find the `min` or `max` of an empty list. But since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the function.
