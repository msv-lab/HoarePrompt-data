The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. 

The problem description asks for the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function `func_1` calculates this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This indeed gives the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, because the difference between the smallest and largest numbers will always be the greatest.

Therefore, the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
