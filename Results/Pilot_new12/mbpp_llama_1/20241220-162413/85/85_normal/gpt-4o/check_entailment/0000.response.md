Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

The code handles this task correctly by using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions in Python, which return the smallest and largest items in an iterable, respectively. The function then returns the difference between these two values, which is the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.

The unit tests provided also validate the functionality of the code for various inputs. For instance, in the first test case, the maximum difference between any two elements in the array `(2, 1, 5, 3)` is `5 - 1 = 4`, which is correctly returned by the function. Similarly, for the array `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`, and for `(3, 2, 1)`, it's `3 - 1 = 2`, both of which are correctly calculated by the function.

Given the logic and the tests, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including arrays with negative numbers, zero, or duplicate values, as the `min()` and `max()` functions will still identify the correct minimum and maximum values to calculate the maximum difference. Therefore, without a specific counterexample where the code fails to meet the problem description, the code is considered correct.
