You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two values, which represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly finds the minimum and maximum values in the array, and the difference between these two values is indeed the maximum difference between any two elements.

For example, if the input array is `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the function correctly calculates the minimum value as `1` and the maximum value as `5`, and returns the difference `4`, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The function also handles edge cases such as an array with duplicate elements or an array with only one element. In these cases, the function still correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements.

Overall, the function works correctly for all potential cases, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` with at least one element and returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. If the list has only one element, the function will return 0, since the maximum and minimum values will be the same. The function does not modify the input list. The return value will be an integer, representing the range of values in the input list. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError, since the min() and max() functions cannot be applied to an empty list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
