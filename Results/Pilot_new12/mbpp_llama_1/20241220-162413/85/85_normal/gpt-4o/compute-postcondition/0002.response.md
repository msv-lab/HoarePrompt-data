The code `max_diff = max_val - min_val` assigns the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` to `max_diff`. Since `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr` and `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, the value of `max_diff` will be the difference between the largest and smallest integers in `arr`. 

The states of `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val` are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val` - `min_val`**
