The code `max_val = max(arr)` assigns the maximum value in the list `arr` to the variable `max_val`. The initial state mentions that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`. The value of `min_val` and the list `arr` remain unchanged as the code only introduces a new variable `max_val`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`**
