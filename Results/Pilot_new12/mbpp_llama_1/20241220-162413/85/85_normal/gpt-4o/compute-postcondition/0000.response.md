The code assigns the minimum value from the list `arr` to the variable `min_val`. The list `arr` is still a list of integers with at least two elements. The value of `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`**
