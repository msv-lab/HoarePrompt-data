The function accepts a list of integers `arr` with at least one element and returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. If the list has only one element, the function will return 0, since the maximum and minimum values will be the same. The function does not modify the input list. The return value will be an integer, representing the range of values in the input list. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError, since the min() and max() functions cannot be applied to an empty list.
