Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum value in the array from the maximum value. This approach is correct because the maximum difference between two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

The function works correctly for various input cases, including:

- Arrays with positive and negative numbers
- Arrays with all positive or all negative numbers
- Arrays with duplicate maximum or minimum values
- Arrays with a single element (in which case the function will return 0, as there are no two different elements to find the difference between)
- Empty arrays (this case is not explicitly handled in the function, but it will raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the `max` or `min` of an empty sequence, which could be considered as an indication that the input array is invalid)

To fully handle the edge case of an empty array, additional error checking could be added to the function. However, based on the provided problem description, the function behaves as expected for all non-empty arrays. 

Example:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 4
print(func_1([5, 5, 5, 5]))  # Output: 0
print(func_1([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: 2
```
