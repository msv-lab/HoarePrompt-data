Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(arr)` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array, respectively, and then returns the difference between these two values.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be between the maximum and minimum elements. The function handles all potential cases, including:

* If the array contains only one element, `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will return the same value, resulting in a difference of 0, which is correct.
* If the array contains multiple elements, the function will correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements.
* If the array contains duplicate elements, the function will still correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements.

Overall, the function is concise and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem as described.
