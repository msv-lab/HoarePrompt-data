Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the smallest element (`min(arr)`) from the largest element (`max(arr)`). This is a valid approach since the maximum difference between any two elements in the array will always be between the maximum and minimum values. 

The program's correctness can be explained as follows:

1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values**: The `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` functions correctly identify the maximum and minimum values in the array.
2. **Calculating Difference**: Subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value (`max(arr) - min(arr)`) gives the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.
3. **Handling Array**: Since the problem assumes that the input array will always have at least two elements and will be a valid list of integers, the program does not need to handle edge cases such as empty lists or non-integer values.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
