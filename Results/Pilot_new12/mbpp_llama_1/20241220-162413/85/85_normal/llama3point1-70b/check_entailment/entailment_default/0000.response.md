Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1(arr)` returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list, which is the definition of the maximum difference between any two elements.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that it handles the case where the list has only one element, returning 0 as expected. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the input list and does not handle cases where the input is not a list or the list contains non-integer values. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, these cases do not affect the correctness of the code.

The code uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the list, which ensures that it works correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct for every potential case.
