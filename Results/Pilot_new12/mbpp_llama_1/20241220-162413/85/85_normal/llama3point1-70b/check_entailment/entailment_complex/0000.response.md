Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, which is equivalent to finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. 

The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the list using the built-in `max` and `min` functions. This approach ensures that the function will always return the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, as the maximum and minimum elements are guaranteed to have the largest difference.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements), the function will always work as expected and return the correct result. The problem description does not require the function to handle edge cases such as empty lists, lists with a single element, or lists containing non-integer values, so the function's behavior in these cases is not relevant to its correctness. 

In summary, the program is correct because it uses a straightforward and efficient approach to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the input array, and it always returns the correct result for valid input.
