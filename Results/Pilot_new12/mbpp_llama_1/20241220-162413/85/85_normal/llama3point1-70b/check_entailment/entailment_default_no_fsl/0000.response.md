Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it precisely follows the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the given array, which is exactly what the problem description requires. 

The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior, including the case where the list has only one element, in which case the function correctly returns 0. 

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list containing only integers) means that edge cases such as an empty list, a list containing non-integer values, or a non-list input are not considered, as per the instructions. 

Given this assumption and the provided code, there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the specified constraints.
