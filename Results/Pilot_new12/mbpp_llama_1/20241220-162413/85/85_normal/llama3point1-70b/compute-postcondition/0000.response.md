To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state is that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements. The code snippet is `return max(arr) - min(arr)`. 

Given that `arr` has at least two elements and they are integers, `max(arr)` will return the largest integer in the list, and `min(arr)` will return the smallest integer in the list. The difference between these two values, `max(arr) - min(arr)`, will give the range of values in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list 'arr'.**
