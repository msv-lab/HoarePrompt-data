The function accepts a list of integers with at least one element, calculates and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. If the list has only one element, the function will return 0, since the maximum and minimum values will be the same. The function does not modify the input list and does not handle cases where the input is not a list or the list contains non-integer values.
