Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to remove all whitespaces from a string, but the provided code only removes spaces (ASCII code 32) and does not handle other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs or newline characters. 

For example, if the input string is 'python\tprogram' (where '\t' is a tab character), the function will return 'python\tprogram', not 'pythonprogram'. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, specifically for strings containing tabs or newline characters. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**. The code should be modified to handle all types of whitespace characters, not just spaces. This can be achieved using the `replace()` method with other whitespace characters, or more conveniently, using the `str.translate()` method or regular expressions. However, in Python, a simpler way to remove all whitespace characters is to use the `str.replace()` method in combination with the `str.split()` and `str.join()` methods, or by using the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module, or by using a list comprehension with a conditional statement. But the most Pythonic way to remove all whitespace characters is to use the `str.translate()` method or the `str.replace()` method in combination with the `str.maketrans()` method. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to remove all whitespace characters:

```python
import re

def func_1(s):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', s)
```

Or, without using regular expressions:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join(s.split())
```

Or, using the `str.translate()` method:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return s.translate(str.maketrans('', '', ' \t\n\r\v\f'))
```
