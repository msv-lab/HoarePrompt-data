Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it only removes spaces (ASCII code 32) from the input string, but the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces. The term "whitespaces" includes not only spaces, but also other characters like tabs, newline characters, etc. The provided program, as described in the comments, does not handle these other types of whitespace characters.

For example, if the input string is 'python\tprogram' or 'python\nprogram', the function will not remove the tab or newline characters, and will return 'python\tprogram' or 'python\nprogram', respectively. This is not in line with the problem description, which asks to remove all whitespaces from the string.

To fix this, the function could use the `replace()` method for each type of whitespace character, or it could use a regular expression that matches all whitespace characters. Alternatively, it could use the `join()` method in combination with a generator expression that iterates over the characters in the string, skipping any whitespace characters. 

A simple way to fix this function to meet the problem description would be:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if not c.isspace())
```
