Correctness: **False**.

The code does not remove all types of whitespaces from the string, it only removes spaces (ASCII code 32). The problem description asks to remove all whitespaces, which includes other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (ASCII code 9), newline characters (ASCII code 10), and more. The code does not handle these cases and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description. For example, if the input string is "python\tprogram" (where "\t" is a tab character), the function will return "python\tprogram" instead of "pythonprogram".
