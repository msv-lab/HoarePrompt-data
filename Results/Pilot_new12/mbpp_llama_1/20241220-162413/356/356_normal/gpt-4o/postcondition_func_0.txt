The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, removes all spaces from the string, and returns the resulting string. The input string `s` is not modified in-place; instead, the function returns a new string with the spaces removed. This functionality applies to all possible input strings, including empty strings, strings with leading or trailing spaces, and strings with multiple consecutive spaces. If the input string is `None` or not a string, the function may raise a TypeError. The function does not handle any other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs or newline characters, and only removes spaces (ASCII code 32) from the input string.
