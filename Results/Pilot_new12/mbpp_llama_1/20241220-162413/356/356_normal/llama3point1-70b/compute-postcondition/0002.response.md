Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `input_str` and returns a new string where all spaces have been removed from the original input string. It handles all potential edge cases, including empty strings, strings with leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces, and strings without spaces. The function does not modify the original input string but returns a new string with the specified transformation. It does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a string. If the input is not a string, the function may throw an error or behave unexpectedly. After execution, the program's state is such that the original input string remains unchanged, and a new string without spaces is returned as the result.**
