Correctness: **False**.

The code is supposed to remove all whitespaces from a string, but the `replace()` method only removes spaces (i.e., ' '), not other types of whitespace characters such as tabs ('\t'), newlines ('\n'), or carriage returns ('\r'). Therefore, the code does not work correctly for strings that contain these other types of whitespace characters. For example, the string "Hello\tWorld" would not have the tab character removed by this function. 

To correctly remove all whitespace characters, the `replace()` method would need to be used in combination with other string methods, such as `strip()` or `split()`, or a regular expression could be used. Alternatively, the `str.translate()` method could be used to remove all whitespace characters in a single operation. 

For instance, a correct implementation could be:
```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.translate(str.maketrans('', '', ' \t\n\r'))
```
or
```python
import re
def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```
