Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description because it only removes spaces from the input string, whereas the problem description asks for the removal of all whitespaces. Whitespaces include not only spaces but also tabs, newline characters, and other characters that are considered whitespace in Unicode.

The `replace` method used in the program only replaces the specified character, in this case, the space character (' '). It does not account for other types of whitespaces. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential edge cases, such as strings containing tabs or newline characters.

For example, if the input string is "\tHello\nWorld\t", the program will return "\tHello\nWorld\t", which still contains whitespaces (tabs and a newline character). The correct output should be "HelloWorld". 

To meet the problem description, the program could use the `replace` method with each type of whitespace character, or it could use a regular expression to replace all occurrences of any whitespace character with an empty string. 

Here's an example of how the corrected program could look:

```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

This version of the program uses a regular expression to replace one or more occurrences of any whitespace character with an empty string, effectively removing all whitespaces from the input string.
