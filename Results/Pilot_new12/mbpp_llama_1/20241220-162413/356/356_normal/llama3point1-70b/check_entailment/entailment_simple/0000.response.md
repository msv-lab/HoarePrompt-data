Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input string `input_str` and returns a new string with all spaces removed from `input_str`.

The `replace` method in Python is used to replace a specified phrase with another specified phrase. In this case, it replaces all occurrences of a space (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing them. This approach correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string.

It does exactly what the problem description asks for: removing all spaces from a given string. Since we assume that the input will be valid (in this case, a string), the function will work as expected for every potential valid case. 

There are no cases where this function would not meet the problem description, assuming valid input. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description.
