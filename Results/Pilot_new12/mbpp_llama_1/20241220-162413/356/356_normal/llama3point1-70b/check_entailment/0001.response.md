Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should remove "all whitespaces" from a string, but the provided program only removes spaces (' '). This means that other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs ('\t'), newline characters ('\n'), and carriage returns ('\r'), are not removed by the program.

For example, if the input string is "Hello\tWorld", the program will return "Hello\tWorld", which still contains a tab character. Similarly, if the input string is "Hello\nWorld", the program will return "Hello\nWorld", which still contains a newline character. 

To correctly remove all whitespace characters from a string, the program should use a regular expression or a method that can handle all types of whitespace characters, such as the `str.translate()` method or the `str.replace()` method with all types of whitespace characters, or use the `str.split()` and `str.join()` methods. 

A correct implementation could be:

```python
import re

def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

or 

```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.translate(str.maketrans('', '', ' \t\r\n'))
```
