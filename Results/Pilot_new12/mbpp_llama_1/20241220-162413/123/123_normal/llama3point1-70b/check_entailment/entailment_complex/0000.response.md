Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple includes the first `L` elements of the original list `lst`, and the second list includes the remaining elements of `lst`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `L` is `0` (in which case the first list in the tuple is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`), when `L` equals `len(lst)` (in which case the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty), and any value of `L` between these extremes.

The use of list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) ensures that the function splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the value of `L`, without modifying the original list or its elements. This is also in line with the problem description.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or where `L` is not a non-negative integer. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
