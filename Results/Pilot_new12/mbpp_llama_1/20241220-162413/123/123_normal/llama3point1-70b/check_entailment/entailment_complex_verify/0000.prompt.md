You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` correctly splits a list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. This is achieved by using Python's list slicing feature, where `lst[:L]` returns the first `L` elements of the list and `lst[L:]` returns the remaining elements.

The function handles various potential cases correctly, including:

- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, it returns the original list as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element.
- When `L` is greater than the length of the list, it returns the entire list as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element.
- When `L` is 0, it returns an empty list as the first element of the tuple and the original list as the second element.
- When `L` is negative, Python's list slicing will treat `L` as a index from the end, so it will not raise an error but it will return the elements based on the negative index value.

However, it's worth noting that this function does not handle the case where `L` is not an integer. If `L` is a float or a non-numeric value, the function may raise an error or return unexpected results. But based on the problem description, it is assumed that `L` is an integer.

If the list is empty and `L` is 0, the function correctly returns two empty lists. 

In general, the function behaves as expected for all possible integer values of `L` and any list.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the first L elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` as parameters, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple includes the first `L` elements of the original list `lst`, and the second list includes the remaining elements of `lst`. This functionality covers all potential edge cases, including when `L` is `0` (in which case the first list in the tuple is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`), when `L` equals `len(lst)` (in which case the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty), and any value of `L` between these extremes. The function effectively splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the value of `L`, with no modification to the original list or its elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
