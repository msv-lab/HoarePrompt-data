Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` correctly splits a list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. This is achieved by using Python's list slicing feature, where `lst[:L]` returns the first `L` elements of the list and `lst[L:]` returns the remaining elements.

The function handles various potential cases correctly, including:

- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, it returns the original list as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element.
- When `L` is greater than the length of the list, it returns the entire list as the first element of the tuple and an empty list as the second element.
- When `L` is 0, it returns an empty list as the first element of the tuple and the original list as the second element.
- When `L` is negative, Python's list slicing will treat `L` as a index from the end, so it will not raise an error but it will return the elements based on the negative index value.

However, it's worth noting that this function does not handle the case where `L` is not an integer. If `L` is a float or a non-numeric value, the function may raise an error or return unexpected results. But based on the problem description, it is assumed that `L` is an integer.

If the list is empty and `L` is 0, the function correctly returns two empty lists. 

In general, the function behaves as expected for all possible integer values of `L` and any list.
