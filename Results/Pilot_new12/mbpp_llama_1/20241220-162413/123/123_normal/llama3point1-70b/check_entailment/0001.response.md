Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list and an integer `L` and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is `L`. It returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

Here's why the code works as expected:

1. The function uses Python's list slicing feature (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) to split the list into two parts.
2. The slicing operation correctly handles cases where `L` is less than or equal to the length of the list.
3. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, `lst[:L]` will simply return a copy of the original list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
4. The function correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or `L` being 0.

Since the program works as expected for all potential cases, and no edge cases are left unhandled, the correctness of the program is **True**.
