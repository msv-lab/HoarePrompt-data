Correctness: **True**

The code provided in the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list includes the first `L` elements of the original list `lst`, and the second list includes the remaining elements of `lst`. 

The function handles all edge cases, such as when `L` is `0`, when `L` equals `len(lst)`, and any value of `L` between these extremes. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional insight into the functionality, confirming that the function effectively splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the value of `L`, with no modification to the original list or its elements.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function is correct. It correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the provided integer `L`, covering all the possible scenarios as described in the problem description and the output hints.
