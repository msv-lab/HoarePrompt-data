You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the first L elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` as parameters, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple includes the first `L` elements of the original list `lst`, and the second list includes the remaining elements of `lst`. This functionality covers all potential edge cases, including when `L` is `0` (in which case the first list in the tuple is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`), when `L` equals `len(lst)` (in which case the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty), and any value of `L` between these extremes. The function effectively splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the value of `L`, with no modification to the original list or its elements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
