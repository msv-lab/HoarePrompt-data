The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and based on the provided output hints and the problem description, this assessment remains accurate.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` behaves as expected for all valid inputs, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. The function correctly splits the input list into two parts, with the first part containing the first `L` elements and the second part containing the remaining elements. The output hints also cover the edge cases where `L` is `0` or equals `len(lst)`, and these cases are handled correctly by the function.

The provided code is straightforward and effectively implements the required functionality. The use of list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) ensures that the input list is split correctly, and the resulting lists are returned as a tuple.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's behavior aligns with the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of **True** is maintained.

The only potential point of discussion could be the handling of cases where `L` is not an integer or is outside the range of `0` to `len(lst)`. However, as noted in the problem description and output hints, it is assumed that `L` is a non-negative integer and within the valid range for the list. Thus, under these assumptions, the program behaves correctly and the original assessment stands.

Final: **True**
