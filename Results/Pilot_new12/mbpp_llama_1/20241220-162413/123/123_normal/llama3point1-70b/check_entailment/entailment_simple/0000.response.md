The provided function, `func_1`, takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs. According to the problem description, it should split the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and return the resulting lists in a tuple.

Here's a breakdown of how `func_1` works:

1. It uses Python's list slicing feature to create two new lists: `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.
   - `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`.
   - `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`, starting from index `L` to the end of the list.

2. It returns a tuple containing these two lists.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`), `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description.

Here's why it's correct for every potential case within the valid input range:

- **Edge case 1:** If `L = 0`, then `lst[:L]` will be an empty list `[]`, and `lst[L:]` will be the original list `lst`. This correctly splits the list into two parts, with the first part having a length of `0` (as specified by `L`).

- **Edge case 2:** If `L = len(lst)`, then `lst[:L]` will be the original list `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will be an empty list `[]`. This also correctly splits the list into two parts, with the first part having a length equal to `L`, which is the length of the entire list in this case.

- **General case:** For any `L` such that `0 < L < len(lst)`, the function will correctly split the list into two non-empty parts, with the length of the first part being `L` and the length of the second part being `len(lst) - L`.

Since `func_1` handles all valid input cases as described and meets the problem requirements, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
