Based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list and an integer `L` and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is `L`. It returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

The output hints summarize the code functionality, indicating that the function splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the value of `L`, with no modification to the original list or its elements. This is consistent with the problem description.

The output hints also cover all potential edge cases, including when `L` is `0`, when `L` equals `len(lst)`, and any value of `L` between these extremes. This ensures that the function handles all possible scenarios, further supporting the correctness of the program.

Given that the output hints align with the problem description and the original assessment, and that the code is consistent with these expectations, I conclude that the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
