Correctness: **True**

The code effectively splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the value of `L`, with no modification to the original list or its elements. It handles all potential edge cases, including when `L` is `0` (in which case the first list in the tuple is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`), when `L` equals `len(lst)` (in which case the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty), and any value of `L` between these extremes.

The function takes into account the problem description by considering the given list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns the resulting lists in a tuple, where the first part of the list has a length of `L`. It covers all cases that are outlined in the problem description and does not fail for any valid input.

For instance, given `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L = 3`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`. If `L = 0`, it returns `([], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, and if `L = len(lst)`, it returns `([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [])`.

Since the function handles all possible cases according to the problem description and no potential case is overlooked, the program is considered correct.
