The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` indeed takes a list and an integer `L` as input, splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

Upon examining the annotated version of the code, it confirms the correctness of the original assessment. The state before the function call specifies that `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which aligns with the problem description. The annotation after the return statement correctly describes the state of the program, indicating that the function returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.

The reason the original assessment remains accurate is that the function correctly handles the specified input conditions, and the annotated version provides further confirmation of this behavior. The function's use of list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) effectively splits the list as required, and the return statement correctly formats the result as a tuple.

Given that the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **True**
