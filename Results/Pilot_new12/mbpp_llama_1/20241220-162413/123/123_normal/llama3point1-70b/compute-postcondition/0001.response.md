The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst). After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the first L elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returns a tuple of two lists where the first list contains the first L elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.**
