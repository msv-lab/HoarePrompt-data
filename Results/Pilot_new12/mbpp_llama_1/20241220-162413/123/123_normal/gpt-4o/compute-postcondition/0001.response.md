The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst). After executing the function body, the function returns two lists: the first list contains the first L elements of 'lst', and the second list contains the remaining elements of 'lst' starting from index L to the end. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returns two lists where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst` from index `L` to the end.**
