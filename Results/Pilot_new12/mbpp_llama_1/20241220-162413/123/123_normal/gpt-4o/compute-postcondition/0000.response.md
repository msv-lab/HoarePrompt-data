To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides that `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This means `L` can be any integer from 0 up to the length of the list `lst`, inclusive.

The code snippet is `return lst[:L], lst[L:]`. This line of code splits the list `lst` into two parts at the index `L` and returns both parts.

- `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list from the beginning up to, but not including, the index `L`. This means it will return the first `L` elements of the list. If `L` is 0, this part will return an empty list. If `L` equals the length of the list, this part will return the entire list.
- `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list from the index `L` to the end of the list. If `L` equals the length of the list, this part will return an empty list because there are no elements after the last index.

Given the constraints on `L`, the program will return two lists:
1. The first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst`.
2. The second list contains the elements of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.

Since `L` can vary, the exact composition of these two returned lists will depend on the value of `L` relative to the length and content of `lst`. However, we know that the first list will have `L` elements (or fewer if `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, which is not possible given the constraints but is a consideration in general list slicing), and the second list will have the remaining elements of `lst`, if any.

Output State: **The program returns two lists: the first list contains the first L elements of 'lst', and the second list contains the remaining elements of 'lst' starting from index L to the end, where L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).**
