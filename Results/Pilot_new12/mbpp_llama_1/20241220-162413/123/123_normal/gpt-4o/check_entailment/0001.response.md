Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` and splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this, returning a tuple containing the two resulting lists.

The program correctly handles different types of input lists (e.g., integers, characters) and different values of `L`, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. It also handles cases where `L` is less than the length of the list, as shown in the tests.

In general, the function will work correctly for any valid input list and integer `L`, regardless of the type of elements in the list or the value of `L`. The function does not modify the original list and raises no exceptions, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.

The key insight here is that the function does not check if `L` is greater than the length of the list. However, in Python, if `L` is greater than the length of the list, the slicing operation `lst[:L]` will simply return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify what should happen in this case. Therefore, the program can be considered correct even in this edge case.
