Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and splits the list into two parts, where the length of the first part is `L`. The function then returns a tuple containing these two parts.

The code uses list slicing, which is a standard Python feature, to split the list. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from index `L`.

After examining the provided unit tests and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function works as expected. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L` is `3`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, which is the expected result.

Some edge cases to consider:

- An empty list: If the input list is empty (`[]`), the function will return `([], [])`, which is the expected result.
- `L` is equal to the length of the list: If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function will return `(list, [])`, which is the expected result.
- `L` is greater than the length of the list: If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the function will return `(list, [])`, which is the expected result, because there are no more elements to include in the second part of the tuple.
- `L` is 0: If `L` is 0, the function will return `([], list)`, which is the expected result.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, and no incorrect behavior was found. Therefore, it is concluded that the function is correct.
