Correctness: **True**

The program does what the problem description asks for. It correctly splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters.
2. It uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list into two parts: `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.
3. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`.
4. The expression `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.
5. The function returns a tuple containing these two lists.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid (i.e., `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`), the program will always produce the correct output.

For example, if `lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]` and `L = 3`, the function will return `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, which is the correct result.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the program behaves as expected.
