You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3) == ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2) == (['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])
assert func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4) == (['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])

def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and splits the list into two parts, where the length of the first part is `L`. The function then returns a tuple containing these two parts.

The code uses list slicing, which is a standard Python feature, to split the list. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from index `L`.

After examining the provided unit tests and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function works as expected. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `L` is `3`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, which is the expected result.

Some edge cases to consider:

- An empty list: If the input list is empty (`[]`), the function will return `([], [])`, which is the expected result.
- `L` is equal to the length of the list: If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the function will return `(list, [])`, which is the expected result.
- `L` is greater than the length of the list: If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the function will return `(list, [])`, which is the expected result, because there are no more elements to include in the second part of the tuple.
- `L` is 0: If `L` is 0, the function will return `([], list)`, which is the expected result.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, and no incorrect behavior was found. Therefore, it is concluded that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function splits a given list `lst` into two separate lists at a specified index `L`, where `L` is a non-negative integer between 0 and the length of `lst` (inclusive), and returns these two lists. The first returned list contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst` from index `L` to the end. This splitting operation does not modify the original list `lst` but instead creates two new lists based on the specified index. The function handles edge cases where `L` is 0 (returning an empty list as the first element and the entire original list as the second element) and where `L` equals the length of `lst` (returning the entire original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
