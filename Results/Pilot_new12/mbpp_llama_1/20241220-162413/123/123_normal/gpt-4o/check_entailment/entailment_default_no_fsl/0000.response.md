Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately implements the described functionality. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs, splits the list into two parts at the specified index `L`, and returns these parts as a tuple of two lists.

The code uses Python's list slicing feature (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) to create the two parts of the list. This approach correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints, including:

- When `L` is 0, it returns an empty list as the first element and the entire original list as the second element.
- When `L` equals the length of `lst`, it returns the entire original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element.
- When `L` is a positive integer between 0 and the length of `lst` (exclusive), it correctly splits the list at the specified index.

The function does not modify the original list but instead creates two new lists, which aligns with the problem description's requirements. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., `lst` will be a list and `L` will be a non-negative integer not exceeding the length of `lst`), the function `func_1` correctly implements the specified behavior for every potential case.
