Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. 

The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` and splits the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. It returns these two parts as a tuple.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the list. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the expression `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.

This splitting operation does not modify the original list `lst` but instead creates two new lists based on the specified index. The function handles edge cases where `L` is 0 (returning an empty list as the first element and the entire original list as the second element) and where `L` equals the length of `lst` (returning the entire original list as the first element and an empty list as the second element).

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function, showing that it works as expected for different inputs and edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
