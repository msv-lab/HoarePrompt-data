The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description and code. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, splitting the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and then returns these two parts as a tuple.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by detailing the state of the program before and after the function call. It correctly identifies that `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which aligns with the problem's constraints. The annotations also accurately describe the function's behavior, including its handling of edge cases where `L` is 0 or equal to the length of `lst`.

Given this information, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. It correctly splits the list at the specified index `L` and returns the resulting lists without modifying the original list. The original assessment considered various potential cases, including edge cases, and found the function to behave as expected in all these scenarios.

The refinements provided by the annotated version do not introduce any deviations from the expected behavior but instead reinforce the understanding of how the function operates under different conditions. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of **True** is justified because the program meets the problem description's requirements, and the annotated version supports this conclusion without introducing any evidence to the contrary.

Final: **True**
