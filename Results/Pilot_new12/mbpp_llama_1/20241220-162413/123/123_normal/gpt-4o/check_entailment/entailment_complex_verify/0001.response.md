The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into two parts at the specified index `L`, returning the first `L` elements and the remaining elements as a tuple of two lists. This behavior aligns with the problem description, which asks for the list to be split in such a manner.

The annotated version of the code further clarifies the behavior of the function, confirming that it handles edge cases where `L` is 0 or equals the length of `lst`, and that it does not modify the original list. The annotations also specify the state of the program before the function call, assuming that `lst` is a list and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, which aligns with the problem's implicit assumptions about valid input.

Given that the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, handles relevant edge cases, and the annotations support this behavior, there is no reason to alter the original assessment.

Final: **True**
