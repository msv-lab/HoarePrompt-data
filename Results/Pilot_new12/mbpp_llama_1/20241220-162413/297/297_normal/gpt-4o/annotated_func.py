#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with at least two elements.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with at least two elements and returns a new tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `t`. The input tuple `t` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify it. The returned tuple will have one less element than the input tuple `t`, as each product is calculated from a pair of consecutive numbers. The function handles tuples with any number of elements greater than or equal to 2, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than two elements, which could potentially lead to an error or incorrect results if such a tuple is passed to the function. The function's return value is a tuple, which means it is immutable, and its contents cannot be modified after it is returned.
