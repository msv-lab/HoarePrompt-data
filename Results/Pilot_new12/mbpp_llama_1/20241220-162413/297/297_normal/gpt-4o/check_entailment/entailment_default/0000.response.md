Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `t` of numbers as input and returns a new tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `t`. The function uses a generator expression to calculate these products and returns the result as a tuple.

The code correctly handles tuples of any length greater than or equal to 1, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. The function returns an empty tuple when the input tuple has only one element, which is consistent with the problem description.

The output hints agree with the code and help confirm that the function behaves as expected. The hints mention that the function handles tuples with any number of elements greater than or equal to 2, which is demonstrated by the provided unit tests. The code does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than two elements, but according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Overall, based on the provided code, output hints, and unit tests, it appears that the function correctly implements the desired behavior and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
