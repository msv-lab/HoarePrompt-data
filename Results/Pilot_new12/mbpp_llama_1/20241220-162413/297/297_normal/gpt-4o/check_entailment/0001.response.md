Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of the same length minus one, where each element is the product of the corresponding element and the next one in the input tuple.

The program correctly handles cases with tuples of different lengths, including the edge case where the input tuple contains only one element, in which case an empty tuple is returned.

The use of a generator expression within the `tuple()` function allows for an efficient and concise way to calculate the products without needing to explicitly create a list or iterate over the tuple more times than necessary.

All provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program for various input scenarios. Without being able to identify any potential case where the program fails to meet the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
