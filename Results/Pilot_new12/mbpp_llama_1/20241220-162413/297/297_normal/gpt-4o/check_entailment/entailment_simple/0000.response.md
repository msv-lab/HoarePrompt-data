To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to compare its functionality with the given problem description.

The problem description states that the function should take a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})` as input and return a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

The provided program defines a function `func_1(t)` that uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to compute the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `t`. The expression `t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)` generates the products from `t_1*t_2` to `t_N*t_{N+1}`, which matches the requirement specified in the problem description.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Handling of Input Tuple**: The function accepts a tuple `t` as input, which aligns with the problem description's requirement that the input should be a tuple of numbers `(t_1,..., t_{N+1})`.

2. **Computing Products of Consecutive Pairs**: The program correctly computes the products of consecutive pairs of numbers using the expression `t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)`. This ensures that each element in the output tuple corresponds to the product of the `i-th` element and the `(i+1)-th` element from the input tuple.

3. **Output Tuple Length**: The function returns a tuple of length `N`, where `N` is one less than the length of the input tuple (since it's computed over `range(len(t) - 1)`). This matches the problem description's requirement that the output tuple should have `N` elements when the input tuple has `N+1` elements.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input tuple has only one element, in which case it returns an empty tuple. This behavior is consistent with the problem description's requirements, given that for an input of length 1 (e.g., `(12,)`), there are no pairs to compute products from, resulting in an empty output tuple.

In conclusion, since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description for all potential cases, including handling the input tuple, computing the products of consecutive pairs, ensuring the correct length of the output tuple, and managing edge cases, it is considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
