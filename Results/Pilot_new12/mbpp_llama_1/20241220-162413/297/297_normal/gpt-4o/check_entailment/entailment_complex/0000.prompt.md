You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
assert func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7)) == (8, 20, 30, 42)
assert func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15)) == (156, 182, 126, 135)
assert func_1((12,)) == ()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with at least two elements.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with at least two elements and returns a new tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `t`. The input tuple `t` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify it. The returned tuple will have one less element than the input tuple `t`, as each product is calculated from a pair of consecutive numbers. The function handles tuples with any number of elements greater than or equal to 2, and it does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than two elements, which could potentially lead to an error or incorrect results if such a tuple is passed to the function. The function's return value is a tuple, which means it is immutable, and its contents cannot be modified after it is returned.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
