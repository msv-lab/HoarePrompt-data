Correctness: **True**.

I think the code is correct in every case because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input, multiplies each number with its next number, and returns a tuple of these products. The code uses a generator expression to efficiently calculate these products.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the code works correctly for different inputs. The code handles edge cases, such as a tuple with only one element, correctly by returning an empty tuple.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code works:

1. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple `t`, excluding the last index.
2. For each index `i`, it multiplies the element at `t[i]` with the element at `t[i + 1]`, which is the next element in the tuple.
3. The results of these multiplications are collected into a tuple using the `tuple` constructor.
4. The resulting tuple is returned as the output of the function.

Overall, the code is concise, efficient, and correctly implements the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
