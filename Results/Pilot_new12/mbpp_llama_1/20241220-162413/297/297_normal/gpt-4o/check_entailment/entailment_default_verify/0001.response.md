The original assessment is that the program is correct, and after re-examining the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with this assessment.

The program is designed to take a tuple of numbers as input and return a new tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to achieve this, which is an efficient and concise way to calculate the products.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts a tuple of numbers with at least two elements, returns a new tuple with one less element than the input tuple, and does not modify the input tuple. The hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for tuples with less than two elements, but since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the program for various input scenarios.

One potential edge case to consider is when the input tuple has only one element, as mentioned in the output hints. However, the program correctly handles this case by returning an empty tuple, as demonstrated by the unit test `assert func_1((12,)) == ()`.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
