Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `t` of numbers as input and returns a new tuple containing the products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression to calculate the products and the `tuple` function to convert the generator expression into a tuple.

The code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. The function handles tuples with any number of elements greater than or equal to 2, and it returns an empty tuple when the input tuple has only one element.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality. The hints mention that the function accepts a tuple with at least two elements, returns a new tuple with one less element than the input tuple, and does not modify the input tuple.

The program description and the examples provided in the code also match the function's behavior. For example, `func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` returns `(5, 35, 56, 80)`, which are the products of consecutive pairs of numbers in the input tuple.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, the program is correct and handles every potential case as expected.
