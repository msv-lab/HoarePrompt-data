Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a tuple of products of consecutive pairs of numbers. The returned tuple has a length one less than the input tuple. The function handles tuples of any length greater than 1, and the product of each pair of consecutive numbers is calculated and included in the output tuple. No error handling or edge cases are explicitly handled in the function, implying that it assumes the input will always be a tuple of numbers with at least two elements. If the input tuple has exactly two elements, the function returns a tuple with one element, which is the product of the two input numbers. For tuples with more than two elements, each element (except the last one) is multiplied by the element immediately following it, and these products are collected into the output tuple.**
