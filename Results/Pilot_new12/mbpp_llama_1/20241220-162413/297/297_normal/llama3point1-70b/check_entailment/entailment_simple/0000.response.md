Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description requires a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i`-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

The given function `func_1` does exactly this. It uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the input tuple `numbers` with the next element, and then uses a generator expression to multiply each pair of elements together. The result is a tuple of products of consecutive pairs of numbers from the input tuple `numbers`, with a length one less than `numbers`.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, the function will return the tuple `(1*2, 2*3, 3*4, 4*5) = (2, 6, 12, 20)`, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The function works for any valid input tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2, and it always returns a tuple of the correct length with the correct products of consecutive pairs of numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
