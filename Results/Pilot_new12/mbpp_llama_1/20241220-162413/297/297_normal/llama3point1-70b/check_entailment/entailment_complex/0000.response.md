Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.

The program uses the `zip` function to iterate over the input tuple and the tuple shifted by one element (`numbers[1:]`), effectively creating pairs of consecutive elements. The `tuple` function is then used to create a new tuple containing the products of these pairs, which is returned by the function.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function will return the tuple `(2, 6, 12)`, which is the desired output according to the problem description.

The program handles tuples of any length greater than 1, as stated in the problem description. The output tuple has a length one less than the input tuple, as required.

Overall, the program correctly implements the specified functionality, and therefore, it is correct.
