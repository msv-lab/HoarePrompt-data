Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N, where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}. The `zip` function is used to pair each element in the input tuple with the next one, and a generator expression is used to multiply corresponding elements and create the output tuple.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function takes a tuple `numbers` as input.
2. The `zip` function is used to pair each element in `numbers` with the next one, effectively creating pairs (t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3),..., (t_N, t_{N+1}).
3. The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` multiplies corresponding elements in each pair and generates the output values.
4. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned as the output.

For example, if the input is `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, the `zip` function will create pairs `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 5)`, and the generator expression will generate values `1*2 = 2`, `2*3 = 6`, `3*4 = 12`, `4*5 = 20`. The output tuple will be `(2, 6, 12, 20)`, which is the expected result.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and works for all possible inputs, the correctness is **True**.
