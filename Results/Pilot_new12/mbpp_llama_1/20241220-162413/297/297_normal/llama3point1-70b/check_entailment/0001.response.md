Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.

Here's why the code works:

- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` as input.
- It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the input tuple and the same tuple shifted by one element (`numbers[1:]`).
- The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` calculates the product of each pair of adjacent elements.
- Finally, the `tuple` function converts the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned.

This implementation correctly handles tuples of any length, including edge cases such as an empty tuple or a tuple with only one element (although the problem description implies that the input tuple should have at least two elements, as it asks for a tuple of length N where N is presumably the original length minus one).

To illustrate, consider the following example:
```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
result = func_1(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (2, 6, 12)
```
This output matches the expected result, where each element in the output tuple is the product of the corresponding element and the next one in the input tuple.

Without any counterexamples where the program fails to meet the requirements, the code can be considered correct.
