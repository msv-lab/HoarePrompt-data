The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description, which states that the function should take a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the function indeed takes a tuple of numbers with at least 2 elements and returns a tuple of products of consecutive pairs of numbers, with a length one less than the input tuple. This matches the problem description.

The annotated version of the code also highlights that the function assumes the input will always be a tuple of numbers with at least two elements, which is a valid assumption given the problem description.

The original assessment provides a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct, which is accurate and consistent with the annotated version of the code.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program's correctness is maintained.

The reason I keep the original assessment is that both the original code and the annotated version of the code correctly implement the problem description, and the assumptions made by the function are valid given the problem description.

Final: **True**
