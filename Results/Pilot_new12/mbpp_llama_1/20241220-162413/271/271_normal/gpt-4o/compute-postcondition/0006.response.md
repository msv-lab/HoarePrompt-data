According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. If `i` is less than `num_elements`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `num_elements` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `num_elements` must be greater than 1.

Since `i` is used to index the positions in the inner tuples, we also need to update `elements_at_position` to contain the elements at the next position in each inner tuple. 

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
