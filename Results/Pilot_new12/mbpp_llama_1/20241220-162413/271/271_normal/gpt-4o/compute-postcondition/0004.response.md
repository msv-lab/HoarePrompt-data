To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 0.
- `averages` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

The code calculates the average of the elements at the current position (`elements_at_position`) and assigns it to `avg`:
```python
avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
```
Given that `elements_at_position` contains the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, the `sum(elements_at_position)` will calculate the sum of these first elements, and `len(tuples)` gives the total number of inner tuples. Thus, `avg` will be the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

The output state will include all initial state information that is still valid plus the new information about `avg`. Since `averages` is mentioned but not modified in the given code snippet, and `num_elements`, `i`, and the contents of `tuples` and `elements_at_position` are not modified, their states remain unchanged.

The new variable `avg` is introduced, which is the average of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, or more specifically:
```python
avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
```
The other variables retain their initial values/state:
- `tuples` remains a tuple of tuples with the same inner tuple length and containing numbers.
- `num_elements` is still greater than 0.
- `averages` remains an empty list.
- `i` is still 0.
- `elements_at_position` still contains the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is the average of the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
