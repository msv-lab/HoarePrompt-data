Functionality: **The function calculates and returns a list of averages of elements at corresponding positions across all inner tuples in the input `tuples`. The length of the returned list is equal to the number of elements in each inner tuple, which must be the same for all inner tuples, if there is at least one element, otherwise it returns an empty list. The input `tuples` remains unchanged as a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers. The function handles the edge case where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples with zero elements, in which case it returns an empty list. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type or values, assuming that the input is a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers.**
