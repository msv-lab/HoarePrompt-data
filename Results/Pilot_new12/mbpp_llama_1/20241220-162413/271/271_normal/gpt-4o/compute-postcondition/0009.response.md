The provided Python code snippet is: 
```
averages.append(avg)
```
Here, `avg` is the average of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`. 

The value of `averages` is updated by appending `avg` to it. `avg` equals `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` which is the average of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, 
`num_elements` is greater than 1, 
`averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position and now includes the average of the second elements, 
`i` is 1, 
`elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, 
`avg` is the average of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples` equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position including the average of the second elements, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and `averages` now includes `avg`**
