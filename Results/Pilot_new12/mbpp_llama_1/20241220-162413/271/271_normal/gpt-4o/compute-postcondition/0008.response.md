The new variable `avg` is assigned the value of the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the number of tuples in `tuples`. The value of `avg` is equal to the average of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`. 

The value of `elements_at_position` is the list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`. The value of `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers. The value of `num_elements` is greater than 1. The value of `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position. The value of `i` is 1.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is the average of the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples` equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
