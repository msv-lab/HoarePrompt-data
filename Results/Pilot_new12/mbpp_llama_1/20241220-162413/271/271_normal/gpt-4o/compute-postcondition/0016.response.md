The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of averages. Each average in the list is calculated from elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. The length of the returned list is determined by the number of elements in the inner tuples, but it will be empty if the number of elements is not greater than 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers, and returns a list of averages calculated from elements at the same position across all inner tuples, with the list length equal to the number of elements in the inner tuples if greater than 0, otherwise an empty list.**
