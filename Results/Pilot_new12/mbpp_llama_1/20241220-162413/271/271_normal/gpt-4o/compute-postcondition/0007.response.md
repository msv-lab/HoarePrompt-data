To calculate the result, let's consider the impact of the code on the program.

The given code is `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`. 

In the initial state, `i` is 1. 

So, `elements_at_position` will now contain the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, 
`num_elements` is greater than 1, 
`averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position, 
`i` is 1, 
`elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`**
