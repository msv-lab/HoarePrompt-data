To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 2.
- `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position including the average of the second and third elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the third elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.
- `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

The given code is:
```python
elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
```

This code updates the `elements_at_position` list by taking the `i-th` element from each inner tuple `t` in `tuples`. Since `i` is 2, this means it takes the third element from each inner tuple.

Given that `i` is 2, the new `elements_at_position` will be a list of the third elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`. This directly affects the value of `avg` because `avg` is calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. Therefore, after updating `elements_at_position`, `avg` will be the average of the third elements of the inner tuples in `tuples`.

The other variables (`tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state, considering the update of `elements_at_position` and its implication on `avg`, is:
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 2.
- `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position including the average of the second and third elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the third elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`.
- `avg` is the average of the third elements of the inner tuples in `tuples`, which can be expressed as `sum([t[2] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 2, `averages` is a list containing averages of elements at each position including the average of the second and third elements, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the third elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum([t[2] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`**
