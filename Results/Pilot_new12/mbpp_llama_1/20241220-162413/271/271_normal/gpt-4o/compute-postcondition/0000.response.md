The code assigns the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples` to the variable `num_elements`. Since each inner tuple has the same length, `num_elements` will be the length of any inner tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of any inner tuple in `tuples`**
