The code creates a new list `elements_at_position` that contains the elements at the current index `i` from each inner tuple in the `tuples` tuple. The value of `i` is 0, so `elements_at_position` will contain the first element from each inner tuple.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `tuples` remains the same, `num_elements` is still greater than 0, `averages` is still an empty list, and `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of each inner tuple in `tuples`**
