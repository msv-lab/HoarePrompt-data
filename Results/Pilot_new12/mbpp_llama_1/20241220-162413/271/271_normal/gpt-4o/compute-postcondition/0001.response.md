The code initializes an empty list `averages`. The initial state's conditions, such as `tuples` being a tuple of tuples with each inner tuple having the same length and containing numbers, and `num_elements` being equal to the length of any inner tuple in `tuples`, remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of any inner tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is an empty list**
