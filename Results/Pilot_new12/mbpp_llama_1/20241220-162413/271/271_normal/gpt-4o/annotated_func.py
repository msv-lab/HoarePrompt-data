#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is the length of any inner tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, with the same length as `num_elements` if `num_elements` is greater than 0, otherwise `averages` is an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated from elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, and the length of the list is equal to `num_elements` if `num_elements` is greater than 0, otherwise an empty list is returned
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of averages of elements at corresponding positions across all inner tuples in the input `tuples`. The length of the returned list is equal to the number of elements in each inner tuple, which must be the same for all inner tuples, if there is at least one element, otherwise it returns an empty list. The input `tuples` remains unchanged as a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers. The function handles the edge case where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples with zero elements, in which case it returns an empty list. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type or values, assuming that the input is a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers.
