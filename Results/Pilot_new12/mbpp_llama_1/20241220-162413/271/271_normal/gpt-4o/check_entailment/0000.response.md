Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It takes a tuple of tuples as input, calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, and returns these averages as a list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function correctly initializes the `num_elements` variable with the number of elements in the first tuple of the input. It also creates an empty list `averages` to store the calculated averages.

2. **Looping through positions**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through each position in the tuples. For each position `i`, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension: `[t[i] for t in tuples]`.

3. **Calculating the average**: It then calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples (`len(tuples)`).

4. **Storing the average**: The calculated average is appended to the `averages` list.

5. **Returning the averages**: Finally, the function returns the `averages` list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also seem to be correctly implemented and passed by the function, which further supports the correctness of the code.

No potential cases were found where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
