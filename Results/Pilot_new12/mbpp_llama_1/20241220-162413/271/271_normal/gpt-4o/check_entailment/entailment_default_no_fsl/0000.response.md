Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list of averages of elements at corresponding positions across all inner tuples. The code handles the edge case where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples with zero elements, returning an empty list in such cases.

The code assumes that the input is a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers, which aligns with the problem description. It correctly calculates the averages by summing the elements at each position and dividing by the total number of inner tuples.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the code's correctness for various input scenarios. The code's logic is straightforward and correctly implements the required functionality.

The output hints provided in the problem description match the code's behavior, and there are no apparent missing edge cases or incorrect assumptions. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the code correctly implements the required functionality for every potential case.
