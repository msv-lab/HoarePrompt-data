Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input, calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, and returns a list of these averages.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first determines the number of elements in each inner tuple using `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`. This is correct because the problem description states that all inner tuples have the same length.

2. It then initializes an empty list `averages` to store the calculated averages.

3. The program uses a loop to iterate over each position in the inner tuples. For each position `i`, it extracts the elements at that position from all inner tuples using a list comprehension: `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`.

4. It then calculates the average of these elements using `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. This is correct because the average is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values, which is equal to the number of inner tuples.

5. The calculated average is appended to the `averages` list.

6. After iterating over all positions, the program returns the `averages` list, which contains the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Inner tuples with different lengths are not a concern because the problem description states that all inner tuples have the same length.
* Empty inner tuples are not a concern because the problem description does not mention this case, and we assume that the input will be valid.
* The program correctly handles the case where there is only one inner tuple, because the average of a single value is the value itself.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
