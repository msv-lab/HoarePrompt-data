Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input and calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple.
2. It first determines the number of elements in each tuple by getting the length of the first tuple (`num_elements = len(tuples[0])`).
3. Then, it iterates over each position in the tuples using a for loop (`for i in range(num_elements)`).
4. Inside the loop, it extracts the elements at the current position from all tuples using a list comprehension (`elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`).
5. It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples (`avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`).
6. The calculated average is then appended to the `averages` list.
7. Finally, the function returns the `averages` list.

The code handles all potential cases correctly because:

- It assumes that all tuples have the same number of elements, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement.
- It correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple.
- It handles tuples with different data types (e.g., integers, floats) because Python's built-in `sum` and division operators can handle these types.

Since the code handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct. If there were any edge cases that the code didn't handle, such as tuples with different lengths or non-numeric values, the correctness would be **False**. But in this case, the code seems to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples.
