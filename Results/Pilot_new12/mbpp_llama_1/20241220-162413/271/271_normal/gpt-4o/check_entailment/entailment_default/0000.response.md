Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code calculates the average of corresponding elements from each tuple in the input `tuples`. The length of the returned list is equal to the number of elements in each inner tuple, which must be the same for all inner tuples. The function handles the edge cases where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples with zero elements correctly by returning an empty list.

The provided unit tests confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The function assumes that the input is a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description. 

The code iterates over each position in the inner tuples, calculates the average of the elements at that position, and appends the average to the `averages` list. The average is calculated as the sum of the elements at the current position divided by the number of tuples, which is correct.

Since the code handles all potential cases correctly and produces the expected output for the provided unit tests, it is considered correct.
