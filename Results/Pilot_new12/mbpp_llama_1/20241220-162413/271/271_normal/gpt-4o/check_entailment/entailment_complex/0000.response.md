Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
2. The function calculates the average of elements at each position across all inner tuples. This is achieved by iterating over the indices of the inner tuples using `range(num_elements)`.
3. For each index `i`, the function extracts the elements at that position from all inner tuples using a list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]`.
4. The function then calculates the average of these elements by summing them up using `sum(elements_at_position)` and dividing by the number of inner tuples using `len(tuples)`.
5. The calculated average is appended to the `averages` list.
6. The function returns the `averages` list, which contains the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples.

The program handles the edge case where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples with zero elements, as it returns an empty list in such cases.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. The function's implementation is straightforward and correctly implements the problem description.

Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program does not need to perform error checking on the input type or values. The function's behavior is well-defined and consistent with the problem description for all valid inputs.
