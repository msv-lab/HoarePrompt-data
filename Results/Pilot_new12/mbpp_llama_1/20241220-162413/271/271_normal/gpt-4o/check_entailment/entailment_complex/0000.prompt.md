You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is the length of any inner tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, with the same length as `num_elements` if `num_elements` is greater than 0, otherwise `averages` is an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated from elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, and the length of the list is equal to `num_elements` if `num_elements` is greater than 0, otherwise an empty list is returned
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of averages of elements at corresponding positions across all inner tuples in the input `tuples`. The length of the returned list is equal to the number of elements in each inner tuple, which must be the same for all inner tuples, if there is at least one element, otherwise it returns an empty list. The input `tuples` remains unchanged as a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers. The function handles the edge case where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples with zero elements, in which case it returns an empty list. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type or values, assuming that the input is a tuple of tuples with equal length inner tuples containing numbers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
