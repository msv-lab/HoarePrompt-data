Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tuples)` correctly calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. The function uses the `zip(*tuples)` expression to transpose the tuples, grouping corresponding elements together. It then calculates the average of each group using a list comprehension.

The function handles tuples of tuples with numbers, and it assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. Although the function does not perform any error checking or handling for edge cases such as empty input or non-numeric values, the problem description assumes that the input will be valid.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of how the function works. The function returns a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements divided by the total number of inner tuples.

To verify the correctness of the function, consider the following example:

Input: `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`

Expected output: `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`

The function correctly calculates the average of each position:

- Position 0: `(1 + 4 + 7) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4.0`
- Position 1: `(2 + 5 + 8) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5.0`
- Position 2: `(3 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6.0`

The function returns the expected output, which is a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples. Therefore, the code is correct, and it works as expected for every potential case.
