Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Here's why it's correct:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and transposes it, so that the i-th tuple in the output contains the i-th element from each of the input tuples. This allows the program to compute the average of the values at each position across all tuples.
- The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` then computes the average of the values in each of these transposed tuples. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of the values in the tuple, and `len(tuples)` gives the number of tuples in the input, which is used to compute the average.

For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the `zip(*tuples)` expression will produce `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`. Then, the list comprehension will compute the averages as `[(1+4+7)/3, (2+5+8)/3, (3+6+9)/3]`, which simplifies to `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`. This is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including empty tuples and tuples with varying lengths (although the problem description doesn't explicitly address tuples with varying lengths, the program will raise an error in this case due to the `zip` function stopping at the end of the shortest tuple). However, based on the problem description that asks for averages of corresponding values, it's implied that the input tuples should have the same length. If the input tuples can have different lengths, the problem description should specify how to handle this case. Assuming the input tuples always have the same length, the program works correctly for all valid inputs.
