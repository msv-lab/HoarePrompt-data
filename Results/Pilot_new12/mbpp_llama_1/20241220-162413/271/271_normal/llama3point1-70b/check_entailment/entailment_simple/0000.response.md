Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it's correct:

1. **Processing a tuple of tuples**: The function `func_1(tuples)` takes a tuple of tuples as input. This aligns with the problem description, which requires processing tuples of tuples.

2. **Extracting corresponding values**: The `zip(*tuples)` expression is used to extract corresponding values from each inner tuple. This is a standard approach in Python to transpose a tuple of tuples, ensuring that values at the same position in each inner tuple are grouped together.

3. **Calculating averages**: For each group of corresponding values, the program calculates the average by summing the values (`sum(val)`) and dividing by the total number of tuples (`len(tuples)`). This step directly follows the problem description's requirement to compute the average of values from all tuples at each position.

4. **Returning a list of averages**: The program returns a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the calculated mean of the values at the same position in all inner tuples. This matches the expected output as per the problem description.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers), the program accurately performs the specified task. It does not contain any logic that would make it deviate from the problem description's requirements for any potential valid input case. Therefore, the program's correctness in meeting the problem description's specifications can be confirmed.
