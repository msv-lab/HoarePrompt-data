Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the function as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples.

The code uses a list comprehension with the `zip(*tuples)` expression to group corresponding elements from each tuple together. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of these corresponding elements, and `len(tuples)` gives the total number of tuples, which is used to calculate the average.

The output hints describe potential edge cases, such as an empty input tuple or non-numeric values in the inner tuples, which could raise errors. However, since we assume that the input will be valid, these edge cases are not considered invalid cases for the purpose of evaluating the program's correctness.

Given the assumption of valid input, the code should work correctly for every potential case, as it correctly calculates the averages of corresponding elements in the inner tuples and returns them in a list. 

For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will return `[(1+4)/2, (2+5)/2, (3+6)/2] = [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]`, which is the expected output according to the problem description. 

Overall, as long as the input is valid (i.e., a non-empty tuple of tuples with the same length, containing only numeric values), the code will produce the correct output, making it a correct implementation of the described function.
