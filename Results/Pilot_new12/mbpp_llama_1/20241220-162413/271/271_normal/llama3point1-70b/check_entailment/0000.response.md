Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a list comprehension that uses the `zip(*tuples)` expression to transpose the input tuples, so that the corresponding values from each tuple are grouped together. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of these corresponding values, and dividing by `len(tuples)` calculates the average.

This program correctly handles all potential cases because:

1. It handles tuples of any length: The `zip(*tuples)` expression automatically stops at the end of the shortest tuple, so the program works even if the tuples are not all the same length.
2. It handles tuples with any type of numeric values: The program works with both integers and floating-point numbers.
3. It handles an empty input: If the input is an empty tuple, the program returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
4. It handles the case where all tuples have only one element: In this case, the program returns a list with one element, which is the average of all the elements (i.e., the sum of all elements divided by the number of tuples).

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple for all possible inputs.
