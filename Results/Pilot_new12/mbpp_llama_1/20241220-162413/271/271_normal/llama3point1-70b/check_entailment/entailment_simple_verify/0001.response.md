The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on the problem description. The reasoning provided in the original assessment is sound and matches the problem description's requirements. The annotated code further supports the correctness of the program by explicitly stating that the input is a tuple of tuples with the same length and that the output is a list of averages as required by the problem description.

The key points that support the program's correctness are:
1. The use of `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the input tuple of tuples, which allows for the calculation of averages at each position across all tuples.
2. The calculation of the average using `sum(val) / len(tuples)`, which correctly computes the sum of the values at each position and then divides by the total number of tuples to obtain the average.
3. The annotations provided in the code confirm that the program expects a tuple of tuples with the same length as input and returns a list of averages as output, aligning with the problem description.

Given that the program meets the problem description's requirements, that the original assessment's reasoning is sound, and that the annotated code supports the correctness of the program, there is no evidence to suggest that the program does not meet the specified requirements.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the reasoning provided, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.

Final: **True**
