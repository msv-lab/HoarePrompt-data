You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples of the input tuple of tuples, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples. The function handles tuples of tuples with numbers, and it assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. If the input tuple is empty, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when attempting to calculate the average. If the inner tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to calculate the sum. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases, and it does not modify the input tuple of tuples in any way. The output list of averages will have the same length as the inner tuples, and each average will be a floating-point number.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
