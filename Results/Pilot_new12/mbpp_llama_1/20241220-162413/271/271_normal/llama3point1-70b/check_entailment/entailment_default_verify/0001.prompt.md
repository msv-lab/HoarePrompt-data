You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Here's why it's correct:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and transposes it, so that the i-th tuple in the output contains the i-th element from each of the input tuples. This allows the program to compute the average of the values at each position across all tuples.
- The list comprehension `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` then computes the average of the values in each of these transposed tuples. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of the values in the tuple, and `len(tuples)` gives the number of tuples in the input, which is used to compute the average.

For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, the `zip(*tuples)` expression will produce `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`. Then, the list comprehension will compute the averages as `[(1+4+7)/3, (2+5+8)/3, (3+6+9)/3]`, which simplifies to `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`. This is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including empty tuples and tuples with varying lengths (although the problem description doesn't explicitly address tuples with varying lengths, the program will raise an error in this case due to the `zip` function stopping at the end of the shortest tuple). However, based on the problem description that asks for averages of corresponding values, it's implied that the input tuples should have the same length. If the input tuples can have different lengths, the problem description should specify how to handle this case. Assuming the input tuples always have the same length, the program works correctly for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples of the input tuple of tuples, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples. The function handles tuples of tuples with numbers, and it assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. If the input tuple is empty, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when attempting to calculate the average. If the inner tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to calculate the sum. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases, and it does not modify the input tuple of tuples in any way. The output list of averages will have the same length as the inner tuples, and each average will be a floating-point number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
