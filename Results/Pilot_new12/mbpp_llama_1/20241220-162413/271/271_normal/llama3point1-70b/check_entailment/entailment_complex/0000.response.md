Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description states that the function takes a tuple of tuples as input, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. The program assumes this and does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid inputs.

2. **Average Calculation**: The problem description requires the function to compute the average of values from all tuples at each position. The program uses the `zip(*tuples)` expression to transpose the tuples, effectively grouping corresponding elements from each tuple together. Then, it calculates the average for each group using the `(sum(val) / len(tuples))` expression.

3. **Return Value**: The problem description states that the function should return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. The program returns a list of averages, where each average is calculated as described above.

4. **Length of Inner Tuples**: The problem description implies that the function should handle tuples of tuples with any length, as long as all inner tuples have the same length. The program handles this correctly by using `zip(*tuples)`, which automatically stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. Since all inner tuples have the same length, this is not a concern in this case.

5. **Assumptions**: The problem description and the program both assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty tuple of tuples with numbers, where all inner tuples have the same length). Since we are given that the input will always be valid, the program does not need to handle edge cases like empty tuples or non-numeric values.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
