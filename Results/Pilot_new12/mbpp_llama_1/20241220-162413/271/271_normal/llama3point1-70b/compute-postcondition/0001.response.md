The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of averages. Each average in the list is calculated as the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of tuples with numbers, returns a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples.**
