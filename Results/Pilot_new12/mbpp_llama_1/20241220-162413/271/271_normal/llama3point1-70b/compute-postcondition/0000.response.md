The code provided calculates the average of corresponding elements in the inner tuples of the 'tuples' tuple. The `zip(*tuples)` expression transposes the tuple of tuples, so that the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the inner tuples. The list comprehension then calculates the sum of each of these transposed tuples and divides it by the total number of inner tuples.

Since 'tuples' is a tuple of tuples where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers, and 'val' represents each transposed tuple (which is a tuple of numbers), 'sum(val)' represents the sum of these numbers and 'len(tuples)' represents the total number of inner tuples.

Therefore, the program returns a list of averages, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples.

Output State: **The program returns a list of averages, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples.**
