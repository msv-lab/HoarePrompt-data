The function calculates and returns a list of averages for corresponding elements in the inner tuples of the input tuple of tuples, where each average is the sum of corresponding elements in the inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples. The function handles tuples of tuples with numbers, and it assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. If the input tuple is empty, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when attempting to calculate the average. If the inner tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to calculate the sum. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for these edge cases, and it does not modify the input tuple of tuples in any way. The output list of averages will have the same length as the inner tuples, and each average will be a floating-point number.
