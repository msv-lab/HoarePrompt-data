You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the given Python program and found that it correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number `n` as input and returns `True` if the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

The program uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Input month numbers between 1 and 12
* Input month numbers outside the range 1-12
* Edge cases such as inputting 0 or negative numbers

In all these cases, the program behaves correctly. If the input month number is between 1 and 12 and has 31 days, the function returns `True`. If the input month number is between 1 and 12 but does not have 31 days, the function returns `False`. If the input month number is outside the range 1-12, the function still returns `False`, which is the expected behavior since months outside this range do not have 31 days.

Overall, I have found no potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a month as an integer `n` and returns `True` if the month has 31 days, `False` otherwise. The function handles months from 1 to 12, where months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 have 31 days. The function does not perform any error checking on the input month `n`, so it assumes that `n` is within the range of 1 to 12. If `n` is outside this range, the function will still return a result, but it may not be meaningful. For example, if `n` is 0 or a negative number, the function will return `False`, and if `n` is 13 or greater, the function will also return `False`. The function's return value can be used to determine whether a given month has 31 days, but it does not account for any other month-related properties or errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
