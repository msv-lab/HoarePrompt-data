You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It does this by defining a list of months that have 31 days (`months_31_days`) and then checking if the input month number `n` is in this list. 

This approach is correct because it accurately identifies all months with 31 days. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all included in the `months_31_days` list.

The function is also robust because it implicitly handles months that do not have 31 days by returning `False` for them (since they are not in the `months_31_days` list). It also correctly handles the input validation implicitly, as the condition of being in the list will be `False` for months not listed, implying that the function assumes valid month inputs (1 through 12). 

For all potential month inputs from 1 to 12, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, no potential case of incorrect behavior could be identified within the scope of the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a month as an integer `n` and returns `True` if the month has 31 days, `False` otherwise. The function handles months from 1 to 12, where months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 have 31 days. The function does not perform any error checking on the input month `n`, so it assumes that `n` is within the range of 1 to 12. If `n` is outside this range, the function will still return a result, but it may not be meaningful. For example, if `n` is 0 or a negative number, the function will return `False`, and if `n` is 13 or greater, the function will also return `False`. The function's return value can be used to determine whether a given month has 31 days, but it does not account for any other month-related properties or errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
