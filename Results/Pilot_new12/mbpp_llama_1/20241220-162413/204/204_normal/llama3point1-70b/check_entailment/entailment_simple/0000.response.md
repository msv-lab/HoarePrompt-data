Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing a month number and checks if it is in the list `months_31_days`, which contains the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December).

The program assumes that the input is a valid month number between 1 and 12, as specified in the problem description. Given this assumption, the program will correctly return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. The list `months_31_days` is initialized with the correct month numbers that have 31 days.
2. The `in` operator is used to check if the input `n` is in the `months_31_days` list, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this check.
3. The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the month has 31 days, as required by the problem description.

Since the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible valid inputs correctly, its correctness is **True**.
