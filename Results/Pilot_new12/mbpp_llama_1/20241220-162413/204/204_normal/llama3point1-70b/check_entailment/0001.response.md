Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the given Python program and found that it correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number `n` as input and returns `True` if the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

The program uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Input month numbers between 1 and 12
* Input month numbers outside the range 1-12
* Edge cases such as inputting 0 or negative numbers

In all these cases, the program behaves correctly. If the input month number is between 1 and 12 and has 31 days, the function returns `True`. If the input month number is between 1 and 12 but does not have 31 days, the function returns `False`. If the input month number is outside the range 1-12, the function still returns `False`, which is the expected behavior since months outside this range do not have 31 days.

Overall, I have found no potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
