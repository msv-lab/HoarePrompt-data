Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether a given month number `n` contains 31 days or not. 

It uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. 

The function then checks if the input month `n` is in this list using the `in` operator. If `n` is in the list, the function returns `True`, meaning the month has 31 days. If `n` is not in the list, the function returns `False`, meaning the month does not have 31 days.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to handle cases where `n` is outside the range of 1 to 12. 

For every valid input, the program will return the correct result, meeting the requirements in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
