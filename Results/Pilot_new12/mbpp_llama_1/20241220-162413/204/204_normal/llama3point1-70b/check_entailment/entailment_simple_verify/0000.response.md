Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that checks if the input month number `n` is in the list of months that have 31 days (`months_31_days`).

The annotated version of the code states that the input `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 12, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description. The function then returns `True` if the month `n` has 31 days and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment points out that the function correctly identifies all months with 31 days and handles months that do not have 31 days by returning `False`. The assessment also notes that the function assumes valid month inputs (1 through 12), which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem description.

I agree with the original assessment because the provided code and annotated version support its conclusions. The code accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
