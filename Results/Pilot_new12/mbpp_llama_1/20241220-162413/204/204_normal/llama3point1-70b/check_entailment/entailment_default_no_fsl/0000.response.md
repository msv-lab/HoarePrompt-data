Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle potential edge cases where the input month number is outside the range of 1 to 12. Although the problem description does not explicitly mention what the function should do in these cases, it is implied that the function should only work with month numbers between 1 and 12. However, the function still returns a result for input values outside this range, which can be misleading. For example, if the input month number is 13, the function will return `False`, which might be interpreted as a valid result, but in reality, it's an undefined behavior. 

The output hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking on the input month `n`, so it assumes that `n` is within the range of 1 to 12. This is an indication that the function might not be working correctly for all potential cases. 

To make the code correct, it should either handle these edge cases explicitly or specify in the problem description that the input month number will always be between 1 and 12. 

In the current implementation, an example where the program does not work as expected is when the input month number is 0. The function will return `False`, which might not be the expected behavior for this input. A more correct implementation would be to raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input is invalid.
