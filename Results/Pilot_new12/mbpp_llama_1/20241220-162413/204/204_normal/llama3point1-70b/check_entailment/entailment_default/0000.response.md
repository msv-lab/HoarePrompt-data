Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle the case where the input month `n` is outside the range of 1 to 12. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not, but it does not validate the input month number. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 12, the function will return a result, but it may not be meaningful. For example, if `n` is 0 or a negative number, the function will return `False`, and if `n` is 13 or greater, the function will also return `False`. However, the problem description does not specify what the function should do in these cases. A correct implementation should either validate the input or specify how to handle invalid inputs. 

In this case, the output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function does not perform any error checking on the input month `n`. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**. 

However, if we assume that the input will always be a valid month number between 1 and 12, then the code is correct. But since the problem description does not explicitly state this assumption, we must consider the possibility of invalid inputs, and therefore the correctness of the code is **False**. 

To fix this issue, the code could be modified to validate the input month number and raise an error or return a special value if it is outside the valid range. For example:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not 1 <= n <= 12:
        raise ValueError("Invalid month number")
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
```

This modified version of the function explicitly checks the input month number and raises a `ValueError` if it is outside the valid range, ensuring that the function meets the problem description for every potential case.
