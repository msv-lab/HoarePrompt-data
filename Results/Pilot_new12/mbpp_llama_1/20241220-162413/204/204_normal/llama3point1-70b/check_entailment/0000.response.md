Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1(n)`, checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It does this by defining a list of months that have 31 days (`months_31_days`) and then checking if the input month number `n` is in this list. 

This approach is correct because it accurately identifies all months with 31 days. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which are all included in the `months_31_days` list.

The function is also robust because it implicitly handles months that do not have 31 days by returning `False` for them (since they are not in the `months_31_days` list). It also correctly handles the input validation implicitly, as the condition of being in the list will be `False` for months not listed, implying that the function assumes valid month inputs (1 through 12). 

For all potential month inputs from 1 to 12, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, no potential case of incorrect behavior could be identified within the scope of the given problem description.
