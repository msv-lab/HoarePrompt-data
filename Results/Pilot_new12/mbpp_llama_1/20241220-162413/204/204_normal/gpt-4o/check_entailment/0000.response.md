Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a simple function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number has 31 days. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then checks if the given month is in this set, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function correctly identifies these months as having 31 days.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function, covering various cases including months with 31 days and those without. 

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and there are no edge cases that it does not handle, the program is correct.
