Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function then checks if the input month is in this set, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests cover various cases, including months with 31 days (January, May, and December) and months without 31 days (February, June, and November). The function passes all these tests, which suggests that it is working as expected.

Moreover, the function handles all possible month numbers (1-12) correctly. For example, if we pass a month number outside this range, the function will still return `False`, which is the correct behavior. 

Overall, based on the provided code and unit tests, the function appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
