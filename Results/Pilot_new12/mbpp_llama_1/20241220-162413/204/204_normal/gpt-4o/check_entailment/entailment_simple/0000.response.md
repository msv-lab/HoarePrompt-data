The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, which are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The function takes an integer `month` as input and returns `True` if the month is in the set `months_with_31_days` and `False` otherwise.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. It correctly identifies the months with 31 days and returns the expected result for each test case. The use of a set for storing the months with 31 days ensures efficient lookups, and the function is concise and easy to understand.

The program handles all possible cases correctly because it checks for membership in the set `months_with_31_days`, which contains all months that have 31 days. If the input month is in this set, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that the function produces the correct output for all valid input values.

For example, when the input is 5 (May), the function returns `True` because 5 is in the set `months_with_31_days`. Similarly, when the input is 2 (February), the function returns `False` because 2 is not in the set `months_with_31_days`. This pattern holds for all possible input values, making the program correct according to the problem description.
