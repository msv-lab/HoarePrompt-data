Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days.

The program uses a set `months_with_31_days` to store the months that have 31 days, which are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. The function then checks if the input `month` is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This approach ensures that the function correctly categorizes months based on the number of days they contain, specifically identifying those with 31 days. The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for different input values.

Since we assume that the input will be valid, the program does not need to handle cases where the input month is outside the specified range (i.e., month < 1 or month > 12). The function's primary purpose is to determine whether a given month has 31 days, and it achieves this purpose correctly for all valid input values.
