The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then checks if the input month is in this set, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context and confirms that the function behaves as expected. The state of the program before the function call is clearly defined, and the return statement is correctly annotated. The annotation indicates that the program returns `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment is accurate because it:

1. Correctly identifies the months with 31 days.
2. Verifies that the function passes the provided unit tests.
3. Notes that the function handles all possible month numbers (1-12) correctly.

The annotated version of the code reinforces this assessment by providing a clear and concise explanation of the function's behavior. Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
