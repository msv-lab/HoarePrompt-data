The program checks if the `month` is in the `months_with_31_days` set. The `months_with_31_days` set contains the integers {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}, which represent the months that have 31 days in a year. The `month` variable is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12, meaning it can be any month of the year.

If the `month` is one of the months in the `months_with_31_days` set, the program returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. If the `month` is not in the `months_with_31_days` set, the program returns `False`, indicating that the month does not have 31 days.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and False otherwise (February, April, June, September, November)**
