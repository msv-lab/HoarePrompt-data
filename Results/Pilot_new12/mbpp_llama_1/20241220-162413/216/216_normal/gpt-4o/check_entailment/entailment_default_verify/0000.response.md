Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly checks if a given list of integers is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order when sorted. It handles edge cases such as empty lists and returns False as expected. The code also correctly returns False for lists with non-consecutive integers.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, checking for consecutive integers in ascending order and returning False for lists with non-consecutive integers or non-integer values. Although the function does not explicitly handle lists containing non-integer values, the problem statement assumes that the input is a list of integers, which is a valid assumption.

The original assessment correctly identifies the strengths of the code, including handling edge cases, sorting the list, and efficiently checking for consecutive numbers. The output hints do not provide any evidence to contradict the original assessment, and the code appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and my refined assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
