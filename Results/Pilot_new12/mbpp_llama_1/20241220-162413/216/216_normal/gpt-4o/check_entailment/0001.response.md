Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. After that, it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully checks all pairs without finding any non-consecutive numbers, it returns `True`.

The function seems to handle all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly returns `False` for empty lists.
- It correctly identifies consecutive numbers in lists like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- It correctly identifies non-consecutive numbers in lists like `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`.
- It correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers like `[1, 2, 1]`, returning `False` as expected because the numbers are not consecutive.
- It also works correctly for lists with negative numbers or a mix of positive and negative numbers, as the sorting and subtraction operations will handle these cases correctly.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
