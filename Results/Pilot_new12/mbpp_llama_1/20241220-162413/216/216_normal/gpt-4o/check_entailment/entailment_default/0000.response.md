Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order when sorted. It returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function handles empty lists by returning `False`. The code correctly implements the logic to check for consecutive integers by sorting the list and checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. This handles all potential cases, including lists with duplicate numbers, non-consecutive numbers, and empty lists. The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function. For example, the test `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True` checks for a list with consecutive numbers, and the test `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False` checks for a list with non-consecutive numbers. The test `assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False` checks for a list with duplicate numbers, which is correctly identified as not having consecutive numbers. Overall, the code is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
