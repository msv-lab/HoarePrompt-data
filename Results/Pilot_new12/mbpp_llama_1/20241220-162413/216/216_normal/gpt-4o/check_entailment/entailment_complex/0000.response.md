Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:
- It checks if the input list is empty and returns `False` in this case, which is in line with the problem description.
- It sorts the list in ascending order, which is necessary to check for consecutive numbers.
- It then iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns `False`.
- If it iterates over the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.
- The program assumes that the input will be a list of integers, as specified in the problem description, and does not contain any error checking for non-integer values or non-list inputs. However, according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will always be valid, so this is not a concern.
- The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves correctly for various inputs.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and its annotations and comments provide a clear understanding of its intended behavior.
