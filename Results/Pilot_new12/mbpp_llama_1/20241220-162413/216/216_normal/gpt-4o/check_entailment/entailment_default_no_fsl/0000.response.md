Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first checks if the input list is empty and returns `False` in this case. Then, it sorts the input list in ascending order. Afterward, it iterates over the sorted list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding such a case, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The function handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description:

1. It correctly identifies lists with consecutive integers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. It correctly identifies lists without consecutive integers, such as `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`.
3. It correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers, such as `[1, 2, 1]`, which is not a list of consecutive integers.
4. It correctly handles empty lists by returning `False`.
5. Although not explicitly mentioned in the output hints, the function implicitly handles lists containing non-integer values by potentially producing incorrect results or errors if the list contains non-integer values. However, based on the assumption that the input will always be a valid list of integers, this case is not considered a fail case for the function.

The provided unit tests support this assessment, as they cover several scenarios, including lists with consecutive integers, lists without consecutive integers, and lists with duplicate numbers. Therefore, based on the problem description, output hints, and provided unit tests, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
