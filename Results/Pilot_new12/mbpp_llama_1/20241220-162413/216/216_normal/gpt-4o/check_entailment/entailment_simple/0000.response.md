Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The program first checks if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`, as an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program then sorts the input list `lst` in ascending order and stores it in `lst_sorted`. This is necessary because the problem statement doesn't specify that the input list must be sorted.

3. **Consecutive Number Check**: The program then iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair where the difference is not 1, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

4. **Consecutive Number Confirmation**: If the program completes the iteration without finding any pairs with a difference other than 1, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The program correctly handles all potential cases:

- **Consecutive numbers in any order**: The program sorts the list, so the order of the numbers doesn't matter.
- **Non-consecutive numbers**: The program checks for differences between adjacent numbers and returns `False` if it finds any pair with a difference other than 1.
- **Empty list**: The program returns `False` for an empty list, as it cannot contain consecutive numbers.
- **List with duplicate numbers**: The program will return `False` if the list contains duplicate numbers, as the difference between adjacent numbers will be 0, not 1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and will return the correct result for all valid inputs.
