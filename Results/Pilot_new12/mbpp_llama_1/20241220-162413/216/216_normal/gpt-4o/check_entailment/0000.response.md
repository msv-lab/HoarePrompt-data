Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If the list is empty, it returns False.

Here's why I think the code is correct:
- It handles the edge case of an empty list by returning False.
- It sorts the list to handle cases where the input list is not already sorted.
- It correctly checks for consecutive numbers by verifying that the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1.
- It returns False as soon as it finds a pair of non-consecutive numbers, which makes the function efficient.
- If the function iterates through the entire list without finding any non-consecutive numbers, it returns True, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also suggest that the function behaves correctly in different scenarios. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
