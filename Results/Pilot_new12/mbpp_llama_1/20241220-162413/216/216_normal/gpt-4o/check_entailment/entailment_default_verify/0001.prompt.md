You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function, `func_1`, checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. After that, it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully checks all pairs without finding any non-consecutive numbers, it returns `True`.

The function seems to handle all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly returns `False` for empty lists.
- It correctly identifies consecutive numbers in lists like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- It correctly identifies non-consecutive numbers in lists like `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`.
- It correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers like `[1, 2, 1]`, returning `False` as expected because the numbers are not consecutive.
- It also works correctly for lists with negative numbers or a mix of positive and negative numbers, as the sorting and subtraction operations will handle these cases correctly.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order when sorted. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function handles empty lists by returning `False`. It also correctly identifies lists with non-consecutive integers or lists with non-integer values, returning `False` in such cases. However, it does not explicitly handle lists containing non-integer values, as the input type is assumed to be a list of integers based on the problem statement. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains consecutive integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
