#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers in ascending order, where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)`, or the function returns False if `lst_sorted` is not a list of consecutive integers.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that lst_sorted is a sorted list of consecutive integers in ascending order, where lst_sorted equals sorted(lst)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order when sorted. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function handles empty lists by returning `False`. It also correctly identifies lists with non-consecutive integers or lists with non-integer values, returning `False` in such cases. However, it does not explicitly handle lists containing non-integer values, as the input type is assumed to be a list of integers based on the problem statement. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains consecutive integers.
