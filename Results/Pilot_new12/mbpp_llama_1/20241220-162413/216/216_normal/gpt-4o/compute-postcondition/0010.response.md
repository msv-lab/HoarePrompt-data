Postcondition: ***`lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second and the first elements in `lst_sorted` is not 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no specific action is described.***
