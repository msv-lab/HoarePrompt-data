According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. If `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `lst_sorted` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since the loop condition is `i` in range `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. This means `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 3. However, since we already know `lst_sorted` has at least 3 elements, the condition that `lst_sorted` must have at least 3 elements is already met. But to be precise in the context of the loop's ability to execute one more time, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 4 because `i` needs to be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1` to execute the loop again with `i` being 2. Thus, `lst_sorted` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute one more time with `i` being 2.

State: **`lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and has at least 4 elements, `i` is 2**
