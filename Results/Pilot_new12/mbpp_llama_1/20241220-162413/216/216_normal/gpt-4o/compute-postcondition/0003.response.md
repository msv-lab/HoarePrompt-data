The code creates a new sorted list `lst_sorted` from the original list `lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. `lst_sorted` is a new list containing all elements from `lst`, sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, and the list is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)`**
