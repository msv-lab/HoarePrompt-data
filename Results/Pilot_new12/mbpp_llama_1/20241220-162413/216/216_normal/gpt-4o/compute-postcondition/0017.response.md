Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers is a list of consecutive integers in ascending order when sorted. It accepts a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function handles empty lists by returning `False`. It also correctly identifies lists with non-consecutive integers or lists with non-integer values, returning `False` in such cases. However, it does not explicitly handle lists containing non-integer values, as the input type is assumed to be a list of integers based on the problem statement. The function does not modify the original list and only returns a boolean value indicating whether the list contains consecutive integers.**
