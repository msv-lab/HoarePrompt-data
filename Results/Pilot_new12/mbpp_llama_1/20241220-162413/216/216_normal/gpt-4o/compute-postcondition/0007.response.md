Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in `lst_sorted` is equal to 1**
