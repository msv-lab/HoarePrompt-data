Postcondition: ***`lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and has at least 4 elements, `i` is 2. If `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
