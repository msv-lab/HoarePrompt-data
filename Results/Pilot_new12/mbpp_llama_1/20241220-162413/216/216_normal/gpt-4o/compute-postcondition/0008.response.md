To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty.
- `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 0.
- The difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in `lst_sorted` is equal to 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the indices of `lst_sorted` excluding the last one. 

At the next iteration:
- `i` should be 1 because it was 0 and gets incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- Since `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements and `i` has been incremented to 1, `lst_sorted` must now have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again. This is because with `i` being 1, `i + 1` would be 2, and the loop condition checks up to `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.
- The difference between the element at index `i + 1` (which is now index 2) and the element at index `i` (which is now index 1) in `lst_sorted` should still be considered, but since we are only updating the state based on the iteration condition, the specific difference is not directly relevant to the state update. However, it implies that `lst_sorted` has sequential elements given the context of the problem.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1**
