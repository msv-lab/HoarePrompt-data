To execute the given for loop, we need to ensure that `lst_sorted` has at least two elements. This is because the loop iterates over the range of indices from 0 to the second last index of `lst_sorted`. If `lst_sorted` has less than two elements, the loop will not execute.

Given that `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and `lst` is not empty, we know that `lst_sorted` is also not empty. However, for the loop to execute, `lst_sorted` must have at least two elements.

At the start of the loop, `i` is 0, which is the first index in the range.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
