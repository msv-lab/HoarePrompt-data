Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order where `lst_sorted` equals `sorted(lst)` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. The current value of `lst_sorted[i + 1]` minus the current value of `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, meaning the difference between the second element of `lst_sorted` and the first element of `lst_sorted` is not 1**
