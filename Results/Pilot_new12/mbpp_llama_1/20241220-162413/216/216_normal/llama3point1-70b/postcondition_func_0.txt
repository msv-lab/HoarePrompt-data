The function accepts a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns `True` if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers (i.e., the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and there are no duplicates), and `False` otherwise. The function modifies the original list by sorting it. The function handles edge cases, including empty lists (which would return `True` because the conditions are vacuously true), lists with a single element (which would return `True` if the list is not empty), and lists with duplicate integers (which would return `False`). The function does not handle non-integer or non-list inputs, and may raise an error if the input is not a list of integers.
