Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code correctly checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not. It sorts the list in ascending order and checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1, and also ensures that there are no duplicates in the list. 

The function handles edge cases, including empty lists (which would return `True` because the conditions are vacuously true) and lists with a single element (which would return `True` if the list is not empty). 

The output hints agree with the code, describing the conditions under which the function will return `True` or `False`. 

For example, if the input list is `[4, 2, 1, 3]`, the function will sort the list to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and then check if the differences between adjacent elements are 1, which they are, so it will return `True`. 

Similarly, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the function will sort the list to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, but the presence of duplicates will cause it to return `False`.

Therefore, the code appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, under the assumption that the input will be a valid list of integers.
