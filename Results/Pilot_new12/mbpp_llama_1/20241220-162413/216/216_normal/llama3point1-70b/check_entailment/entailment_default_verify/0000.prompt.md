You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, correctly checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why:

1. The function sorts the list first, which is necessary because the input list may not be in order.
2. It then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list is 1, using a generator expression within the `all()` function. If this condition is true for all pairs, it means that the numbers are consecutive.
3. Additionally, it checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. This ensures that all numbers in the list are unique, which is a necessary condition for the list to contain consecutive numbers.

This function should work correctly for all possible input lists. For example:

- If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `True`.
- If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, the function will return `False`.
- If the input list is `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, the function will return `True` after sorting the list.
- If the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `False` because the list contains duplicates.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, which suggests that it is correct. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns `True` if the sorted list contains consecutive unique integers (i.e., the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and there are no duplicates), and `False` otherwise. The function modifies the original list by sorting it. The function handles edge cases, including empty lists (which would return `True` because the conditions are vacuously true), lists with a single element (which would return `True` if the list is not empty), and lists with duplicate integers (which would return `False`). The function does not handle non-integer or non-list inputs, and may raise an error if the input is not a list of integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
