Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. **Sorting the list**: The program starts by sorting the input list in ascending order using `lst.sort()`. This is a necessary step to check for consecutive numbers, as it ensures that the numbers are in the correct order.

2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The program then uses a generator expression inside the `all()` function to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. This is done using `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the length of the list. If any pair of adjacent numbers has a difference other than 1, the `all()` function will return `False`.

3. **Checking for uniqueness**: The program also checks for uniqueness of numbers in the list using `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`. This condition ensures that there are no duplicate numbers in the list.

4. **Handling edge cases**: The program handles edge cases such as empty lists (which return `True` because the conditions are vacuously true) and lists with a single element (which return `True` if the list is not empty).

5. **Assuming valid input**: As specified, we assume that the input will always be a valid list of integers, so the program does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-integer values.

In summary, the program correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive unique integers or not, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
