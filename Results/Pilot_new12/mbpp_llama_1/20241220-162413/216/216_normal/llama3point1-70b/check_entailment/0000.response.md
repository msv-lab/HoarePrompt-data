Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, correctly checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why:

1. The function sorts the list first, which is necessary because the input list may not be in order.
2. It then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list is 1, using a generator expression within the `all()` function. If this condition is true for all pairs, it means that the numbers are consecutive.
3. Additionally, it checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. This ensures that all numbers in the list are unique, which is a necessary condition for the list to contain consecutive numbers.

This function should work correctly for all possible input lists. For example:

- If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `True`.
- If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, the function will return `False`.
- If the input list is `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, the function will return `True` after sorting the list.
- If the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `False` because the list contains duplicates.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected, which suggests that it is correct. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
