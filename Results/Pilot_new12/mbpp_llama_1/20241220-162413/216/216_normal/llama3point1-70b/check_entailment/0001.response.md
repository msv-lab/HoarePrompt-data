Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. `lst.sort()`: This line sorts the input list in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem description doesn't guarantee that the input list will be sorted.

2. `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))`: This line checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted list is 1. If this condition is met for all pairs of adjacent elements, it means that the list contains consecutive numbers.

3. `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`: This line checks if the list contains any duplicate elements. If the lengths of the list and its set (which removes duplicates) are equal, it means that the list doesn't contain any duplicates.

The function returns `True` only if both conditions are met, meaning that the list contains consecutive numbers without any duplicates.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function will return `True` for an empty list because the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable, and the lengths of an empty list and its set are equal.
- Single-element lists: The function will return `True` for a single-element list because the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable (since there are no pairs of adjacent elements), and the lengths of a single-element list and its set are equal.
- Lists with consecutive numbers: The function will return `True` for lists that contain consecutive numbers without duplicates, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Lists without consecutive numbers: The function will return `False` for lists that don't contain consecutive numbers, such as `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- Lists with duplicates: The function will return `False` for lists that contain duplicate elements, such as `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.
