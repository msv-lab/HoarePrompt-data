Correctness: **True**

The code provided is correct according to the problem description. It checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function `func_1` sorts the list in ascending order and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1 and if there are no duplicates.

Here's why the code works:

- The `lst.sort()` line sorts the input list in ascending order, which is necessary to check for consecutive numbers.
- The `all(...)` function checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent integers is 1, which is the definition of consecutive numbers.
- The `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` check ensures that there are no duplicates in the list.

The code handles edge cases correctly, such as empty lists (which return `True` because the conditions are vacuously true) and lists with a single element (which return `True` if the list is not empty).

Note that, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list of integers. Under this assumption, the code provided is correct and will work as expected.
