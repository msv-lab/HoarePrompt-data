You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. `lst.sort()`: This line sorts the input list in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem description doesn't guarantee that the input list will be sorted.

2. `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))`: This line checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted list is 1. If this condition is met for all pairs of adjacent elements, it means that the list contains consecutive numbers.

3. `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`: This line checks if the list contains any duplicate elements. If the lengths of the list and its set (which removes duplicates) are equal, it means that the list doesn't contain any duplicates.

The function returns `True` only if both conditions are met, meaning that the list contains consecutive numbers without any duplicates.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: The function will return `True` for an empty list because the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable, and the lengths of an empty list and its set are equal.
- Single-element lists: The function will return `True` for a single-element list because the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable (since there are no pairs of adjacent elements), and the lengths of a single-element list and its set are equal.
- Lists with consecutive numbers: The function will return `True` for lists that contain consecutive numbers without duplicates, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Lists without consecutive numbers: The function will return `False` for lists that don't contain consecutive numbers, such as `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- Lists with duplicates: The function will return `False` for lists that contain duplicate elements, such as `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive unique integers and False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
