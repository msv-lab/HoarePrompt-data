To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the program's behavior against the problem's requirements.

The problem description asks for a function that checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. This implies that the function should return `True` if the list can be arranged in such a way that all numbers are consecutive and `False` otherwise.

The provided function, `func_1`, first sorts the input list `lst` to arrange its elements in ascending order. Then, it uses the `all` function in combination with a generator expression to check two conditions:
1. If the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is 1. This ensures that the numbers are consecutive.
2. It also checks if the length of the list `lst` is equal to the length of a set created from `lst`, which ensures that all elements in the list are unique.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the function `func_1` indeed implements a solution to the problem described.

Here's why it works for all potential cases under the assumption of valid inputs:
- Sorting the list ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, which is a prerequisite for checking consecutiveness.
- The `all` function with the generator expression `(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks that each element is one more than its predecessor, which is the definition of consecutive numbers.
- The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` guarantees that there are no duplicates in the list, ensuring that the consecutiveness check is meaningful and accurate.

Therefore, the program does meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs, assuming those inputs are lists of integers without considering edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element. However, based on the strict definitions provided and assuming valid inputs, the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
