Based on the provided information, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not by first sorting the list and then verifying two conditions:

1. The difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted list is 1, indicating consecutive numbers.
2. The list does not contain any duplicates, which is checked by comparing the length of the list and its set (which removes duplicates).

The annotated version of the code also supports the correctness of the original assessment, as it correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.

The only potential concern is the handling of edge cases, such as empty lists or single-element lists. However, as mentioned in the original assessment, the function returns `True` for these cases, which can be considered correct depending on the specific interpretation of the problem.

The original assessment provides a clear and thorough breakdown of how the function works and handles different cases, which suggests that the program is indeed correct.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that the program is correct, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
