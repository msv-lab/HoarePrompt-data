The given code checks two conditions for the list `lst`: 
1. If the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is 1.
2. If all elements in the list are unique, which is ensured by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set created from the list (since sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values).

Given that `lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the first condition checks if the list contains consecutive integers. The second condition checks for uniqueness, which is automatically satisfied if the first condition is true because consecutive integers are unique.

Output State: **The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive unique integers and False otherwise**
