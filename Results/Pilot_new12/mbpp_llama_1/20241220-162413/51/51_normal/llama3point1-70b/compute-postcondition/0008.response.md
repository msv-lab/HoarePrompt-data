To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides that `numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, and `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list. The code snippet is `return product / len(numbers)`.

Given this, the program returns the result of dividing `product` by the length of the `numbers` list. The `product` is the result of multiplying all numbers in the `numbers` list together, and `len(numbers)` gives the total count of numbers in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the product of all numbers in the list divided by the total count of numbers in the list, where the product is the result of multiplying all numbers in the 'numbers' list together.**
