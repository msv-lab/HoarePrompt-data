The given code multiplies the current `product` by `num`, where `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list. The initial state of `product` is not specified in relation to the numbers in the list, but we know that `num` is the second number in the list.

Since `product` is multiplied by `num`, the new value of `product` will be the old value of `product` times `num`. The state of `numbers` remains unchanged as the code does not modify the list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `num` is the second number in the list, `product` is the old `product` value multiplied by `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `num` is the second number in the list, `product` is equal to the old `product` value multiplied by `num`.**
