The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num`. Given that `num` is the third number in the list `numbers` and `product` is equal to its old value, we need to consider how this operation affects the value of `product`.

Since `num` is specified as the third number in the list, its value is determinate based on the list `numbers`. However, without a specific list of numbers provided, we can only describe the relationship between `product`, `num`, and the list `numbers` in general terms.

Before the operation, `product` equals its old value. After the operation, `product` is equal to its old value multiplied by `num`. Thus, the new value of `product` can be expressed as `old_product * num`, where `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`.

The list `numbers` and the fact that it must have at least 3 numbers remain unchanged by this operation, as does the definition of `num` as the third number in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list, `product` is equal to its old value multiplied by `num` (the third number in `numbers`)**
