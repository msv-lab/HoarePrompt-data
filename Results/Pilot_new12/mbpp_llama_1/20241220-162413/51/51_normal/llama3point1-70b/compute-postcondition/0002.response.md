The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by the value of `num`. 
Given the initial state: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is 1, `num` is the first number in the list.
The value of `product` is updated to be the product of its original value (1) and the value of `num` (the first number in the list).
Therefore, the value of `product` becomes `1 * num` which is equal to `num`.
The states of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the list**
