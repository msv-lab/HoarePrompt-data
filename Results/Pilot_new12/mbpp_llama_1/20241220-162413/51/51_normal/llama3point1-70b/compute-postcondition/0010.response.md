Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the geometric mean of a non-empty list of numbers, which is the product of all numbers in the list divided by the total count of numbers. The function accepts a list of numbers (either integers or floats) as input, and the input list remains unchanged. The function does not handle the case where the input list contains zero, which would result in a product of zero. Additionally, the function does not check for the case where the input list contains a very large or very small number, which could result in an overflow or underflow error. The function assumes that the input list is not empty and does not contain non-numeric values. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function will raise an error. The function returns a single number, which is the geometric mean of the input list.**
