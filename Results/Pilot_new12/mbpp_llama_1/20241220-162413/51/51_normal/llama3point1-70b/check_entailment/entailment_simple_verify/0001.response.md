The original assessment indicates that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. However, the annotated version of the code provides additional context that the input list is guaranteed to not be empty, which mitigates this issue.

Given the annotated version's assurance that the input list will not be empty, the original concern about the program's correctness due to potential division by zero is addressed. The function, as provided, does indeed multiply all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which meets the problem description.

Therefore, considering the problem description and the annotated code's guarantees about the input, the program does perform as intended within the scope of its designed use case. The concern raised by the original assessment about the program's inability to handle an empty list is irrelevant under the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers).

Thus, based on the problem description, the annotated code, and the assumption of valid input, the refined assessment of the program's correctness is that it is correct.

Final: **True**
