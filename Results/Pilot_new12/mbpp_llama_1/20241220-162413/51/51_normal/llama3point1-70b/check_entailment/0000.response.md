Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. In this case, the program will raise a ZeroDivisionError when it tries to calculate `product / len(numbers)`, because `len(numbers)` will be zero. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input list contains zero. If the list contains zero, the product will be zero, and the program will return zero. However, this may or may not be the expected behavior, depending on the specific requirements of the problem. If the requirement is to return zero in this case, then the program is correct for this case. But if the requirement is to raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the list contains zero, then the program is incorrect for this case.

Another potential issue is that the program does not check if the input is actually a list of numbers. If the input list contains non-numeric values, the program will raise a TypeError when it tries to multiply these values.

It's also worth noting that the program will return a float value even if all the numbers in the list are integers, because the `/` operator in Python 3 performs floating point division. If the requirement is to return an integer value when the result is an integer, then the program is incorrect. 

To make the program correct, you would need to add error checking code to handle these potential issues. For example:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("Input list must only contain numbers")
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```
