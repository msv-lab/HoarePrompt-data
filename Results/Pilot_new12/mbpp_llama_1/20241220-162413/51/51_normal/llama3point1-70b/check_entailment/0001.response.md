Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function `func_1`, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because it attempts to divide by the length of the list, which is zero. 

The function should check for this edge case and either return a specific value (e.g., `None`) or raise a custom error with a meaningful message. 

For example, the function could be modified to handle this case as follows:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return None  # or raise a custom error
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```
However, without this modification, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, so its correctness is **False**.
