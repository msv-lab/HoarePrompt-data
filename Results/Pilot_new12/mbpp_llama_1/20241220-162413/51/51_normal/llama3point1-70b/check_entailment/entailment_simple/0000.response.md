Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the product of all numbers in the list using a for loop, and then returns the product divided by the length of the list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all numbers in the list.
2. The function then iterates over each number in the input list using a for loop, multiplying the current `product` by each number.
3. After the loop finishes, the `product` variable contains the product of all numbers in the list.
4. Finally, the function returns the `product` divided by the length of the input list, which is obtained using the `len()` function.

This matches the problem description, which requires the function to multiply all numbers in the list and divide the result by the length of the list. The program does not contain any conditional statements or error handling that would affect its correctness, and it assumes that the input will be a non-empty list of numbers, as specified in the problem description.
