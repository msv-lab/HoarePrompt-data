Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the result by the length of the list. The function `func_1` does exactly this:

- It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`, multiplying `product` by each number.
- After calculating the product of all numbers, it returns the result of dividing `product` by the length of the list `numbers`, which is obtained using `len(numbers)`.

Given that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list containing only numbers), the function will always produce the desired result as specified in the problem description. The function correctly calculates the geometric mean of the input list of numbers, which is the product of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers, for every potential valid input case.
