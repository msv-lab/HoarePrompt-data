#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (either integers or floats), and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of all numbers in the list divided by the total count of numbers in the list, where the product is the result of multiplying all numbers in the 'numbers' list together.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the geometric mean of a non-empty list of numbers, which is the product of all numbers in the list divided by the total count of numbers. The function accepts a list of numbers (either integers or floats) as input, and the input list remains unchanged. The function does not handle the case where the input list contains zero, which would result in a product of zero. Additionally, the function does not check for the case where the input list contains a very large or very small number, which could result in an overflow or underflow error. The function assumes that the input list is not empty and does not contain non-numeric values. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function will raise an error. The function returns a single number, which is the geometric mean of the input list.
