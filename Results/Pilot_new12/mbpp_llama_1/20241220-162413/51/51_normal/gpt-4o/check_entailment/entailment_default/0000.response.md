Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality, which is to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the product by the length of the list. This operation is essentially calculating the average of the numbers in the list, but the problem statement specifically asks for the product of the numbers divided by the length, which is exactly what the function does.

The function initializes a variable `product` to 1 and then iterates over each number in the input list, multiplying `product` by each number. After calculating the product of all numbers, it divides `product` by the length of the list to obtain the result.

The provided assertion statements demonstrate the function's correctness with various inputs, including positive and negative numbers, and the output hints explain the function's behavior and limitations. 

The output hints mention the potential risk of a ZeroDivisionError if the input list is empty, but as per the problem's assumptions, we consider only valid inputs, which means the input list will not be empty. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function correctly implements the required functionality for all valid inputs.
