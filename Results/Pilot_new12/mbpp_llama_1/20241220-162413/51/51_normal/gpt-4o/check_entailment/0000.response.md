Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of numbers as input, calculates the product of all numbers, and then divides the product by the length of the input tuple. 

The function handles all potential cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero (although the case where the input tuple contains a zero is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, it would still work correctly because any number multiplied by zero results in zero, and dividing zero by the length of the tuple would still result in zero). 

Additionally, the function does not throw any errors for cases where the input tuple is empty, although this may be considered as an edge case that could potentially be handled differently, depending on the problem's specific requirements. However, mathematically, the product of an empty set is defined as 1, and dividing 1 by the length of an empty tuple (which is 0) would result in a division by zero error. 

In the given implementation, if an empty tuple is passed to the function, a ZeroDivisionError will be raised, because the function attempts to divide by the length of the tuple, which is zero. This might be a potential issue, but it's not explicitly covered in the provided problem description or assertions. 

However, considering only the provided problem description and assertions, the function seems to be working correctly for all potential cases that are described. 

It's also worth noting that the provided assertions use `math.isclose` to compare floating point numbers, which is a good practice because it helps to avoid potential precision issues. 

To make the function more robust, it could include some error checking code to handle potential edge cases such as empty input tuples. But based on the provided information, the function seems to work correctly.
