Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It multiplies all the numbers in the input list and then divides the product by the length of the list, effectively calculating the average of the input numbers. 

The code handles cases where the list contains a mix of integers and floats, and it does not modify the original list. The function's return value represents the average of the input numbers.

The output hints suggest that the function does not include error handling for cases where the input list might be empty or contain zero, which is a valid concern. However, since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases. 

Overall, the code accurately implements the described functionality and works as expected for all valid input cases.
