Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the result by the length of the list. However, the provided function calculates the average of the numbers in the list, which is not the same operation.

The correct operation would involve multiplying all the numbers together and then dividing the result by the length of the list. The provided function does this in the sense that it first calculates the product of all numbers and then divides it by the length of the list, but the result is not what the problem description asks for because it is actually calculating the average, not the product divided by the length.

In other words, the function is doing `(a*b*c) / n` which is the same as `((a+b+c) / n) * (b*c) / (n-1)` for `n>1` which is not the same as `(a*b*c) / n` which is what we would expect if we literally followed the problem description.

However, if we consider the mathematical definition of average, which is the sum of all numbers divided by the count, then in the case of multiplying all numbers together and dividing by the count, the result can be highly variable and not representative of the average of the input list, because the result of the multiplication can be a very large number.

To follow the problem description exactly, the function should still return the result of the product divided by the length, even if the result is not mathematically representative of an average, because the problem statement explicitly asks for this operation, without considering the mathematical implications or the potential result.

However, the function is still doing this product and division, the only difference being that in a comment, it is described as calculating the average of the input numbers. 

But if we strictly interpret the problem description, the provided function actually does what it asks for: it multiplies all numbers in the list and divides the result by the length of the list.

The issue here is more about the interpretation of the problem description and the result of the operation, rather than the function itself not doing what the problem description says.

However, the problem statement clearly says "Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list". And the function provided does exactly this.

Therefore, considering only the mathematical operation described and not its potential results or implications, the function actually does follow the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

However this was initially **False**, because I considered the result and implications of the operation and not just the operation itself.

Considering the strict format and the problem description only, I must change my answer to:

Correctness: **True**
