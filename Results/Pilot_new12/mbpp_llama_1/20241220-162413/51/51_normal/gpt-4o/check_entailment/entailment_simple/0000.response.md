Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the product of all numbers in the input list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all numbers in the list.
2. The function then iterates over each number in the input list using a for loop, multiplying the `product` by each number.
3. After the loop finishes, the `product` variable holds the product of all numbers in the list.
4. The function then calculates the result by dividing the `product` by the length of the input list using the `len()` function.
5. Finally, the function returns the calculated result.

The program correctly handles the assumption that the input list is not empty and does not contain zero, as specified in the problem description. The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input cases.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
