Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the average of all numbers in the input list by first computing the product of all numbers and then dividing it by the total count of numbers. It accepts a list of non-zero numbers (either integers or floats), and the list is expected to be non-empty. The function does not modify the original list, and it handles cases where the list contains a mix of integers and floats. It does not include any error handling for cases where the input list might be empty or contain zero, which could potentially lead to a ZeroDivisionError or incorrect results. The function's return value represents the average of the input numbers, which is equivalent to their product divided by the count of numbers. However, it's worth noting that this approach might not be the most efficient or numerically stable way to calculate the average, especially for large lists or lists with very large or very small numbers.**
