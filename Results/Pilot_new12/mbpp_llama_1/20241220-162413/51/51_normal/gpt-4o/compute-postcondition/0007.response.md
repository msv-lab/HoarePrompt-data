To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code. The loop code multiplies each number in the `numbers` list with the `product` variable.

Given that:
- `numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and is not empty.
- The list does not contain zero.
- `product` is initialized to 1.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe:
- After 1 iteration, `product` equals the first number in `numbers`.
- After 2 iterations, `product` equals the product of the first two numbers in `numbers`.
- After 3 iterations, `product` equals the product of the first three numbers in `numbers`.

This pattern suggests that after all iterations, `product` will be the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list.

Since the list is not empty and does not contain zero, the `product` will always be defined (i.e., it won't be zero unless the list contains a zero, which is excluded by the initial conditions). The loop will execute at least once because the list is not empty.

After the loop finishes, `num` will be the last number in the `numbers` list because it takes the value of each number in the list during each iteration, and after the loop, it retains the value of the last iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, and `num` is the last number in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.**
