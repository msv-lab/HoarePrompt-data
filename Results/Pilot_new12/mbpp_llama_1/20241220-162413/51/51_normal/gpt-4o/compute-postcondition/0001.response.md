According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 1 number, the loop can execute. Since the list is not empty and does not contain zero, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `numbers` is a list of numbers and `product` is 1. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least 1 number and `num` is the first number in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is 1, `num` is the first number in the list**
