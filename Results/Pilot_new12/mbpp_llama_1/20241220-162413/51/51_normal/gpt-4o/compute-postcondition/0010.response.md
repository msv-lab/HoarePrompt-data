The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats, and this list is guaranteed to be not empty and not contain any zeros. After executing the function body, the function returns the average of all numbers in the list, calculated as the sum of the products of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers. 

However, it seems there is an inconsistency in the problem statement regarding the calculation of the average. The average is typically calculated as the sum of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers, not the product of all numbers divided by the total count. Assuming the intention was to describe a standard average calculation (given the context and common mathematical practices), we proceed with that understanding.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-zero numbers and returns their average.**
