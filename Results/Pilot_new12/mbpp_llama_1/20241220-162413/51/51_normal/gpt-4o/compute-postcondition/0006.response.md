The code `product *= num` updates the value of `product` by multiplying it with `num`. Given that `product` is initially equal to `numbers[0] * numbers[1]` and `num` is the third number in the list (`numbers[2]`), the new value of `product` will be `(numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[2]`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 numbers, `product` is equal to `numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[2]`, `num` is the third number in the list**
