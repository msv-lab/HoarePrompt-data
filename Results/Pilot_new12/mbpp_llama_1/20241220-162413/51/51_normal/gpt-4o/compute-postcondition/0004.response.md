The code multiplies the `product` by `num`. Given that `product` is initially equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list and `num` is the second number in the list, we can express the initial `product` as `numbers[0] * numbers[1]` and `num` as `numbers[1]`. 

After the code execution, `product` becomes `(numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[1]`, which simplifies to `numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[1]` or `numbers[0] * (numbers[1] ** 2)`.

Therefore, the `product` is updated, while `numbers` and the condition that `num` is the second number in the list remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `product` is equal to `numbers[0] * (numbers[1] ** 2)`, `num` is the second number in the list**
