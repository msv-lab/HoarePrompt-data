The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num` and assigns the result back to `product`. Given the initial state: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is 1, and `num` is the first number in the list, we can determine the effect of this operation.

Since `product` is initially 1 and `num` is the first number in the list, after the operation, `product` will be equal to the first number in the list (because 1 multiplied by any number is that number itself).

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the list**
