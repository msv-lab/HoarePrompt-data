According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 2 numbers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 numbers and `num` is the second number in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list if the loop body multiplies the product by num, `num` is the second number in the list**
