Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately calculates the area of a rectangle, as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

The program assumes that the inputs will be valid (non-negative numbers), which is a specified condition in the problem description. Given this assumption, the program will always return the correct area of the rectangle.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input might be negative, zero, or non-numeric. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different positive input values.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the assumptions made, the program does what it is supposed to do and is considered correct.
