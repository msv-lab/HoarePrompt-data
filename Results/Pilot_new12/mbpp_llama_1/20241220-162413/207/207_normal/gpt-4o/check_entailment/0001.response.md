Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, which is the standard formula for finding the area of a rectangle. 

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. The function correctly handles different inputs and returns the expected results. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles positive integers correctly, and because the problem description does not specify the input type, it's reasonable to assume the function is designed for positive integer inputs. However, it's also worth noting that the function will work correctly for all numeric inputs (including negative numbers and floating-point numbers), because the mathematical operation of multiplication is defined for these types. 

Therefore, based on the given information, the program is correct.
