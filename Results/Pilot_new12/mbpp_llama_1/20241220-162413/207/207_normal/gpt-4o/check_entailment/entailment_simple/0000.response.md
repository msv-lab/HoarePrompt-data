Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly this: it takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product.

The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description for all potential cases, assuming valid inputs as per the problem's constraints. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(10, 20) == 200`, demonstrate the function's correctness for different input values.

Given that the area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, and this function correctly computes this product for non-negative numbers (as stated in the problem context), it accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
