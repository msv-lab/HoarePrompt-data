Correctness: **False**

The given program calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. However, it does not perform any error checking on the input parameters. According to the problem description, the function should calculate the area of a rectangle, but it does not ensure that the input parameters (length and width) are non-negative numbers. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when either or both of the input parameters are negative. For example, if we call `func_1(-10, 20)`, the function will return `-200`, which is not a valid area for a rectangle. 

Additionally, the function will return zero if either or both of the input parameters are zero, which is mathematically correct but may not be the expected behavior in the context of the problem. However, the main issue here is the lack of error checking for negative numbers. 

The output hints agree with this assessment, stating that the function will return the product of the two numbers regardless of whether they are non-negative or not. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
