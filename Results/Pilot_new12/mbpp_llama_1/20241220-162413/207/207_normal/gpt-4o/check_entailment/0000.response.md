Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function simply returns the product of the length and width, which is the standard formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

The program includes several unit tests that demonstrate its correctness for various input cases. For example, `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is the correct area for a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20. Similarly, `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, and `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, which are also correct.

To verify the correctness of the program, I have considered the following potential cases:

* Positive integers: The program correctly calculates the area for positive integer lengths and widths.
* Zero: The program correctly handles zero-length or zero-width rectangles by returning an area of zero.
* Negative numbers: While the problem description does not explicitly address negative numbers, the program will still produce the correct result in these cases, as the area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, regardless of their signs.
* Non-integer values: The program can handle non-integer lengths and widths, as the `*` operator in Python can multiply floating-point numbers.

After considering these potential cases, I have not found any examples where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
