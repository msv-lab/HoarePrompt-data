You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == 200
assert func_1(10, 5) == 50
assert func_1(4, 2) == 8

def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function simply returns the product of the length and width, which is the standard formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

The program includes several unit tests that demonstrate its correctness for various input cases. For example, `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is the correct area for a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20. Similarly, `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, and `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, which are also correct.

To verify the correctness of the program, I have considered the following potential cases:

* Positive integers: The program correctly calculates the area for positive integer lengths and widths.
* Zero: The program correctly handles zero-length or zero-width rectangles by returning an area of zero.
* Negative numbers: While the problem description does not explicitly address negative numbers, the program will still produce the correct result in these cases, as the area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, regardless of their signs.
* Non-integer values: The program can handle non-integer lengths and widths, as the `*` operator in Python can multiply floating-point numbers.

After considering these potential cases, I have not found any examples where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(10, 20) == 200
assert func_1(10, 5) == 50
assert func_1(4, 2) == 8

#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, which is a non-negative number


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
