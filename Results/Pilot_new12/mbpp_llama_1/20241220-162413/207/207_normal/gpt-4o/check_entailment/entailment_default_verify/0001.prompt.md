You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == 200
assert func_1(10, 5) == 50
assert func_1(4, 2) == 8

def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, which is the standard formula for finding the area of a rectangle. 

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. The function correctly handles different inputs and returns the expected results. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles positive integers correctly, and because the problem description does not specify the input type, it's reasonable to assume the function is designed for positive integer inputs. However, it's also worth noting that the function will work correctly for all numeric inputs (including negative numbers and floating-point numbers), because the mathematical operation of multiplication is defined for these types. 

Therefore, based on the given information, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, length and width, and returns their product. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it will return the product of the two numbers regardless of whether they are non-negative or not. The product can be a negative number if either or both of the input parameters are negative. The function does not modify the input parameters in any way. If either or both of the input parameters are zero, the function will return zero. If the input parameters are not numbers, the function will raise a TypeError. The function's return value can be any number, not just non-negative numbers as the annotations suggest.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
