Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` calculates the product of two numbers, which represents the area of a rectangle if the numbers are non-negative. However, the function does not perform any error checking to ensure that the input parameters are non-negative. According to the output hints, the function will return the product of the two numbers regardless of whether they are non-negative or not, which means it will return a negative number if either or both of the input parameters are negative. 

In the context of finding the area of a rectangle, a negative length or width does not make sense, and the function should ideally return an error or handle this case in a different way. Since the function does not handle this case correctly, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if we call `func_1(-10, 20)`, the function will return `-200`, which is not a valid area for a rectangle. This is a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
