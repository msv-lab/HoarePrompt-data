Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated as the product of its length and width. The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the correct formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

The function's behavior matches the problem description for all valid input cases. Given that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers), the function correctly calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. The annotations in the code also accurately describe the function's behavior, further supporting its correctness.

In summary, the program is correct because it implements the correct mathematical formula for finding the area of a rectangle and behaves as expected for all valid input cases, as defined by the problem description and the assumptions about input validity.
