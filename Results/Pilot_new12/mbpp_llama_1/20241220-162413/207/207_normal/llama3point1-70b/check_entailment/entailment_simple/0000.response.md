Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width` parameters, which is the standard formula for calculating the area of a rectangle.

In this case, since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers), the function will always return a non-negative number, which is the correct result for the area of a rectangle.

The program does not need to handle cases where `length` or `width` are negative numbers or non-numeric values, as the problem description assumes that the input will be valid. Similarly, it does not need to handle cases where `length` or `width` are zero, as the area of a rectangle with zero length or width is indeed zero.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it can be considered correct.
