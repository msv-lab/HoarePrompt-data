Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. This correctly calculates the area of a rectangle, as the area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width.

The function does not contain any conditional statements or loops, so it does not have any potential issues with branching or iteration. It simply performs a straightforward calculation based on the provided inputs.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. It correctly handles positive, negative, and zero values for both length and width, and it works for all possible combinations of these values.

For example, `func_1(4, 5)` returns `20`, which is the correct area of a rectangle with a length of 4 and a width of 5. Similarly, `func_1(-3, 2)` returns `-6`, which is the correct area of a rectangle with a length of -3 and a width of 2.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
