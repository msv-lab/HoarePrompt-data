The initial state indicates that `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers. The given code snippet is `return length * width`. This means the program will return the product of `length` and `width`.

Given that both `length` and `width` are non-negative, their product will also be non-negative. 

Output State: **The program returns the product of length and width, which is a non-negative number resulting from multiplying two non-negative numbers.**
