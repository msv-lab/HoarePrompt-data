#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, which is a non-negative number resulting from multiplying two non-negative numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, length and width, and returns their product. The product is a number resulting from multiplying two numbers. If both length and width are non-negative, the product will also be non-negative. However, if either or both of the input parameters are negative, the product will be negative or zero, respectively. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, and it does not modify the input parameters. The function simply calculates and returns the product of the two input numbers, without considering any specific geometric or spatial interpretation of "length" and "width".
