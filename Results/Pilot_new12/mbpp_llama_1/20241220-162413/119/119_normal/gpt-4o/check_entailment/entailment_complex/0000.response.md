Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The provided program does exactly that. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order as a tuple `(b, a)`. 

This behavior is demonstrated by the provided unit tests:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is the correct output according to the problem description.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, also meeting the requirements.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which again aligns with the expected behavior.

The program's logic is straightforward and matches the problem description. It does not perform any additional operations on the input numbers other than returning them in reversed order, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Since we assume that the input will always be valid (in this case, two numbers), the program does not need to handle cases such as non-numeric inputs, and its simplicity in swapping the order of `a` and `b` is sufficient to meet the specified requirements.
