Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. This directly aligns with the problem description. 

The function `func_1(a, b): return (b, a)` is straightforward and correctly implements the required functionality. It simply returns a tuple with the arguments reversed, which matches the problem description's requirement for every potential case.

The unit tests provided (`assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`, `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`, `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`) also validate the correctness of the function, as they cover different numerical values and validate the function's behavior against the expected output.

Given that the function directly and correctly implements the specified behavior without any apparent edge cases or potential for incorrect output based on the provided and considered information, it is deemed correct.
