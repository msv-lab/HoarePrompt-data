Based on the provided information, the original assessment seems to accurately reflect the correctness of the program. The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The provided code, `func_1(a, b): return (b, a)`, directly implements this functionality.

The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment, as it explains the state of the program before and after the function call, and how the function swaps the positions of the input numbers. The annotations also correctly note that the function assumes the input parameters will always be numbers and does not handle potential edge cases.

One potential point of contention could be the function's lack of input validation, as mentioned in the annotations. However, the problem description does not specify that the function should handle non-numeric inputs, and the provided unit tests only cover numeric inputs. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid, the function's simplicity and lack of error handling do not affect its correctness with respect to the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct still holds true based on the provided information.

Final: **True**
