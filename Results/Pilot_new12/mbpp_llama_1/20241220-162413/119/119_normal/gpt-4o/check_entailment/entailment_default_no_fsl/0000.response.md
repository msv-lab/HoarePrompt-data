Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This operation effectively swaps the positions of the input parameters. The problem description specifically asks for a function that "takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number." Given that we are assuming valid inputs (i.e., numbers) will be provided, the function behaves exactly as described in the problem.

The code is simple and straightforward, directly addressing the requirement without any unnecessary complexity. It does not attempt to handle edge cases such as non-numeric inputs because, as per the instructions, we assume that only valid (numeric) inputs will be used.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further support the correctness of the function, showing that it works as expected for various numeric inputs. There are no indications from the output hints or the problem description that suggest the function should behave differently under any specific conditions, assuming valid inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the assumptions provided, the code does what it is supposed to do and handles every potential case correctly, given that the inputs are valid numbers.
