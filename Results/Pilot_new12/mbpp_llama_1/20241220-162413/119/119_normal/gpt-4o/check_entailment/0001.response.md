Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the problem description's requirements. It takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The function's simplicity and direct approach to swapping the order of the input numbers make it correct for all potential cases.

The function works by directly returning a tuple where the second input `b` is the first element, and the first input `a` is the second element, which exactly matches the problem description. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm the function behaves as expected for different numerical inputs.

Given the straightforward nature of the function and the lack of any conditional logic or potential error-prone operations (like division by zero, out-of-range values, etc.), it's reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for all valid numerical inputs. Without being able to find a specific case where the function does not work as described, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
