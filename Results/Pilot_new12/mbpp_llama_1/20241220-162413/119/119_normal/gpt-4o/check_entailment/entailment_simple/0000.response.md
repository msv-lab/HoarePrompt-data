Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

In the given annotated program, the function `func_1` takes in two parameters `a` and `b`, which are numbers. The function then returns a tuple containing `b` and `a` in that order. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected. For example, `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is the correct result according to the problem description.

Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., two numbers), the function will always return the correct result, and therefore, it is correct. There are no edge cases or potential errors that would cause the function to deviate from the problem description.
