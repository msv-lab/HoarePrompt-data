The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. The provided function `func_1` meets the problem description's requirements by taking two numbers as input and returning a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The function's simplicity and direct approach to swapping the order of the input numbers, as described in the original assessment, are accurately reflected in the code.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it confirms the straightforward nature of the function. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call, indicating that the function does indeed swap the positions of `a` and `b` without any modifications or validations. Given that the problem description and the function's implementation align perfectly, and assuming valid inputs will always be provided (as stated), there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect.

The annotated code reinforces the original assessment by detailing the function's behavior step by step, showing that it simply returns `b` and `a` in that order, which matches the problem description. The annotations also touch upon potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs, overflow, or underflow, but as these are not part of the problem description or expected input validation, they do not affect the program's correctness in the context provided.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated code, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
