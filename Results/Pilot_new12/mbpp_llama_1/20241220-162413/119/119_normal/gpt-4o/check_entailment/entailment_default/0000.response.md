Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the function described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second, effectively swapping their positions. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns `b` and `a` in that order without any modifications or validation. Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., two numbers), the function does not need to handle edge cases such as non-numeric inputs.

The code is straightforward and simple, and it correctly implements the desired behavior. The function does not perform any operations that could potentially fail or produce incorrect results, so it is correct for all potential cases.
