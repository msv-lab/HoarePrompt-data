#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns `b` and `a`, where both `b` and `a` are numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers, and returns both `b` and `a` in that order, effectively swapping their positions. The function does not perform any validation or modification on the input parameters, so it assumes that `a` and `b` will always be numbers. The function's return values are the original `b` and `a`, without any changes or operations applied to them, except for the swapping of their return order. This simple swap operation does not handle any potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs, overflow, or underflow, as these are not accounted for in the provided code. After the function concludes, the state of the program will have `b` and `a` returned, with `b` first and `a` second, regardless of their original order or values.
