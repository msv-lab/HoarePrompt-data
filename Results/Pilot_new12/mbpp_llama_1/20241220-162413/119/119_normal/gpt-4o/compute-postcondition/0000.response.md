The program returns two values, `b` and `a`. Given that `a` and `b` are numbers, we don't have specific values for them, so we can't perform any calculations. However, we know that the program returns these two numbers in reverse order of how they were initially stated.

Output State: **The program returns `b` and `a`, where both `b` and `a` are numbers.**
