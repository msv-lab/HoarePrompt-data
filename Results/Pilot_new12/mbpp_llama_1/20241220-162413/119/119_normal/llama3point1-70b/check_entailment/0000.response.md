Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a simple function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to return `(b, a)`, which meets the problem description.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. There are no edge cases that the function does not handle correctly.

For example, if you call `func_1(1, 2)`, the function will return `(2, 1)`, which is the expected output. Similarly, if you call `func_1(-1, 0)`, the function will return `(0, -1)`, which is also the expected output.

Since the function works correctly for all potential cases, and there are no edge cases that it does not handle correctly, the program is considered correct.
