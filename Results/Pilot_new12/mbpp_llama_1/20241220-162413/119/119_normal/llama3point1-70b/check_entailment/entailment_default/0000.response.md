Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The output hints agree with the code, describing a function that swaps the positions of the input numbers and returns them as a tuple. Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code does not need to perform error checking or handling. The function simply returns the swapped values, fulfilling its purpose as described by the overall postcondition. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the code, and it seems to work correctly for every potential case as described in the problem description.
