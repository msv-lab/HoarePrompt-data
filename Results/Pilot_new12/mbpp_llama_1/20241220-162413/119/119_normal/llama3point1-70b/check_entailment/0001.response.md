Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function that returns a tuple containing the second input number followed by the first input number.

Upon examining the code, it's clear that it handles this task correctly for any two input numbers. There are no conditional statements or loops that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior based on different inputs. The function simply and consistently returns a tuple with the inputs reordered as required.

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 10)`, it will return `(10, 5)`, which is the expected behavior. This consistency across all potential numerical inputs, without any exception or edge case that would cause the function to deviate from the problem description, confirms the correctness of the program.
