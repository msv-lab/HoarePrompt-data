Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

In Python, when you use the `return` statement with multiple values separated by commas, it automatically returns a tuple with those values. So, `return b, a` returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which is the desired output.

Since the program correctly handles the input and returns the expected output for all valid inputs, and we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, the program is correct according to the problem description.
