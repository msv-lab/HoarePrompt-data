Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing the second number `b` and then the first number `a`, effectively swapping their positions.

The annotated comments in the program also accurately describe its behavior. The function does not perform any error checking or handling, but since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., two numbers), this is not a concern.

In every potential case, the program will return a tuple containing the second input number followed by the first input number, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Therefore, the program is correct and will always produce the desired output for valid inputs.
