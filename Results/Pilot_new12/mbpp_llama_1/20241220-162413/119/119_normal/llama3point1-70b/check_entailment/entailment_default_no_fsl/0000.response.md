Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a simple function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, effectively swapping their positions. The problem description asks for a function that performs this exact operation, and the provided code fulfills this requirement. 

The code does not include any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, but as per the instructions, it is assumed that the input will always be valid (i.e., two numbers). Therefore, within the context of this assumption, the code performs its intended task correctly for every potential valid case.

The function works by directly returning a tuple `(b, a)`, which is the expected output according to the problem description. Since it does not modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside the function scope, and it does not need to handle any edge cases regarding the input type (as those are assumed to be valid), the provided code meets the requirements laid out in the problem description for all valid inputs.
