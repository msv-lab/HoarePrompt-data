The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers, and returns a tuple containing `b` and `a` in that order, effectively swapping the positions of the input numbers. This function does not perform any error checking or handling for cases where `a` and `b` might not be numbers, nor does it modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside the function scope. It simply returns the swapped values, fulfilling its purpose as described by the overall postcondition.
