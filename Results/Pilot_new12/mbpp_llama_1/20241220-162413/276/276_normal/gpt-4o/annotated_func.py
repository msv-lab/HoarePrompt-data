#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, `mid` is `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, `median` is `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of list1 and list2, which are the (n-1)th and nth elements of merged_list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of equal length `n`, and a positive integer `n`, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the length of the merged list is even, or the middle number if the length of the merged list is odd. After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows: `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single number representing the median of the merged list. The function handles both even and odd length merged lists, and it assumes that `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order and have the same length `n`.
