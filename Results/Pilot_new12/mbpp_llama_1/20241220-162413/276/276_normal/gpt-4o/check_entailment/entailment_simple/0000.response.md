Correctness: **True**

The program provided meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks for a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
2. The provided function, `func_1`, takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and an integer `n` as input, where `n` represents the size of each list.
3. The function merges the two input lists into a single list, `merged_list`, and sorts it in ascending order.
4. It then finds the middle index of the `merged_list` using integer division (`mid = len(merged_list) // 2`).
5. If the length of `merged_list` is even (i.e., the total number of elements in both lists is even), the function calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements (`(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`).
6. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, the function returns the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`) as the median.

This implementation correctly handles both cases for finding the median of a merged list of two sorted lists of the same size. The function's logic aligns with the standard definition of the median for both even and odd-length datasets.

The provided assertions (`assert` statements) further validate the function's correctness by testing it with specific input cases and verifying that the output matches the expected median values. 

Therefore, the program does what the problem description asks for in every potential case, assuming valid input as per the problem statement.
