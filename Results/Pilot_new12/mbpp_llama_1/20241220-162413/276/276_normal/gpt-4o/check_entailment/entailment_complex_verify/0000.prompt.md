You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It first merges the two lists into one and sorts it. Then it calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. 

The function handles both cases where the length of the merged list is even and odd correctly. When the length is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. When the length is odd, it takes the middle number as the median.

The function also correctly handles the case where the input lists are of the same size, as specified in the problem description.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, in the case of `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`, the merged and sorted list would be `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`, and the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which are 15 and 17, resulting in a median of 16.0, as expected.

Overall, the function correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, `mid` is `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, `median` is `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of list1 and list2, which are the (n-1)th and nth elements of merged_list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of equal length `n`, and a positive integer `n`, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the length of the merged list is even, or the middle number if the length of the merged list is odd. After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows: `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single number representing the median of the merged list. The function handles both even and odd length merged lists, and it assumes that `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order and have the same length `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
