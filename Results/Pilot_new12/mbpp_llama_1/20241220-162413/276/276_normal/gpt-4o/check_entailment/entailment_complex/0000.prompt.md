You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, `mid` is `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, `median` is `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of list1 and list2, which are the (n-1)th and nth elements of merged_list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of equal length `n`, and a positive integer `n`, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the length of the merged list is even, or the middle number if the length of the merged list is odd. After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows: `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single number representing the median of the merged list. The function handles both even and odd length merged lists, and it assumes that `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order and have the same length `n`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
