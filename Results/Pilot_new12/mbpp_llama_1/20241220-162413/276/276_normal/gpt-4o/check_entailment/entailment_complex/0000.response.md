Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Merging the lists**: The program merges the two input lists `list1` and `list2` into a single list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order. This is done using the `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list.

2. **Calculating the median**: The program then calculates the median of the `merged_list`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number. This is done using the `mid` variable to find the index of the middle number(s).

3. **Handling even and odd length lists**: The program correctly handles both even and odd length merged lists. The `if-else` block checks whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd and calculates the median accordingly.

4. **Returning the median**: The program returns the calculated median as a single number.

The program assumes that the input lists are sorted in ascending order and have the same length `n`, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description. It also assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, which is also a valid assumption.

The provided assertions also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different input cases. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
