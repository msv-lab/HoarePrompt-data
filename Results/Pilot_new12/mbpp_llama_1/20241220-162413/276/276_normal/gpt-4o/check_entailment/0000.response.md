Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It first merges the two lists into one and sorts it. Then it calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. 

The function handles both cases where the length of the merged list is even and odd correctly. When the length is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. When the length is odd, it takes the middle number as the median.

The function also correctly handles the case where the input lists are of the same size, as specified in the problem description.

The unit tests provided also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, in the case of `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`, the merged and sorted list would be `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`, and the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which are 15 and 17, resulting in a median of 16.0, as expected.

Overall, the function correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness.
