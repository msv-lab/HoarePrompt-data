Correctness: **True**

The code meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function `func_1` merges the two lists, sorts them, and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. 

The function handles both even and odd length merged lists correctly by checking the remainder of the division of the length of the merged list by 2. If the length is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, it returns the middle number.

All the provided unit tests pass, and the code handles the cases where the length of the merged list is both even and odd. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists of different lengths. 

The output hints agree with the code, and the function does indeed return the correct median for the given examples. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
