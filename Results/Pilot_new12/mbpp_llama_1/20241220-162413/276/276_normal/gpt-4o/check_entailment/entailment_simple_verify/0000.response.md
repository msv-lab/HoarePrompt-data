Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The assessment provides several examples of how the function works, including the case where the length of the merged list is even and the case where the length of the merged list is odd.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment. The annotations provide a detailed description of the state of the program at different points, including the state of the input lists, the merged list, and the median. The annotations confirm that the function correctly merges the two input lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median.

The key point to note is that the function assumes that the input lists are of the same size, and the problem description specifies that the lists are of the same size. The function also correctly handles the case where the length of the merged list is even, calculating the median as the average of the two middle numbers, and the case where the length of the merged list is odd, taking the middle number as the median.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
