The original assessment states that the provided function `func_1` calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size correctly. The problem description asks to write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to correctly calculate the median of the merged list. It first merges the two lists into one and sorts it. Then it calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the state of the program at different points. The annotations indicate that the function correctly handles both even and odd length merged lists and returns the average of the two middle numbers if the length is even, or the middle number if the length is odd.

However, the annotated version also mentions that the function assumes that `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order and have the same length `n`. The problem description does indeed specify that the input lists are sorted and of the same size.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, in the case of `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`, the merged and sorted list would be `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`, and the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which are 15 and 17, resulting in a median of 16.0, as expected.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

Final: **True**
