Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct for finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. The function first merges the two input lists and sorts the resulting list, which is necessary because the median of two sorted lists can be found by considering all elements together in sorted order.
2. It then calculates the middle index of the merged list.
3. If the total number of elements is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
4. If the total number of elements is odd, it takes the middle element as the median.

The provided unit tests support this correctness by checking various scenarios with different lists and confirming that the function returns the expected median values.

However, it's worth noting that the problem description states the lists are of the same size, but the function provided also takes the length `n` as a parameter and does not explicitly check if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal to `n` or to each other. Despite this, the functionality for calculating the median given the merged list is correct. 

Given the strict problem description and the code's behavior, since the function does calculate the median correctly for merged lists and the assertion tests provided do not reveal any incorrect behavior for the described scenario (even though the lists being the same size isn't explicitly checked within the function), the code behaves as expected under the given problem description and test cases.
