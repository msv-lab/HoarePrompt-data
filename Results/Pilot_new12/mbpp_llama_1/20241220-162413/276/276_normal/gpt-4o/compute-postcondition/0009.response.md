Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, of equal length `n`, and a positive integer `n`, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the length of the merged list is even, or the middle number if the length of the merged list is odd. After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows: `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single number representing the median of the merged list. The function handles both even and odd length merged lists, and it assumes that `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order and have the same length `n`.**
