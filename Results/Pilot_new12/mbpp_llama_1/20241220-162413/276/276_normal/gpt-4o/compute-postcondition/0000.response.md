The code merges `list1` and `list2` into a single list and sorts it in ascending order, assigning the result to `merged_list`. The lengths of `list1` and `list2` are both `n`, and both lists are sorted in ascending order.

`merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `n` are not affected. 

The value of `merged_list` is a list of `2n` numbers, and it is sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`**
