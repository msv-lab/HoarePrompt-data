To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The given code is `mid = len(merged_list) // 2`. 

The value of `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers, equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`. Since `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of `n` numbers, the length of `merged_list` is `2n`. 

So, `len(merged_list)` is equal to `2n`. 

Then, `mid = len(merged_list) // 2` is equal to `mid = 2n // 2`, which simplifies to `mid = n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, and `mid` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, and `mid` is equal to `n`**
