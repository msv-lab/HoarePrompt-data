Postcondition: **`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, and the current value of `mid` is `n`. The length of `merged_list` is even, meaning the length of `merged_list` is divisible by 2 with no remainder.**
