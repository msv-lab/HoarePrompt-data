The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements. Since the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements at indices `mid - 1` and `mid`. 

Given that `mid` is `n`, the median is calculated as the average of `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`. 

The value of `median` is assigned the result of this calculation, which is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, `mid` is `n`, and `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of `n` numbers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of `2n` numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, `mid` is `n`, and `median` is `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.**
