To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet. The initial state provides information about two sorted lists, `list1` and `list2`, each containing `n` numbers, where `n` is a positive integer. It also defines `merged_list` as a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`, resulting in a list of `2n` numbers. The variable `mid` is set to `n`, and the `median` is defined based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd.

Given that `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, its length is `2n`, which is always even because `n` is a positive integer and multiplying any positive integer by 2 results in an even number. Therefore, the `median` calculation will always follow the rule for even-length lists: `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.

The code snippet simply returns the `median`. Since `merged_list` is always of even length due to its construction from two lists of equal length `n`, the returned `median` will be the average of the two middle numbers in `merged_list`, specifically `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`.

Output State: **The program returns the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of list1 and list2, which are the (n-1)th and nth elements of merged_list.**
