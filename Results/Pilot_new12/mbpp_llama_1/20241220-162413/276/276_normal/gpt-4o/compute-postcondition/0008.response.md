The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and `n` is a positive integer. The constraints specify that the length of both `list1` and `list2` is equal to `n`, and both lists are sorted in ascending order. After executing the function body, it returns the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of numbers `list1` and `list2` of equal length `n`, and a positive integer `n`, and return the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list.

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers list1 and list2 of equal length n, and a positive integer n, and returns the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged list.**
