Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function merges two sorted lists of the same size into a single sorted list, calculates the median, and returns it. The median is correctly calculated as the average of the two middle values if the total length of the merged list is even, or as the middle value if the total length is odd.

The function assumes that the input lists are of the same length and that this length is a positive integer, which is in line with the problem description. The function also does not modify the original input lists, as stated in the output hints.

Although the function does not check for invalid input, such as empty lists, lists of different lengths, or non-integer values, the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid allow us to consider the function correct.

The key point to note is that the problem description specifies the function should work for two sorted lists of the same size, and the provided function does exactly that, calculating the median correctly for all valid inputs as per the given constraints.
