Correctness: **False**.

The given Python function `func_1` attempts to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, there are a couple of issues with the implementation.

1. The function does not check if the input lists are indeed sorted, which is a crucial assumption for the median calculation.

2. More importantly, when calculating the median for lists of even size, the function uses `size - 1` as the `middle_index`. However, since Python uses zero-based indexing, this would be incorrect for lists of even size. The correct index for the first element of the pair that forms the median in an even-sized list would be `size - 1`, but considering the list is merged and sorted, we need to find the middle index which would be `size * 2 // 2` since we are merging two lists, not just one list of size `size`. The middle indices should be `size * 2 // 2 - 1` and `size * 2 // 2`.

Here's an example where the program fails: 

Let `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, and `size = 2`. The merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, if we use the given function, `middle_index = size - 1 = 1`, which would result in an incorrect median calculation.

A corrected version of the function should consider these points:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
