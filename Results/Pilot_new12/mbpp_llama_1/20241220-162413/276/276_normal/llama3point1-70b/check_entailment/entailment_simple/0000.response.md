To verify the correctness of the given Python program with respect to the problem description, we need to ensure that it accurately finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

The problem description asks for a function to calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided function, `func_1`, merges these two lists into a single sorted list and then attempts to find the median based on whether the total length of the merged list is even or odd.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The function correctly merges `list1` and `list2` into `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order. This is in line with the problem description's requirement for handling two sorted lists.

2. **Calculating the Median**:
   - For an even total length, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. In the function, when `size` (which represents the length of one of the input lists) is even, the total length of `merged_list` is `2*size`, which is also even. However, the function calculates the median using `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, where `middle_index` is `size - 1`. Since `size` is the length of one list and the merged list has a length of `2*size`, the correct indices for the two middle numbers should be `size - 1` and `size`, not `size - 1` and `size` (because `size` is not necessarily the correct index for the second middle number in the merged list of length `2*size`). The correct approach should consider the total length of the merged list, which is `2*size`.
   - For an odd total length, the median is the middle number. Since the total length of `merged_list` is `2*size` (an even number), there is no case where the total length is odd when considering two lists of the same size. Thus, the condition for calculating the median when `size` is odd is not applicable here because the merged list's length (`2*size`) will always be even.

3. **Indexing Error**: The critical issue lies in the indexing. When `size` is even, the function should calculate the median using the values at indices `size - 1` and `size` in the merged list. However, given that `size` refers to the length of one list and the merged list has a length of `2*size`, the correct indices for the two middle values in the sorted merged list should actually be `size` and `size + 1` (not `size - 1` and `size`), considering `size` as the length of one of the original lists and thus `size` being the middle index of the first half of the merged list.

Given the above analysis, the function does not correctly implement the calculation of the median for two sorted lists of the same size because it incorrectly identifies the indices for the median calculation. The function should instead use `size` and `size + 1` as the indices for the two middle numbers when the total length is even (which it always is, given two lists of the same size), considering the total length of the merged list is `2*size`.

Correctness: **False** 

The reason for this verdict is the mistake in calculating the median indices. The function should calculate the median using `merged_list[size]` and `merged_list[size + 1]` when `size` (the length of one of the lists) is even, because `size` and `size + 1` are the correct indices for the two middle numbers in the merged list of length `2*size`. The given implementation does not correctly calculate the median according to the problem description due to this indexing error.
