You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given Python function `func_1` attempts to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, there are a couple of issues with the implementation.

1. The function does not check if the input lists are indeed sorted, which is a crucial assumption for the median calculation.

2. More importantly, when calculating the median for lists of even size, the function uses `size - 1` as the `middle_index`. However, since Python uses zero-based indexing, this would be incorrect for lists of even size. The correct index for the first element of the pair that forms the median in an even-sized list would be `size - 1`, but considering the list is merged and sorted, we need to find the middle index which would be `size * 2 // 2` since we are merging two lists, not just one list of size `size`. The middle indices should be `size * 2 // 2 - 1` and `size * 2 // 2`.

Here's an example where the program fails: 

Let `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, and `size = 2`. The merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, if we use the given function, `middle_index = size - 1 = 1`, which would result in an incorrect median calculation.

A corrected version of the function should consider these points:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), merges them into a single sorted list (`merged_list`), calculates the median of the `merged_list`, and returns it. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle values if the total length of the merged list is even, or as the middle value if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`). The function assumes that the input lists are of the same length (`size`) and that `size` is a positive integer. The function does not check for invalid input, such as empty lists, lists of different lengths, or non-integer values. The function's return value is a single number representing the median of the merged list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
