Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` is designed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It first merges these lists into a single sorted list, then calculates the median based on whether the total length of the merged list is even or odd.

The function takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are the two sorted lists, and `size`, which is their common length. It calculates the median correctly for both even and odd total lengths of the merged list. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Merging the Lists: The function correctly merges the two input lists into a single list using the `+` operator, which concatenates the two lists, and then sorts this merged list using the `sorted()` function.

2. Calculating the Median: 
   - If the total length of the merged list (which is `size * 2`) is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values. The function correctly identifies these middle values and calculates their average.
   - If the total length of the merged list is odd, the median is the middle value. The function correctly identifies this middle value.

The output hints agree with the code and describe the function's behavior accurately. They mention that the function does not check for invalid input, but since we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., two non-empty lists of the same length containing integers), this does not affect the function's correctness for the problem as described.

Therefore, based on the given code and output hints, and assuming valid input, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size for every potential case.
