Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the median of the merged list. The problem lies in the calculation of the middle index. When the total length of the merged list is even, the program correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle values. However, when the total length is odd, the program incorrectly calculates the median as the value at index `size - 1`, which is one position before the actual middle index.

The correct middle index for the merged list should be calculated as `2 * size // 2` or `size` (since the merged list has a length of `2 * size`), not `size - 1`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size
    if (2 * size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

Alternatively, you can also use the following code to calculate the median:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

This way, the code correctly calculates the median of the merged list, regardless of its length being even or odd.
