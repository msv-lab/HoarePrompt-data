You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

A potential case where this program fails is when the two input lists have the same size but differ in the total length after merging. The issue arises from the calculation of the `middle_index`. In the given code, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect because `size` refers to the size of one of the input lists, not the size of the merged list.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which has a size of 4. However, the `middle_index` calculated by the program will be `1`, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation should calculate the `middle_index` based on the size of the merged list, which is `2 * size`. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
Alternatively, the function can be simplified as:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    n = len(merged_list)
    median = (merged_list[n//2 - 1] + merged_list[n//2]) / 2 if n % 2 == 0 else merged_list[n//2]
    return median
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), merges them into a single sorted list (`merged_list`), calculates the median of the `merged_list`, and returns it. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle values if the total length of the merged list is even, or as the middle value if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`). The function assumes that the input lists are of the same length (`size`) and that `size` is a positive integer. The function does not check for invalid input, such as empty lists, lists of different lengths, or non-integer values. The function's return value is a single number representing the median of the merged list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
