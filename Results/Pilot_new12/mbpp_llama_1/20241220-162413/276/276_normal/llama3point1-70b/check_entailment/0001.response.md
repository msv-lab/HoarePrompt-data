Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

A potential case where this program fails is when the two input lists have the same size but differ in the total length after merging. The issue arises from the calculation of the `middle_index`. In the given code, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect because `size` refers to the size of one of the input lists, not the size of the merged list.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which has a size of 4. However, the `middle_index` calculated by the program will be `1`, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation should calculate the `middle_index` based on the size of the merged list, which is `2 * size`. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
Alternatively, the function can be simplified as:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    n = len(merged_list)
    median = (merged_list[n//2 - 1] + merged_list[n//2]) / 2 if n % 2 == 0 else merged_list[n//2]
    return median
```
