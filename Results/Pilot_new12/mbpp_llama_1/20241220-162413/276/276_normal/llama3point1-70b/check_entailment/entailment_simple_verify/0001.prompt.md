You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

A potential case where this program fails is when the two input lists have the same size but differ in the total length after merging. The issue arises from the calculation of the `middle_index`. In the given code, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect because `size` refers to the size of one of the input lists, not the size of the merged list.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which has a size of 4. However, the `middle_index` calculated by the program will be `1`, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation should calculate the `middle_index` based on the size of the merged list, which is `2 * size`. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
Alternatively, the function can be simplified as:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    n = len(merged_list)
    median = (merged_list[n//2 - 1] + merged_list[n//2]) / 2 if n % 2 == 0 else merged_list[n//2]
    return median
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) == len(list2).
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list` values at indices `size - 1` and `size`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the value of `merged_list` at index `size`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is either the average of the values at indices size - 1 and size if size is even, or the value at index size if size is odd, where size is the length of list1 or list2.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
