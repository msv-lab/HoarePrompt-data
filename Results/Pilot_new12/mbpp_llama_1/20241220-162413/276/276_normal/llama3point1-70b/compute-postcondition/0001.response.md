The code assigns the value of `size - 1` to the variable `middle_index`. The value of `size` is a positive integer and is equal to the length of `list1` and `list2`. The states of the other variables, including `list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, and `middle_index` is `size - 1`.**
