The value of `merged_list` is assigned the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order, the combined and sorted list will also be in ascending order. The lengths of `list1` and `list2` are the same and equal to `size`, so the length of `merged_list` will be twice the `size`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`.**
