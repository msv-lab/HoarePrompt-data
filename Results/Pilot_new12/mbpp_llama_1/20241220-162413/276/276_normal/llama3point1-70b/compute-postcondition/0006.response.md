Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list` values at indices `size - 1` and `size`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the value of `merged_list` at index `size`.***
