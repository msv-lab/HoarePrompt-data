The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by averaging the two middle elements. Given that `middle_index` is `size - 1` and `size` is even, `middle_index + 1` is `size`. 

Since `merged_list` has a length of `2 * size`, the middle elements are indeed at indices `size - 1` and `size`. 

The value of `median` becomes the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive even integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive even integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2**
