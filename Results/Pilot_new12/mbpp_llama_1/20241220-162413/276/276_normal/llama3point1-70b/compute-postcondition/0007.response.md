To determine the output state, let's break down the information given and the impact of the code `return median`.


Given that `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, and `size` equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`, we know `size` is a positive integer. The `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of `2 * size`. The `middle_index` is defined as `size - 1`.


The `median` calculation depends on whether `size` (which is also the length of `merged_list` divided by 2) is even or odd. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of the `merged_list` values at indices `size - 1` and `size`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is the value of `merged_list` at index `size`.


Since `return median` is executed, the program returns the calculated `median`. This `median` is either the average of two middle values in `merged_list` when `size` is even or the middle value itself when `size` is odd.


Output State: **The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is either the average of the values at indices size - 1 and size if size is even, or the value at index size if size is odd, where size is the length of list1 or list2.**
