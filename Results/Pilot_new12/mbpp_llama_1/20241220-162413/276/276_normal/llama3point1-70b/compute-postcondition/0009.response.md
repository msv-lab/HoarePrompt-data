Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), merges them into a single sorted list (`merged_list`), calculates the median of the `merged_list`, and returns it. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle values if the total length of the merged list is even, or as the middle value if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`). The function assumes that the input lists are of the same length (`size`) and that `size` is a positive integer. The function does not check for invalid input, such as empty lists, lists of different lengths, or non-integer values. The function's return value is a single number representing the median of the merged list.**
