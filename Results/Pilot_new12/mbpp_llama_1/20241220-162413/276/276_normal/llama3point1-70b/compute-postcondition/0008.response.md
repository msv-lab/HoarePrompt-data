The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length. `size` is a positive integer such that `size` equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`. After executing the function body, the function returns the median of the merged list of `list1` and `list2`. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle values if the total length of the merged list is even, or the middle value if the total length is odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers and their common length, and returns the median of the merged list.**
