Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive even integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, and the current value of `middle_index` is `size - 1`.**
