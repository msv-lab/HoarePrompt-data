#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) == len(list2).
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, and are of the same length, `size` is a positive integer such that `size` == `len(list1)` == `len(list2)`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with length `2 * size`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list` values at indices `size - 1` and `size`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the value of `merged_list` at index `size`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is either the average of the values at indices size - 1 and size if size is even, or the value at index size if size is odd, where size is the length of list1 or list2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`size`), merges them into a single sorted list (`merged_list`), calculates the median of the `merged_list`, and returns it. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle values if the total length of the merged list is even, or as the middle value if the total length is odd. The function does not modify the original input lists (`list1` and `list2`). The function assumes that the input lists are of the same length (`size`) and that `size` is a positive integer. The function does not check for invalid input, such as empty lists, lists of different lengths, or non-integer values. The function's return value is a single number representing the median of the merged list.
