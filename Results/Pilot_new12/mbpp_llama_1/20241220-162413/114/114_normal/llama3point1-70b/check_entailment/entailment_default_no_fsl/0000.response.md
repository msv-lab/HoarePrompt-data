Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.

The function handles all potential edge cases as described in the output hints:

- It accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input parameters.
- It returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, regardless of the type of `elem` or the elements in `tup`, as long as `elem` can be compared with the elements of `tup`.
- It handles an empty tuple, returning 0 if `elem` is not present.
- It handles a tuple with duplicate elements, correctly counting their occurrences.
- It handles a tuple with no occurrences of `elem`, returning 0.
- It does not modify the input tuple `tup` or the element `elem`.
- Its return value is an integer representing the count of `elem` in `tup`.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and that the function correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem description, the code is correct for every potential case.
