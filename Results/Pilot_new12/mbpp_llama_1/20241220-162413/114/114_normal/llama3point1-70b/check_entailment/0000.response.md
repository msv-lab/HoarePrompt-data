Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses the built-in `count` method of tuples in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element. This method works correctly for all potential cases, including when the element is not present in the tuple (in which case it returns 0), when the element is present multiple times, and when the tuple is empty.

For example, if we have the tuple `(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)` and we want to count the occurrences of the element `3`, the function `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3), 3)` will return `3`, which is the correct count.

Additionally, the function handles cases where the tuple is empty or where the element is not present in the tuple. For instance, `func_1((), 1)` will return `0`, and `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` will also return `0`, both of which are the correct counts.

Overall, the program is correct because it uses a built-in method that is designed to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
