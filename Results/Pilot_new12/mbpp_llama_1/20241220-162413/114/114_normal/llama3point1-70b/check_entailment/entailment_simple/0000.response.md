To determine the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, let's analyze what the problem description requires and compare it with what the function does.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in a tuple and an element, and then counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple.

The provided function `func_1(tup, elem)` uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This method returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., `tup` will indeed be a tuple, and `elem` will be an element that can be compared with the elements of `tup`), the function directly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

- It accepts a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`).
- It returns the count of `elem` in `tup` using `tup.count(elem)`, which is the exact functionality required by the problem description.

Therefore, the function is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality without any deviations or omissions for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
