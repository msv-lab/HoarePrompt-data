Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment that the program is correct appears to be accurate.

The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input parameters and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases such as an empty tuple, a tuple with duplicate elements, and a tuple with no occurrences of `elem`, and returns the correct count.

The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which is a straightforward and efficient way to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function does not modify the input tuple `tup` or the element `elem`, and its return value is an integer representing the count of `elem` in `tup`, as specified in the problem description and output hints.

The original assessment already considered various test cases, including tuples with duplicate elements, empty tuples, and tuples with no occurrences of the element, and found that the function behaves correctly in all these cases. The output hints do not provide any new information that would contradict the original assessment.

Therefore, the original assessment is maintained, and the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
