Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. This is achieved by utilizing the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple. 

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that it fails to handle. It works for tuples containing elements of any data type, and it correctly handles the case where the element is not present in the tuple (in which case it returns 0). 

For example, the following test cases demonstrate the function's correctness:
- `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), 2)` returns 2, as expected.
- `func_1((1, 1, 1, 1), 1)` returns 4, as expected.
- `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` returns 0, as expected.
- `func_1((), 1)` returns 0, as expected, handling the case of an empty tuple.

Since the function correctly implements the required functionality for all potential inputs, it can be considered correct.
