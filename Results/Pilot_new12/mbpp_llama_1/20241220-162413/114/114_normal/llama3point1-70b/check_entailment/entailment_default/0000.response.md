Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. 

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that it handles all potential edge cases, including an empty tuple, a tuple with duplicate elements, and a tuple with no occurrences of the element. The function does not modify the input tuple or the element and returns an integer representing the count of the element in the tuple.

Since the `count` method is a standard method in Python and is designed to handle all these edge cases correctly, the function is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs. The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program also supports the correctness of the function. 

In general, the function should work correctly for any tuple and any element, regardless of their type, as long as they can be compared. For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2)` and `elem = 2`, the function should return `3`, which is the correct count of `2` in `tup`. If `tup = ()` and `elem = 2`, the function should return `0`, which is also correct. 

Therefore, based on the code, the output hints, and the problem description, the function `func_1` is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
