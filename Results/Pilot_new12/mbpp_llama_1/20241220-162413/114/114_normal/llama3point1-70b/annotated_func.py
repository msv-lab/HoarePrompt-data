#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is any type of element that can be compared with the elements of the tuple.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the number of occurrences of 'elem' in tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input parameters, and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`, regardless of the type of `elem` or the elements in `tup`, as long as `elem` can be compared with the elements of `tup`. The function handles all potential edge cases, including an empty tuple, a tuple with duplicate elements, and a tuple with no occurrences of `elem`, in which case it returns 0. The function does not modify the input tuple `tup` or the element `elem`, and its return value is an integer representing the count of `elem` in `tup`.
