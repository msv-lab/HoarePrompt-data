Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` does what the problem description says it should do: it counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple, handles cases where the element is not present, correctly counts multiple occurrences, and works with any comparable object.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function, demonstrating its behavior with different inputs.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a tuple and a comparable element), the function is correct and will work as expected in every potential case. The code is concise, readable, and takes advantage of Python's built-in functionality, making it a straightforward and effective solution to the problem.
