Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem asks to write a Python function that takes a tuple and an element as input and counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that. It utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

Here are the key points that demonstrate the program's correctness:

1. **Function signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `element` (any comparable object). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting occurrences**: Inside the function, `tup.count(element)` is used to count the occurrences of the `element` in the tuple `tup`. This is the core requirement of the problem description.

3. **Return value**: The function returns an integer representing the count of the `element` in the tuple. If the `element` is not found in the tuple, it correctly returns 0.

4. **Handling edge cases**: Although the problem statement assumes valid input, the function inherently handles cases where the tuple is empty (returning 0 for any `element`) and where the `element` appears multiple times in the tuple (correctly counting all occurrences).

5. **Type flexibility**: The function works with any type of object that can be compared with the elements of the tuple, including integers, strings, and other tuples, as demonstrated by the problem description and the function's comments.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases where the input is valid, as assumed by the problem statement.
