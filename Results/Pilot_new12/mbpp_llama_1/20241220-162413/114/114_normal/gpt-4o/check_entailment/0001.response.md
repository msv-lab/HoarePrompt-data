Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The `func_1` function takes in a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of the element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Counting occurrences of an element that is present in the tuple (e.g., `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10)` returns `3`).
- Counting occurrences of an element that is not present in the tuple (e.g., `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4)` returns `0`).

After analyzing the code, no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The `count` method is a standard and reliable way to count occurrences of an element in a tuple, and the function implements it correctly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
