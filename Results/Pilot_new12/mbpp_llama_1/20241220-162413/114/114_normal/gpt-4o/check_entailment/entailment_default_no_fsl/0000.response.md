Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The function handles various cases as described in the output hints:

- It correctly counts multiple occurrences of an element.
- It returns 0 when the element is not present in the tuple.
- It works with any type of object that can be compared with the elements of the tuple.
- It returns 0 when the tuple is empty, regardless of the value of the element.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, and there are no apparent cases where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for a variety of inputs.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., `tup` is indeed a tuple and `element` is a comparable object), the function should work correctly for every potential case.
