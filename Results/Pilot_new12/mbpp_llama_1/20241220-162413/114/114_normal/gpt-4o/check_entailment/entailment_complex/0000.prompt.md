You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and element is any type of object that can be compared with the elements of the tuple.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`, where `tup` is a tuple and `element` is any type of object that can be compared with the elements of the tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`. It does not modify the original tuple or element, and its return value is an integer representing the count. The function handles cases where `element` is not present in `tup` by returning 0, and it also correctly counts multiple occurrences of `element` in `tup`. Additionally, it works with any type of object that can be compared with the elements of the tuple, including but not limited to integers, strings, and other tuples. If `tup` is empty, the function will return 0, regardless of the value of `element`. The function assumes that `tup` is indeed a tuple and `element` is a comparable object, but it does not perform any explicit checks for these conditions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
