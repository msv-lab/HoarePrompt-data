Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element. 

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including when the element is present in the tuple (as demonstrated by the provided unit tests) and when the element is not present in the tuple. 

For example, `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4)` returns 0, which is correct because the element 4 is not present in the tuple.

The function also handles cases where the element is present multiple times in the tuple, as shown by `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10)` returning 3 and `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8)` returning 4.

Since the function behaves as expected in all tested cases and no edge cases can be identified where the function would fail to produce the correct count, the program is considered correct.
