Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns the count of the occurrences of the `element` in the `tup`.

The function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. This directly fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for different scenarios:

1. When the element is not present in the tuple (e.g., `4`), the function correctly returns `0`.
2. When the element is present multiple times in the tuple (e.g., `10`), the function correctly returns the number of occurrences (`3`).
3. When the element is present multiple times in the tuple (e.g., `8`), the function correctly returns the number of occurrences (`4`).

Given that the input will always be valid, the function is correct and will always produce the expected output according to the problem description.
