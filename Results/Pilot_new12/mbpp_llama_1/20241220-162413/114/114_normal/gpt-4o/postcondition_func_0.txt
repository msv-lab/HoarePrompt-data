The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`. It does not modify the original tuple or element, and its return value is an integer representing the count. The function handles cases where `element` is not present in `tup` by returning 0, and it also correctly counts multiple occurrences of `element` in `tup`. Additionally, it works with any type of object that can be compared with the elements of the tuple, including but not limited to integers, strings, and other tuples. If `tup` is empty, the function will return 0, regardless of the value of `element`. The function assumes that `tup` is indeed a tuple and `element` is a comparable object, but it does not perform any explicit checks for these conditions.
