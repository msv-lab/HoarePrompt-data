Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to add the given tuple to the given list. The function `func_1` does exactly this by converting the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenating it with the original list using the `+` operator.

The function returns a new list that combines all elements from `lst` and `tpl`, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves correctly for different input cases.

In particular, the line `return lst + list(tpl)` is the key to the correctness of the function. By converting the tuple `tpl` to a list using `list(tpl)`, the function can concatenate it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator, which is the standard way to concatenate lists in Python.

Since the problem description assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does not need to handle edge cases such as empty lists or tuples, or non-list/tuple inputs. Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and the provided unit tests.
