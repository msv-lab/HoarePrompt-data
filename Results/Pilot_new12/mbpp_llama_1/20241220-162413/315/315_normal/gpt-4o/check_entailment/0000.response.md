Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input and returns a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the tuple. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple (after converting the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`), which is a valid and efficient way to achieve this in Python.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. Additionally, the function handles different data types and sizes of the input list and tuple.

To further verify the function's correctness, let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Empty list and tuple**: `func_1([], ())` returns `[]`, which is the expected result.
2. **List with a single element**: `func_1([1], (2, 3))` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
3. **Tuple with a single element**: `func_1([1, 2], (3,))` returns `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
4. **Large list and tuple**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (6, 7, 8, 9, 10))` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, which is correct.

After considering these cases, it appears that the function behaves as expected and correctly adds the given tuple to the given list. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
