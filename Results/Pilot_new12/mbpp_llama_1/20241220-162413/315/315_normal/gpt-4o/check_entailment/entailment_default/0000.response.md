Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` is designed to add the elements of a tuple to the end of a list. The function takes two parameters, `lst` and `tpl`, which represent the input list and tuple, respectively. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list with the tuple converted to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then returns the resulting list.

The code correctly handles all potential cases, including non-empty lists and tuples, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function can handle edge cases such as empty lists or tuples.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list and a tuple), the function does not need to include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs. The function's return value is a new list containing all elements from both the input list and tuple, in the order they appeared in the original list and tuple, which matches the problem description.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the desired behavior and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
