Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly add the given tuple to the given list. It takes in a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates it to the end of the original list using the `+` operator. This operation returns a new list containing all elements from both the input list and tuple, in the order they appeared in the original list and tuple.

The function handles all potential edge cases such as empty lists or tuples as demonstrated by the output hints. For example, if the input list is empty and the tuple is non-empty, the function will return a list containing only the elements from the tuple. Similarly, if the input tuple is empty and the list is non-empty, the function will return the original list.

The function does not modify the original input variables and treats all elements as simple values to be combined, regardless of their type. It assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., a list and a tuple, and does not include any error checking to handle cases where the input is not of the expected type.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases and the output hints agree with the code, the correctness of the program is **True**.
