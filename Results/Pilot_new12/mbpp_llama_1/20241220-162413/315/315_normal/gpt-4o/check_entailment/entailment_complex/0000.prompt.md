You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
assert func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]
assert func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a list that is a combination of all elements from `lst` and `tpl`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function combines all elements from the input list (`lst`) and tuple (`tpl`) into a single list, handling all potential edge cases such as empty lists or tuples, and returns this combined list. The function accepts two parameters, a list and a tuple, and performs no modifications to the original input variables. After execution, the function's return value is a new list containing all elements from both the input list and tuple, in the order they appeared in the original list and tuple. The function does not differentiate between the types of elements in the list and tuple, treating all elements as simple values to be combined. In cases where the input list or tuple is empty, the function returns a list containing only the elements from the non-empty input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
