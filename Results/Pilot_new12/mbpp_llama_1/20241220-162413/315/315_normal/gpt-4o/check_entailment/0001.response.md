Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to add a given tuple to a given list. It achieves this by converting the tuple into a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenating it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. This operation returns a new list that includes all elements from both the original list and the tuple.

The function handles this operation correctly for all potential cases because the `+` operator in Python, when used with lists, concatenates the two lists and returns a new list. The `list(tpl)` conversion works for any tuple `tpl`, regardless of its length or the types of its elements.

The unit tests provided further demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs. For example, `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` correctly returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, showing that the function adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list as expected.

Given the simplicity and generality of the function, along with the absence of any identified edge cases that would cause it to fail, it's reasonable to conclude that the function behaves as intended for all potential inputs.
