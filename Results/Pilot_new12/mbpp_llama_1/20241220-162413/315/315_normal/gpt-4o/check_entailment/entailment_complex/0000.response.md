Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to add a given tuple to a given list. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes two parameters, `lst` (a list) and `tpl` (a tuple), which directly aligns with the problem description's requirement to accept a list and a tuple.

2. **Combining Elements**: Inside `func_1`, the expression `lst + list(tpl)` effectively combines all elements from `lst` and `tpl` into a single list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the problem description mentions handling potential edge cases such as empty lists or tuples, it's implied that we assume valid inputs. However, even without explicit handling, the function naturally handles empty inputs correctly because in Python, concatenating an empty list or tuple with another list does not change the resulting list. For example, `[] + [1, 2]` returns `[1, 2]`, and `[1, 2] + []` also returns `[1, 2]`.

4. **No Modification of Original Inputs**: The function returns a new list without modifying the original `lst` or `tpl`. This behavior is consistent with the problem description's requirement that the function performs no modifications to the original input variables.

5. **Order of Elements**: The function preserves the order of elements as they appeared in the original list and tuple. This is because list concatenation in Python preserves the order of elements.

6. **Return Value**: The function's return value is indeed a new list containing all elements from both the input list and tuple, which meets the problem description's requirements.

Therefore, the given Python program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description, and it does so for all potential valid input cases.
