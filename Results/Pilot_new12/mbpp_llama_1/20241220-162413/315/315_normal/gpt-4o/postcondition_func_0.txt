The function combines all elements from the input list (`lst`) and tuple (`tpl`) into a single list, handling all potential edge cases such as empty lists or tuples, and returns this combined list. The function accepts two parameters, a list and a tuple, and performs no modifications to the original input variables. After execution, the function's return value is a new list containing all elements from both the input list and tuple, in the order they appeared in the original list and tuple. The function does not differentiate between the types of elements in the list and tuple, treating all elements as simple values to be combined. In cases where the input list or tuple is empty, the function returns a list containing only the elements from the non-empty input.
