Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an `input_list` and an `input_tuple` as parameters. The function converts the `input_tuple` to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenates it to the `input_list` using the `+` operator. This results in a new list containing all elements from both the `input_list` and the `input_tuple`, which is then returned.

The code correctly handles lists and tuples of any length and content, including empty lists and tuples. It does not modify the original `input_list` or `input_tuple`. The order of elements in the returned list is determined by the order of elements in the original `input_list` and `input_tuple`, with all elements from the `input_list` appearing before all elements from the `input_tuple`.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a detailed description of its behavior. There are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code is simple and straightforward, making it unlikely to have any hidden bugs or edge cases that would cause it to fail.

Assuming that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list and a tuple), the code should work correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
