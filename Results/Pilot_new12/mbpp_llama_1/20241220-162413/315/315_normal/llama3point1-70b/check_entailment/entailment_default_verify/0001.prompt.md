You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description because it converts the tuple to a list before adding it to the input list. As a result, the output will be a list containing all elements of the input list and the tuple, but the tuple will be broken down into individual elements, rather than being added as a single element. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of the expected `[1, 2, (3, 4)]`. 

To fix this, the function should simply append the tuple to the list using the `append` method, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Alternatively, the function could use the `+` operator with a list containing the tuple, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + [input_tuple]
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters, combines them into a single list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it to the original list, and returns the resulting list containing all elements from both the input list and the input tuple. The function handles lists and tuples of any length and content, including empty lists and tuples, and does not modify the original input list or tuple. The order of elements in the returned list is determined by the order of elements in the original list and tuple, with all elements from the list appearing before all elements from the tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
