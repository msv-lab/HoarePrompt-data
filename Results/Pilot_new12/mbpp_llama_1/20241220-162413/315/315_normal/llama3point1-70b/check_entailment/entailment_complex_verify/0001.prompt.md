You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description because it converts the tuple to a list before adding it to the input list. As a result, the output will be a list containing all elements of the input list and the tuple, but the tuple will be broken down into individual elements, rather than being added as a single element. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of the expected `[1, 2, (3, 4)]`. 

To fix this, the function should simply append the tuple to the list using the `append` method, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Alternatively, the function could use the `+` operator with a list containing the tuple, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + [input_tuple]
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a list that contains all elements from the original input_list and all elements from the original input_tuple
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters, combines them into a single list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it to the original list, and returns the resulting list containing all elements from both the input list and the input tuple. The function handles lists and tuples of any length and content, including empty lists and tuples, and does not modify the original input list or tuple. The order of elements in the returned list is determined by the order of elements in the original list and tuple, with all elements from the list appearing before all elements from the tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
