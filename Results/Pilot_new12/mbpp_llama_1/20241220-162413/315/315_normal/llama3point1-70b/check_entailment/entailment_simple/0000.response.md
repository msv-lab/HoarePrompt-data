Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it returns a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the tuple, but it does not add the tuple to the original list. The problem description requires the function to add the given tuple to the given list, which implies a modification of the original list. 

In the provided program, the function returns a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the tuple, but it does not modify the original list. It treats the tuple as a collection of individual elements and adds them to the list, rather than adding the tuple itself as a single element.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]` and the input tuple is `(4, 5, 6)`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, but the original list will remain `[1, 2, 3]`. If the function were to add the tuple to the list, it would return `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5, 6)]`.

To meet the problem description, the function should be modified to append the tuple to the list, like this:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
