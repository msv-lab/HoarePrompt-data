Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program is supposed to add the given tuple to the given list, but it actually converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it to the original list. This means that the tuple itself is not added to the list, but rather its elements are.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], (4, 5))`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, but the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]` because the problem statement specifies that the tuple should be added to the list, not its elements.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

This function appends the tuple to the list as expected, maintaining the tuple as a single element in the list.
