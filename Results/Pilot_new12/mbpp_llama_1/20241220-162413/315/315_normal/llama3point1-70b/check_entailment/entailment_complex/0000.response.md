To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze what the problem description asks for and compare it with what the program actually does.

The problem description states: "Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list."

The annotated program provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as parameters. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the tuple converted to a list.

Now, let's compare this with the problem description:

1. **The Function Accepts a List and a Tuple as Parameters:** The function `func_1` correctly accepts a list and a tuple as parameters.
2. **Combines Them into a Single List:** By converting the tuple to a list (`list(input_tuple)`) and then concatenating it to the original list (`input_list + list(input_tuple)`), the function correctly combines the input list and tuple into a single list.
3. **Returns the Resulting List Containing All Elements from Both the Input List and the Input Tuple:** The function returns a new list containing all elements from the input list followed by all elements from the input tuple, which matches the requirement.
4. **Handles Lists and Tuples of Any Length and Content:** The function can handle lists and tuples of any length (including empty lists and tuples) and content because the operations used (`list()` for conversion and `+` for concatenation) work with any length and type of elements within the list and tuple.
5. **Does Not Modify the Original Input List or Tuple:** The function returns a new list and does not modify the original input list or tuple, which aligns with the description.

Given these points, the program as described does what the problem description asks for. It correctly adds the given tuple to the given list by creating a new list that contains all elements from both the original list and the tuple, without modifying the originals, and it handles lists and tuples of any length and content.

Therefore, based on the assumptions that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list and a tuple as expected by the function) and the function's behavior as described, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
