Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description because it converts the tuple to a list before adding it to the input list. As a result, the output will be a list containing all elements of the input list and the tuple, but the tuple will be broken down into individual elements, rather than being added as a single element. 

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of the expected `[1, 2, (3, 4)]`. 

To fix this, the function should simply append the tuple to the list using the `append` method, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Alternatively, the function could use the `+` operator with a list containing the tuple, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + [input_tuple]
```
