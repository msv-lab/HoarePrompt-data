Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as parameters, combines them into a single list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it to the original list, and returns the resulting list containing all elements from both the input list and the input tuple. 

This function handles lists and tuples of any length and content, including empty lists and tuples, and does not modify the original input list or tuple. The order of elements in the returned list is determined by the order of elements in the original list and tuple, with all elements from the list appearing before all elements from the tuple.

For example, if we have a list `[1, 2, 3]` and a tuple `(4, 5, 6)`, the function will return the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. If we have an empty list `[]` and a tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, the function will return the list `[1, 2, 3]`. If we have a list `[1, 2, 3]` and an empty tuple `()`, the function will return the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since the problem description does not specify any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, and we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function is correct for every potential case.
