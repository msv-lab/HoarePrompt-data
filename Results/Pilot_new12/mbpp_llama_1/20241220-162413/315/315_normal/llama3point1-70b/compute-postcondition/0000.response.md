The code converts the input_tuple to a list and then concatenates it with the input_list. Since input_list is a list and input_tuple is a tuple, the program returns a new list that contains all elements from input_list and all elements from input_tuple.

Output State: **The program returns a list that contains all elements from the original input_list and all elements from the original input_tuple**
