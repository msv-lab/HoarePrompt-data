The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters, combines them into a single list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it to the original list, and returns the resulting list containing all elements from both the input list and the input tuple. The function handles lists and tuples of any length and content, including empty lists and tuples, and does not modify the original input list or tuple. The order of elements in the returned list is determined by the order of elements in the original list and tuple, with all elements from the list appearing before all elements from the tuple.
