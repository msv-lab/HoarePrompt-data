The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and based on the problem description and the provided code, it makes sense. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists as input and return a list of the first elements of each sublist. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` effectively achieves this by iterating over each sublist in the input list and extracting the first element.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding by stating that the program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in 'lst', where 'lst' is a list of lists. This annotation aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Given that we assume the input to the program will be valid and not cause any errors, the potential issues mentioned in the original assessment, such as handling empty sublists or non-list inputs, are not considered problems in this context. The function is designed to operate under the assumption of valid input, and it correctly implements the described functionality within these constraints.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program's correctness is maintained as **True** because it accurately implements the functionality of returning the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists, assuming valid input.

Final: **True**
