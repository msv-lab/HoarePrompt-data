Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it successfully retrieves the first element of each sublist in the input list. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates over each sublist in the input list and selects the first element of each sublist. 

The function handles lists of lists with any number of sublists and any number of elements in each sublist. It also returns an empty list if the input list is empty, which aligns with the expected behavior. 

Although the output hints mention potential issues with the code, such as raising an 'IndexError' if a sublist is empty or not handling cases where the input is not a list of lists, these are not considered incorrect behavior in this context because we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs. Therefore, based on the problem description and the code, the function appears to be correct.
