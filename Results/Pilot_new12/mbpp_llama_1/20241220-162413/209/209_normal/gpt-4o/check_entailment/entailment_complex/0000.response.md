Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description. It takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `lst` and extract the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist. This approach ensures that the function handles lists of lists with any number of sublists and any number of elements in each sublist.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of non-empty lists), the function will always return the correct result. The problem description does not specify how to handle empty sublists or invalid input, and since we assume the input will be valid, this implementation is correct.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further demonstrate the correctness of the function by testing it with various inputs and verifying that the output matches the expected result. 

Therefore, since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs, it is considered correct.
