Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input and returns a list of the first elements of each sublist. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

The code is correct because it handles the task as described in the problem statement for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **List of Lists with Variable-Length Sublists**: The function correctly handles lists of lists where each sublist can have a different length. For example, `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]` returns `[1, 3, 6]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.

2. **Sublists with Different Data Types**: Although not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, the function will work with sublists containing different data types (e.g., strings, integers, floats) because it simply returns the first element of each sublist without performing any operation that depends on the type of the element.

3. **Empty Sublists**: The function will raise an `IndexError` if it encounters an empty sublist because it tries to access the first element (`sublist[0]`) without checking if the sublist is empty. This could be considered a potential issue, but based on the provided assertions and the problem description, it's implied that the input list of lists contains non-empty sublists.

4. **Edge Cases**: The only edge case that might cause the function to fail is an empty input list. However, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]` in such a case because the list comprehension will simply not iterate over any sublists.

To make the function more robust, one might consider adding error handling for cases like empty sublists or non-list inputs. However, based on the information provided, the function seems to correctly implement the described functionality.
