Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for lists of sublists with varying lengths, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

The code correctly handles the following scenarios:

- It returns the first element of each sublist, regardless of the length of the sublists.
- It works with lists containing sublists of different lengths.
- It does not attempt to access elements that do not exist, which would lead to index errors.

Since the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and passes the provided unit tests without any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, it can be considered correct.
