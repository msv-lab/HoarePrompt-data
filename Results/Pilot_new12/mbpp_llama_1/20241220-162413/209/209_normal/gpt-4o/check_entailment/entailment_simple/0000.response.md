Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that returns the first element of each sublist in a given list of lists.

The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst`. For each sublist, it selects the first element (`sublist[0]`) and adds it to the output list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` correctly returns `[1, 3, 6]`, which are the first elements of each sublist.
- `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` correctly returns `[1, 4]`, the first elements of each sublist.
- `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` correctly returns `[9, 1]`, the first elements of each sublist.

Since the function behaves as expected for all provided test cases and its logic is sound (selecting the first element of each sublist), it can be concluded that it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
