The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If a sublist is empty, an 'IndexError' will be raised because the code attempts to access the first element (at index 0) without checking if the sublist is empty. The function does not modify the original list of lists. It handles lists of lists with any number of sublists and any number of elements in each sublist, but it does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
