#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in 'lst', where 'lst' is a list of lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If a sublist is empty, an 'IndexError' will be raised because the code attempts to access the first element (at index 0) without checking if the sublist is empty. The function does not modify the original list of lists. It handles lists of lists with any number of sublists and any number of elements in each sublist, but it does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
