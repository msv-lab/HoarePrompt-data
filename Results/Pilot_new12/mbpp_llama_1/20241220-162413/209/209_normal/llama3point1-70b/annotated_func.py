#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in 'sublists'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists (sublists) as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist. If a sublist is empty, it will raise an IndexError when trying to access the first element. The function does not modify the original input list or its sublists. It handles sublists of varying lengths and returns a list of the same length as the input list, with each element being the first element of the corresponding sublist. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function assumes that all elements in the input list are lists themselves and does not include any error checking for non-list elements.
