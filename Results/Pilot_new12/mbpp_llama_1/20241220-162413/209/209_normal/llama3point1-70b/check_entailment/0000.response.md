Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If a sublist is empty, attempting to access its first element (`sublist[0]`) will result in an `IndexError`. 

For example, if the input is `[[], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, the program will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of the first sublist. 

To handle this case, the program could add a check to ensure that each sublist is not empty before attempting to access its first element. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```
