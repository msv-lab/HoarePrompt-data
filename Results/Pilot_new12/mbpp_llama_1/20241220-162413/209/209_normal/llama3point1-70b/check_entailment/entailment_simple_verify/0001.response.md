The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. This assessment makes sense because if a sublist is empty, trying to access its first element (`sublist[0]`) will indeed raise an `IndexError`. 

However, considering the problem description and the annotated version of the code, it is stated that the input to the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. This implies that the sublists will not be empty, as an empty sublist would cause an error.

Based on this information, the original assessment no longer applies, because the scenario where a sublist is empty is not supposed to occur according to the assumptions made about the input.

The annotated version of the code also supports the correctness of the program, as it describes the state of the program right before the function call as "sublists is a list of lists" and states that the program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in 'sublists'.

Therefore, considering the assumptions made about the input, the program does meet the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
