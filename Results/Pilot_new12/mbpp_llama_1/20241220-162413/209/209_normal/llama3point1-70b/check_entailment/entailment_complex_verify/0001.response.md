The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where a sublist is empty, which would cause an `IndexError`. However, the annotated version of the code states that the function assumes all elements in the input list are non-empty lists and does not include any error checking for empty lists. 

Given the problem description, which is to write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist, and the assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of non-empty lists), the program actually meets the requirements. The original assessment is based on a scenario (empty sublists) that is outside the assumed valid input.

The annotated version clarifies the program's behavior and assumptions, indicating that it indeed returns the first element of each sublist, as long as the sublists are not empty. Since we are assuming the input will always be valid (non-empty sublists), the potential `IndexError` mentioned in the original assessment is not a concern.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, the refined assessment is that the program is correct under the assumption of valid input (non-empty sublists).

Final: **True**
