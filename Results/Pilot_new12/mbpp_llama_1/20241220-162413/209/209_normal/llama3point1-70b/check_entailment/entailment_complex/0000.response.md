Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists `sublists` as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description states that the function should accept a list of lists, and the annotated program assumes that all elements in the input list are lists themselves. Since we assume that the input will always be valid, this assumption does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Functionality**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extracts the first element (`sublist[0]`). This meets the requirement of returning a list containing the first element of each sublist.

3. **Empty Input Handling**: If the input list is empty, the list comprehension will simply return an empty list, which is the expected behavior according to the annotated program.

4. **Varying Sublist Lengths**: The function can handle sublists of varying lengths because it only extracts the first element of each sublist, regardless of its length.

5. **Non-Modification of Original List**: The function does not modify the original input list or its sublists, as it returns a new list containing the first elements of each sublist.

However, it's worth noting that the annotated program mentions that if a sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element. But according to the problem description, the task is to write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist. There is no mention of handling empty sublists. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the assumption of valid input, the program is correct.
