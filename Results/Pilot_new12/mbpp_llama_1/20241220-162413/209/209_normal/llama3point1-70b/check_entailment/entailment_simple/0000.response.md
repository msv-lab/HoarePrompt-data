Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`sublists`) as input and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `sublists`.
- For each sublist, it selects the first element (`sublist[0]`) and adds it to the output list.
- The function then returns this list of first elements, which matches the requirement specified in the problem description.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of non-empty lists), the program will not encounter any errors such as index out of range errors. Therefore, for every potential valid case, the program will correctly return a list containing the first element of each sublist, as specified in the problem description.
