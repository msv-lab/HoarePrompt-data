Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not fully meet the problem description. The function `func_1` raises an `IndexError` when encountering an empty sublist, which is a valid case according to the output hints. This is because the list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` attempts to access the first element of each sublist without checking if the sublist is empty. However, the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle empty sublists. 

A correct implementation should handle the case when a sublist is empty. For instance, it could skip empty sublists, return a specific value to indicate the absence of an element, or raise a custom exception with a meaningful message.

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle empty sublists:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] if sublist else None for sublist in sublists]
```

This modified version returns `None` for empty sublists, which can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the problem. Without explicit handling for empty sublists in the original code, and considering theactual problem statement, the correctness of the program is **False**.
