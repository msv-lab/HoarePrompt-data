Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

The problem description requires a function to get the first element of each sublist. The provided code attempts to achieve this using a list comprehension. However, as pointed out in the original assessment, the code does not handle the case where a sublist is empty, which would raise an `IndexError`.

The output hints confirm that the function does not handle empty sublists and will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of an empty sublist. However, the output hints also assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. This assumption is crucial in determining the correctness of the program.

Given that the problem description does not explicitly require the function to handle empty sublists or invalid inputs, and the output hints assume valid inputs, I believe the original assessment is too strict.

The program does meet the problem description for valid inputs, and the output hints support this. The function correctly returns the first element of each non-empty sublist, and it does not modify the original input list or its sublists.

Therefore, I will change the original assessment to reflect that the program is correct under the assumption of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
