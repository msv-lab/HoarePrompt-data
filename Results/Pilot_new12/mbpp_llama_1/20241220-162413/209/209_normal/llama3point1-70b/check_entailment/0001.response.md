Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If a sublist is empty, trying to access its first element (`sublist[0]`) will raise an `IndexError`. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]`, the program will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of the second sublist, which is empty.

To fix this issue, the program could be modified to check if a sublist is empty before trying to access its first element. For instance:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```

This modified version will skip empty sublists and only return the first elements of non-empty sublists. Alternatively, the program could be modified to handle empty sublists in a different way, such as by returning a default value or by raising a custom error.
