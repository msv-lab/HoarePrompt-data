You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If a sublist is empty, attempting to access its first element (`sublist[0]`) will result in an `IndexError`. 

For example, if the input is `[[], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, the program will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of the first sublist. 

To handle this case, the program could add a check to ensure that each sublist is not empty before attempting to access its first element. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists (sublists) as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist. If a sublist is empty, it will raise an IndexError when trying to access the first element. The function does not modify the original input list or its sublists. It handles sublists of varying lengths and returns a list of the same length as the input list, with each element being the first element of the corresponding sublist. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function assumes that all elements in the input list are lists themselves and does not include any error checking for non-list elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
