#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that has this maximum length
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of any sublist and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If the input list is empty, the function will throw an error when trying to find the maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function will return the first one it encounters. The function does not modify the original list of lists. In the case where the input list is not empty but all sublists are empty, the function will return a tuple with a length of 0 and the first empty sublist. The function assumes that the input is a list of lists, and it does not perform any error checking on the input type.
