The code creates a new list called `max_sublists` that includes only the sublists from `list_of_lists` where the length of the sublist is equal to `max_len`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length of `max_len`.**
