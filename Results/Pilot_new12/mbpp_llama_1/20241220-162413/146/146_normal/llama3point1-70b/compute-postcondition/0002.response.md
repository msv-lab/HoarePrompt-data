The program returns `max_len` which is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists[0]` which is the first sublist from `max_sublists`. `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length of `max_len`.
Output State: **The program returns the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that has this maximum length**
