Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for the function to return the "list of maximum length" in a list of lists. However, the function only returns the first sublist with the maximum length, along with the maximum length itself.

A correct implementation should return all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement because it uses `max_sublists[0]` to return only the first sublist with the maximum length.

To fix this, the function should be modified to return the entire `max_sublists` list, which contains all sublists with the maximum length. Here's the corrected code:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists  # Return all sublists with the maximum length
```
