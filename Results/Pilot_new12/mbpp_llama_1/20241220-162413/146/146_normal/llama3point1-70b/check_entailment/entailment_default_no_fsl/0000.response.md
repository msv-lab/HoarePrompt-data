Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the code only returns the first sublist that has the maximum length. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the code will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])` because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` have the maximum length. 

The code is missing the logic to handle the case when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. It only returns the first one it encounters, instead of returning all of them. 

To fix this, the code should be modified to return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected code would be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
