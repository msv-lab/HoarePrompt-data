Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with this program is that it returns only the first sublist of maximum length, instead of the list of all sublists of maximum length. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the function should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])`. However, this function will only return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`.

To fix this, the function should return `(max_len, max_sublists)` instead of `(max_len, max_sublists[0])`, where `max_sublists` is the list of all sublists with the maximum length.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
