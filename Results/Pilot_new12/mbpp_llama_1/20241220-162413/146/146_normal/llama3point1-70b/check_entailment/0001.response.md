Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, implying that all sublists with the maximum length should be returned. However, the given program returns only the first sublist with the maximum length.

For example, if we have the following input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, while the expected output should be `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])`. This is because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` have the maximum length of 3.

To fix this issue, the program should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected program would be:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```

This corrected version will return all sublists with the maximum length, as expected by the problem description.
