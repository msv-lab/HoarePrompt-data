Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, the program only returns the first sublist that has the maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function will only return the first one, not all of them.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the function will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return all sublists with maximum length, i.e., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`.

To fix this, the function should return all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected function would be:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```

However, since the problem description asks for the "list of maximum length", it's unclear whether it wants all sublists with maximum length or just one of them. If it's the former, the corrected function above would be correct. If it's the latter, the original function would be correct, but it would be more accurate to return all sublists with maximum length. 

In any case, since the program does not meet the problem description as it is currently written, the correctness is **False**.
