Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function is supposed to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but it returns a tuple containing the maximum length and only the first sublist with this maximum length. This means that if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function will not return all of them, but only the first one it encounters. 

For example, if we have the following list of lists: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 3]]`, the function will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])` instead of `([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 3])` or a similar data structure that contains all sublists with the maximum length. This is a clear deviation from the problem description. 

Additionally, another issue with this code is when the input list is empty. As mentioned in the output hints, if the input list is empty, the function will throw an error when trying to find the maximum length. So, this also shows that the function does not handle all possible cases as specified in the problem description. 

However, one might assume that the input is always valid and only contains lists of lists, which means the empty list case might not be considered. But still, the function does not return all lists of maximum length but only the first one. Therefore, the function does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
