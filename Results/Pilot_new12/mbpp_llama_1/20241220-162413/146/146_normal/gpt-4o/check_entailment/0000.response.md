Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. Initialization: The variables `max_len` and `max_list` are initialized to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding list, respectively. `max_len` is set to 0, which is the minimum possible length for a list, and `max_list` is set to an empty list.

2. Iteration: The function iterates over each list in the input `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than the current `max_len`.

3. Update: If the length of the current list is greater than `max_len`, the function updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and sets `max_list` to the current list.

4. Return: After iterating over all lists, the function returns a tuple containing the maximum length (`max_len`) and the corresponding list (`max_list`).

This solution correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty input list: In this case, the function will return `(0, [])`, which is the expected result.
* Input list with a single element: The function will correctly identify the single list as the longest list.
* Input list with multiple lists of the same maximum length: The function will return the first longest list it encounters, which is a valid result according to the problem description.
* Input list with lists of different lengths: The function will correctly identify the longest list.

Overall, the code is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
