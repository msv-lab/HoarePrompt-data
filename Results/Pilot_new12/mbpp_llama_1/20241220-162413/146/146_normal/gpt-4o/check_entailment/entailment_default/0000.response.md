Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the function as described. It iterates through each list in the input list of lists, keeps track of the maximum length found so far and the corresponding list, and returns both the maximum length and the longest list as a tuple. 

The output hints agree with the code, describing the function's behavior of returning the length and the content of the longest list within the input collection, handling the case of an empty input list by defaulting to a length of 0 and an empty list, and not modifying the original input. 

In case of a tie, where multiple lists have the same maximum length, the function returns the first longest list it encounters. This behavior is consistent with the description provided and is a valid way to handle such a scenario.

The examples given also support the correctness of the function, demonstrating its ability to identify the longest list and return both its length and content. Since the input is assumed to be valid, we do not need to consider edge cases such as the input not being a list of lists or being empty, as these are assumed to be handled by the context in which this function is being used.

Therefore, the code matches the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input.
