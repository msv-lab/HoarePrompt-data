Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a correct implementation of the problem description. It finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists and returns both the length and the list itself as a tuple. The function handles the edge case where the input list is empty by defaulting to a length of 0 and an empty list.

The function iterates over each list in the input list of lists, keeping track of the maximum length and the corresponding list. If it encounters a list with a length greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum length and the corresponding list. If multiple lists have the same maximum length, it returns the first one it encounters.

The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, including its handling of edge cases and its behavior in the presence of ties. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness.

In this case, I couldn't find any examples where the program does not work as expected in the description. The code seems to handle all potential cases correctly, including the edge case of an empty input list. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
