Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists and return both the length of the longest list and the list itself.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Handling empty input list**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention handling an empty input list, the provided unit tests and the function's documentation indicate that it should return a tuple containing 0 and an empty list in such a case. The function behaves as expected in this scenario.

2. **Identifying the longest list**: The function iterates over each list in the input list of lists and keeps track of the longest list found so far by comparing the lengths of the lists. When it encounters a list that is longer than the current longest list, it updates the `max_len` and `max_list` variables. This approach ensures that the function will always find the longest list, or one of them if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length.

3. **Returning the correct values**: The function returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list (`max_len`) and the longest list itself (`max_list`). This matches the problem description's requirement to return the list of maximum length, which implies returning both the length and the list.

4. **Handling ties**: The function's documentation mentions that it will return the first longest list it encounters in case of a tie. This means that if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, the function will return the first one it finds. The problem description does not specify how to handle ties, so this behavior is a reasonable choice.

5. **No modification of the original input**: The function does not modify the original input list, which is in line with the problem description's implicit expectation that the function should provide an analysis of the input list's contents without altering it.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, handling various scenarios, including empty input lists and ties, in a reasonable and consistent manner.
