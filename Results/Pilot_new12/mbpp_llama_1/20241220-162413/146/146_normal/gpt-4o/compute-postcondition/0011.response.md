According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 lists and the `lst` is the third list in the `list_of_lists`. 
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is either 0, the length of the first list, or the length of the second list, `max_list` is either an empty list, the first list, or the second list**
