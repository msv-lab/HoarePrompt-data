Postcondition: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is updated to `lst`. Otherwise, the values of `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged, with `max_len` being either 0, the length of the first list, or the length of the second list, and `max_list` being either an empty list, the first list, or the second list.**
