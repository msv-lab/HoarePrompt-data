According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 2 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least one list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 lists and `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is either 0 or the length of the first list, `max_list` is either an empty list or the first list**
