To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists.
- `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_len` is either 0 or the length of the first list.
- `max_list` is either an empty list or the first list.

The code provided is:
```python
max_len = len(lst)
```

This line of code updates the value of `max_len` to be the length of `lst`, which is the second list in `list_of_lists`.

The output state will be:
- `list_of_lists` is still a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists.
- `lst` is still the second list in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_len` is now the length of `lst` (the second list in `list_of_lists`), not necessarily related to the first list anymore.
- `max_list` remains either an empty list or the first list, as its value is not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is either an empty list or the first list**
