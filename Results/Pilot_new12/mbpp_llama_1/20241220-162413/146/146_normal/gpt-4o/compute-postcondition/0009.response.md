The value of `max_list` is updated to be equal to `lst`, which is the second list in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, which is equal to `lst`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`.**
