The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the length of `lst`, which is the first list in `list_of_lists`. The previous value of `max_len` was 0, but it is now updated to the length of `lst`. The value of `lst` is not changed, and it is still the first list in `list_of_lists`. The length of `lst` is greater than the initial value of `max_len`, which was 0.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least one list, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`**
