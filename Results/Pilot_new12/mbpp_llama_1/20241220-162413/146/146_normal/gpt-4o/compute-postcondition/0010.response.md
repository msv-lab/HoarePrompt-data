Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `lst` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is updated to `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` and `max_list` retain their original values, with `max_len` being either 0 or the length of the first list, and `max_list` being either an empty list or the first list.***
