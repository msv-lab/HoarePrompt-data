To calculate the result, we first need to understand the initial state and the impact of the code on the program. 

The initial state is: 
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists.
- `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_len` is either 0, the length of the first list, or the length of the second list.
- `max_list` is either an empty list, the first list, or the second list.

Now, let's analyze the code:
```python
max_len = len(lst)
```
This line of code updates the value of `max_len` to be the length of `lst`, which is the third list in `list_of_lists`. 

Therefore, the value of `max_len` is now the length of the third list in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is either an empty list, the first list, or the second list**
