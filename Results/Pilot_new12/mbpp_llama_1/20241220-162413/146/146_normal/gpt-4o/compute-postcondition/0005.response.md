`max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the first list in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least one list, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, and `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least one list, `max_len` is equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is equal to the first list in `list_of_lists`, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`**
