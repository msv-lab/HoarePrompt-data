The code snippet provided assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. 
`lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is the length of `lst`. 
The length of `lst` and `list_of_lists` having at least 3 lists remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is `lst`**
