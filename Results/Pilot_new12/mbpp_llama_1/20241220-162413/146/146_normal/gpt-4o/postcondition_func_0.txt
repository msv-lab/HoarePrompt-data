The function accepts a list of lists as input, determines the length of the longest list within this collection, identifies the longest list itself, and returns both values as a tuple. If the input list is empty, it defaults to returning 0 as the length and an empty list as the longest list, thus handling the edge case of an empty input list. The function does not modify the original input list but provides an analysis of its contents. It will return the first longest list it encounters in case of a tie, where multiple lists have the same maximum length. The function's output provides a concise summary of the input list's structure, specifically focusing on the dimension and content of its longest sublist.
