#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` or 0 if `list_of_lists` is empty, and `max_list` is the longest list in `list_of_lists` or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns a tuple containing max_len, which is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` or 0 if `list_of_lists` is empty, and max_list, which is the longest list in `list_of_lists` or an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input, determines the length of the longest list within this collection, identifies the longest list itself, and returns both values as a tuple. If the input list is empty, it defaults to returning 0 as the length and an empty list as the longest list, thus handling the edge case of an empty input list. The function does not modify the original input list but provides an analysis of its contents. It will return the first longest list it encounters in case of a tie, where multiple lists have the same maximum length. The function's output provides a concise summary of the input list's structure, specifically focusing on the dimension and content of its longest sublist.
