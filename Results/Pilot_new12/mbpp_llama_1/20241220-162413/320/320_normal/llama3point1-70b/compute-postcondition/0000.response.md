The code converts the list of integers `nums` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements, and then converts it back into a list, assigning it to `unique_nums`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`.**
