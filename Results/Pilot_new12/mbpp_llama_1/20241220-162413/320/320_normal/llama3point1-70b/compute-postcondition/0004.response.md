To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and code step by step:

1. `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
2. `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`.
3. The length of `unique_nums` is 2 or more, indicating there are at least two unique integers in `nums`.
4. The code `return sorted(unique_nums)[1]` sorts the unique integers in ascending order and returns the second element (at index 1, since indexing starts at 0).

Given that `unique_nums` has a length of 2 or more and the code returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`, we can conclude:

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.**
