Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we analyze the effect of the code on the program. The code simply returns `None`, which means it does not depend on the values of `nums` or `unique_nums`. 

The initial state informs us that `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, and `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, currently having less than 2 elements. However, the return statement does not utilize these variables.

Therefore, regardless of the composition of `nums` and `unique_nums`, the program returns `None`.

Output State: **The program returns None**
