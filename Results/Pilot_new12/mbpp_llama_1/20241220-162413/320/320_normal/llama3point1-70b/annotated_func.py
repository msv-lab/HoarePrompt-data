#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is 2 or more.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, checks if there are at least two distinct integers, and returns either `None` if there are less than two unique integers or the second smallest unique integer from the list. If the list contains two or more unique integers, it returns the second smallest one, effectively performing a sorting operation and extraction of the second element. The function handles edge cases where the list may contain two distinct integers or more, but does not have any specific handling for empty lists or lists with non-integer values, which may lead to unexpected behavior. The final state of the program after it concludes is either having `None` returned, indicating the list did not meet the condition of having at least two distinct integers, or having the second smallest unique integer returned, indicating the successful extraction of the desired value from the list.
