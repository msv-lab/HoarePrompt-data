You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is 2 or more.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, checks if there are at least two distinct integers, and returns either `None` if there are less than two unique integers or the second smallest unique integer from the list. If the list contains two or more unique integers, it returns the second smallest one, effectively performing a sorting operation and extraction of the second element. The function handles edge cases where the list may contain two distinct integers or more, but does not have any specific handling for empty lists or lists with non-integer values, which may lead to unexpected behavior. The final state of the program after it concludes is either having `None` returned, indicating the list did not meet the condition of having at least two distinct integers, or having the second smallest unique integer returned, indicating the successful extraction of the desired value from the list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
