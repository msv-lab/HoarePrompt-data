Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using a set, then sorting the unique numbers and returning the second element.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program correctly handles the case when there is only one unique number in the list by returning `None`. This is because there cannot be a second smallest number if there is only one unique number.
2. The program correctly handles the case when the list is empty or has less than two unique elements by returning `None`.
3. The program correctly handles the case when there are duplicate numbers in the list by removing duplicates using a set.
4. The program correctly handles the case when the list has two or more unique elements by sorting the unique numbers and returning the second element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles all edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, a list with duplicate elements, and a list with two or more unique elements. Therefore, the program is correct. 

You can test the function with some examples like this:
```python
# Test with a list of unique numbers
print(func_1([5, 2, 9]))  # Expected output: 5

# Test with a list of duplicate numbers
print(func_1([1, 1, 2]))  # Expected output: 2

# Test with a list of a single unique number
print(func_1([5, 5, 5]))  # Expected output: None

# Test with an empty list
print(func_1([]))  # Expected output: None

# Test with a list of two unique numbers
print(func_1([1, 2]))  # Expected output: 2
```
