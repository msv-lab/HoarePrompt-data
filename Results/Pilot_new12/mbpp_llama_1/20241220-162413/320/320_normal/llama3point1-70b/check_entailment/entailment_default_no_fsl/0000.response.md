Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest number in the list. Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Handling duplicates**: The code correctly handles duplicates by converting the input list to a set, which removes any duplicate integers. It then converts the set back to a list.

2. **Checking for at least two distinct integers**: The code checks if the length of the unique numbers list is less than 2 and returns `None` in that case. This correctly handles edge cases where the list may contain less than two distinct integers.

3. **Sorting and extraction**: The code sorts the unique numbers list and returns the second element (at index 1), which is the second smallest unique integer.

4. **Input assumptions**: As per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be a valid list of integers, which may or may not contain duplicates, and may or may not be empty. However, given the assumption that the input will always be valid, the code does not need to explicitly handle invalid input cases.

Since the code correctly handles the specified requirements and edge cases for valid inputs, and given the assumption that the input will always be valid, the code can be considered correct.
