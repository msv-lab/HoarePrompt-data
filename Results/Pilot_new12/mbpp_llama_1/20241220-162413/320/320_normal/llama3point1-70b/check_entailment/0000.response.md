Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is a function named `func_1` that finds the second smallest number in a list of numbers. Here's why it works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Handling Non-Unique Numbers**: The function first converts the input list `nums` to a set `unique_nums`, which automatically removes any duplicate numbers. This is a correct approach because the problem asks for the second smallest number, not the second smallest distinct occurrence.

2. **Edge Case for Less Than 2 Unique Numbers**: The function checks if there are less than 2 unique numbers (`if len(unique_nums) < 2`). If so, it returns `None`, which is a reasonable response since there cannot be a second smallest number without at least two distinct numbers.

3. **Finding the Second Smallest Number**: The function then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order (`sorted(unique_nums)`) and returns the second element (`[1]`), which corresponds to the second smallest number.

Considering all these steps, the function seems to handle all potential cases correctly:
- It removes duplicates to ensure the concept of "second smallest" refers to distinct numbers.
- It checks for the edge case where there are not enough distinct numbers.
- It follows a straightforward and correct logic to find and return the second smallest number.

Therefore, without being able to think of a case where the program does not work as expected based on the provided problem description, the conclusion must be that the program is correct.
