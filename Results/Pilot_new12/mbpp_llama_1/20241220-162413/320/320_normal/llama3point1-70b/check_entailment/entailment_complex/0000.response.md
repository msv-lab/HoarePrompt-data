Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the problem description. The function is supposed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why the program does what the problem description says:

1. The function first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. This ensures that all numbers in the list are unique.
2. It then checks if there are at least two distinct integers in the list. If there are less than two unique integers, it returns `None`.
3. If there are at least two unique integers, it sorts the list of unique integers and returns the second smallest one, which is the integer at index 1 in the sorted list.

This program meets the problem description because it correctly finds the second smallest number in the list, or returns `None` if there are less than two distinct integers. The program assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., it will be a list with at least two integers, which is in line with the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem description, and there are no edge cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
