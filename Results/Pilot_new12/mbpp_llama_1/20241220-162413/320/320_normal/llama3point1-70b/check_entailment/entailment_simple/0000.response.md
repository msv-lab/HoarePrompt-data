Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

- It first removes duplicate elements from the input list `nums` by converting it to a set and then back to a list, stored in `unique_nums`. This is a necessary step because it directly addresses the problem's requirement of finding the second smallest number, which implies uniqueness.
- It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If so, it returns `None`. This check aligns with the problem's implicit assumption that there should be at least two distinct elements in the list to find the second smallest number. Although the problem description doesn't explicitly state what to do in such a case, the provided program's behavior (returning `None`) can be considered as an acceptable handling of this edge case, given that the main goal (finding the second smallest number) cannot be achieved without at least two distinct numbers.
- If there are at least two distinct numbers, it sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`), which is the second smallest number in the original list. This directly fulfills the problem's requirement.

Given that we assume the input will always be valid (a list of integers with at least two distinct elements), the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for every potential valid case.
