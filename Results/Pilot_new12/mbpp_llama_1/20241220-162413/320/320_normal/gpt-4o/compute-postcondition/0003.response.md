Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest unique integer in the list. If the list has less than two unique integers, the function returns None. The function does not modify the original input list. The return value can be any integer, including negative numbers and zero, as long as it is the second smallest unique integer in the list. If the list is empty or has only one unique integer, the function will return None, which is the expected behavior. The function considers duplicate integers in the input list as a single unique integer.**
