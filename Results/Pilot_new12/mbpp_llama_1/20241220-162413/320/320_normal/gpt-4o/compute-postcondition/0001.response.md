The program checks if the length of `unique_nums` is greater than 1. Since `nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements and `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`, `unique_nums` will also have at least two elements. Therefore, the condition `len(unique_nums) > 1` will always be true.

Given that `unique_nums` is sorted, `unique_nums[1]` will be the second smallest unique integer in `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest unique integer in the list `nums`.**
