Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why it works correctly:

1. It first converts the input list `nums` into a set `unique_nums`, which removes any duplicate numbers. This is necessary because the problem asks for the second smallest unique number, not the second smallest number in the list (which could be the same as the smallest if there are duplicates).
2. It then sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest number is at index 0 and the second smallest number (if it exists) is at index 1.
3. The function returns `unique_nums[1]` if the length of `unique_nums` is greater than 1, which means there is at least one number other than the smallest. If the length is 1 or less, it means all numbers in the list are the same, so it returns `None`.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function:

- In the first test, the second smallest number is indeed -2.
- In the second test, the second smallest number is -0.5.
- In the third and fourth tests, the function correctly returns `None` because all numbers in the lists are the same.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
