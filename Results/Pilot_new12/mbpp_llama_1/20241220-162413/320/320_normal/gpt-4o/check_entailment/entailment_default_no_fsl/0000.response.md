Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
2. It converts the list to a set `unique_nums` to remove duplicates and then sorts the set in ascending order.
3. If the length of `unique_nums` is greater than 1, it returns the second element (index 1), which is the second smallest unique integer in the list.
4. If the length of `unique_nums` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest unique integer in the list.

The provided unit tests and output hints support this explanation. The function handles cases where the list has less than two unique integers, including empty lists and lists with duplicate integers. The function also correctly returns the second smallest unique integer for lists with two or more unique integers.

For example, the test case `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2` shows that the function correctly returns the second smallest unique integer even when there are duplicate integers in the list. The test case `func_1([2, 2]) == None` demonstrates that the function returns `None` when the list has less than two unique integers.

Overall, the code correctly implements the function to find the second smallest unique integer in a list, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
