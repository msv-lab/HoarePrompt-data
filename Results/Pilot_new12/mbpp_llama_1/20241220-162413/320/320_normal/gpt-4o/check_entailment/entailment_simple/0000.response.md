Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The reason for this is as follows:

1. The problem description asks to write a function to find the second smallest number in a list. The provided program does this by first converting the input list `nums` to a set of unique numbers and then sorting this set in ascending order. 
2. If the list contains less than two unique numbers (i.e., `len(unique_nums) <= 1`), the function returns `None`, which can be considered as not having a second smallest number.
3. In the case where the list contains at least two unique numbers (`len(unique_nums) > 1`), the function returns the second smallest number, which is the number at index 1 in the sorted list of unique numbers (`unique_nums[1]`).
4. The provided unit tests also support this, demonstrating the function's correctness for various cases, including when there are duplicate numbers, negative numbers, and when the list contains less than two unique numbers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It handles all potential cases, including lists with duplicate numbers and lists with less than two unique numbers, and returns the expected results. Therefore, its correctness is verified.
