The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 

The function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using a set, sorting the unique numbers, and then returning the second smallest number if it exists.

The provided unit tests support the correctness of the function, and the original assessment accurately explains the reasoning behind the function's correctness.

The annotated version of the code also confirms the original assessment. The annotation before the function call states that `nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, but this does not necessarily have to be the case as the function can handle lists with duplicate elements and lists with less than two distinct elements, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

Based on the annotated version and the original assessment, I believe that the program is correct. The function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements and returns `None` when there is no second smallest number, which aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
