Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, finds the unique integers in the list, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the second smallest unique integer. If the list has less than two unique integers, the function returns `None`.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function first converts the input list to a set, which removes any duplicate integers. This ensures that the function only considers unique integers.

2. The set of unique integers is then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted` function. This puts the smallest unique integer at index 0 and the second smallest unique integer at index 1 of the sorted list.

3. The function returns the second smallest unique integer, which is at index 1 of the sorted list, if the list has more than one unique integer. If the list has less than two unique integers, the function returns `None`, as expected.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists with more than two unique integers
* Lists with exactly two unique integers
* Lists with less than two unique integers (i.e., lists with one unique integer or lists with duplicate integers)

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different input scenarios. Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and is therefore correct.
