Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list. It uses the `set` function to remove duplicates from the list, and then sorts the unique numbers. The code then checks if the length of the set is greater than 1. If it is, it returns the second smallest number; otherwise, it returns `None`.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples that demonstrate its correctness. The function handles cases where the list has less than two unique integers, returning `None` as expected. It also correctly handles lists with duplicate integers, considering them as a single unique integer.

The provided unit tests in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For example, in the test case `assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2`, the function correctly returns `-2` as the second smallest unique integer. Similarly, in the test case `assert func_1([2, 2]) == None`, the function correctly returns `None` since the list has only one unique integer.

Overall, the code correctly implements the function to find the second smallest number in a list, and the output hints and unit tests support its correctness.
