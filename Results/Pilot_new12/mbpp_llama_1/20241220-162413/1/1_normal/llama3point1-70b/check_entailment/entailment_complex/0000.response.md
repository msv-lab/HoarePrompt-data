Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1` does exactly this by performing a set intersection operation, which returns the elements common to both input lists. 

The function takes two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input, converts them into sets, performs the intersection operation using the `&` operator, and then converts the resulting set back into a tuple. This tuple contains the unique elements common to both input lists. 

Since sets in Python cannot contain duplicate elements, the function inherently removes any duplicates from the resulting common elements, ensuring that the returned tuple contains only unique elements. If there are no common elements between the two input lists, the function will return an empty tuple, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

The function's behavior aligns with the problem description in all cases, assuming that the input will always be valid (i.e., two non-empty lists containing hashable elements). Therefore, based on the provided annotations and problem description, the program is correct and will always return the shared elements from the two input lists.
