Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it effectively finds the shared elements from the given two lists (in this case, tuples). The `set` function is used to convert the tuples into sets, which allows for the use of the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, i.e., the shared elements. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Type Conversion to Set**: The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and converts them into sets using the `set()` function. This step is crucial because sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, and they support mathematical operations such as intersection (`&`), union (`|`), and difference (`-`).

2. **Finding Intersection**: The `&` operator between two sets returns a new set with elements common to both. This directly addresses the problem's requirement of finding shared elements between two lists.

3. **Conversion Back to Tuple**: The result of the intersection operation (a set of shared elements) is then converted back into a tuple before being returned. This ensures consistency in the output data type, as the input was tuples.

This program correctly handles various cases, including:

- **Empty Input Tuples**: If either or both of the input tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is the expected result since there are no shared elements.
- **Duplicate Elements**: If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, the function treats them as single unique elements because sets only store unique values. Thus, the output will contain each shared element only once.
- **Unordered Elements**: Since sets are unordered, the order of elements in the input tuples does not affect the result, making the function robust against variations in input ordering.

Overall, the provided function is a straightforward and effective solution for finding shared elements between two lists (tuples in this case), and it handles various potential cases correctly.
