Correctness: **True**

The code correctly finds the shared elements from the given two lists. It uses the set intersection operation to remove any duplicate elements from the resulting common elements. The function returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both input lists. If there are no common elements between the two input lists, the function returns an empty tuple.

The function is designed to work with lists, which are a type of collection that can be converted to sets. The set intersection operation is a standard way to find the common elements between two sets. The code does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input parameters are not lists, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this is not a concern.

The code also correctly preserves the contract that it does not modify the original input lists. The output of the function is a new tuple containing the common elements, and the original lists remain unchanged.

We also assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, so cases where the input lists may contain unhashable elements or may not be lists are not a concern.

Given these assumptions, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them in a tuple, while preserving the original input lists.
