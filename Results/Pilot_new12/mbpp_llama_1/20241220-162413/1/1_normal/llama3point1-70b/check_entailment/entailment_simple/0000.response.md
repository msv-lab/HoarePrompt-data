Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both lists.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists.
2. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, which aligns with the problem description.
3. The function uses the `set` data structure to find the intersection of the two lists, which gives the unique elements common to both lists. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of two sets.
4. The result is returned as a tuple, which is an acceptable data structure for returning the shared elements.

The program will work correctly for all potential cases, assuming the input is valid (i.e., two non-empty lists). For example:

- If the input lists are `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 4]`, the function will return `(2, 3)`, which are the shared elements.
- If the input lists are `[1, 1, 2]` and `[1, 2, 2]`, the function will return `(1, 2)`, which are the unique shared elements.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and will produce the correct results for all valid input cases.
