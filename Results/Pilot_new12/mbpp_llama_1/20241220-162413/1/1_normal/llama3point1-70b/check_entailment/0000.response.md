Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input and returns the shared elements from both tuples. It does this by converting the tuples to sets and then using the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which returns a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets. This new set is then converted back to a tuple and returned.

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty tuples: If either or both of the input tuples are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple.
- Duplicate elements: If there are duplicate elements in either tuple, the function will still return the correct shared elements because sets automatically eliminate duplicate elements.
- Different order of elements: The function is not affected by the order of elements in the tuples because sets are unordered.
- Non-integer elements: The function can handle tuples containing elements of any hashable type, such as strings or other tuples.

Therefore, the function is correct for all possible inputs, and its output matches the problem description.
