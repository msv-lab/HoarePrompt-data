Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both input tuples. The function uses set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common elements, which correctly identifies the shared elements between the two input tuples.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple containing the unique common elements, removes duplicates, and preserves the immutability of the tuple. The hints also mention that the function does not handle potential errors if the input parameters are not lists or contain unhashable elements, but since we assume valid input, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

The code correctly handles cases where there are no common elements between the two input tuples, returning an empty tuple. It also handles cases where the input tuples contain duplicate elements, as the set intersection operation removes duplicates.

In every potential case, the code correctly identifies the shared elements between the two input tuples, and therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
