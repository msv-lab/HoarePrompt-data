You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it effectively finds the shared elements from the given two lists (in this case, tuples). The `set` function is used to convert the tuples into sets, which allows for the use of the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, i.e., the shared elements. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Type Conversion to Set**: The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and converts them into sets using the `set()` function. This step is crucial because sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements, and they support mathematical operations such as intersection (`&`), union (`|`), and difference (`-`).

2. **Finding Intersection**: The `&` operator between two sets returns a new set with elements common to both. This directly addresses the problem's requirement of finding shared elements between two lists.

3. **Conversion Back to Tuple**: The result of the intersection operation (a set of shared elements) is then converted back into a tuple before being returned. This ensures consistency in the output data type, as the input was tuples.

This program correctly handles various cases, including:

- **Empty Input Tuples**: If either or both of the input tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple, which is the expected result since there are no shared elements.
- **Duplicate Elements**: If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, the function treats them as single unique elements because sets only store unique values. Thus, the output will contain each shared element only once.
- **Unordered Elements**: Since sets are unordered, the order of elements in the input tuples does not affect the result, making the function robust against variations in input ordering.

Overall, the provided function is a straightforward and effective solution for finding shared elements between two lists (tuples in this case), and it handles various potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both input lists. The function performs a set intersection operation, which removes any duplicate elements from the resulting common elements. If there are no common elements between the two input lists, the function returns an empty tuple. The original input lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, remain unchanged after the function executes. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input parameters are not lists, or if they contain unhashable elements. The function returns a tuple, which is an immutable collection, and does not preserve the original order of elements from the input lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
