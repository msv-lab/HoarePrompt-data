To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code converts the lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` into sets, finds their intersection (i.e., the elements common to both), and then converts this intersection back into a tuple before returning it.

Given that `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists, when they are converted into sets, any duplicate elements within each list are automatically removed because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values. The intersection operation `&` then identifies the unique elements that are present in both sets.

The resulting set of common elements is then converted back into a tuple. Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of elements, but when a set is converted to a tuple, the order of elements is not guaranteed to be the same as in the original lists or even in any specific order, due to the unordered nature of sets.

Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing the elements that are common to both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, with no duplicates and in an unspecified order.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both test_tup1 and test_tup2 lists.**
