#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both test_tup1 and test_tup2 lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the unique elements common to both input lists. The function performs a set intersection operation, which removes any duplicate elements from the resulting common elements. If there are no common elements between the two input lists, the function returns an empty tuple. The original input lists, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, remain unchanged after the function executes. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur if the input parameters are not lists, or if they contain unhashable elements. The function returns a tuple, which is an immutable collection, and does not preserve the original order of elements from the input lists.
