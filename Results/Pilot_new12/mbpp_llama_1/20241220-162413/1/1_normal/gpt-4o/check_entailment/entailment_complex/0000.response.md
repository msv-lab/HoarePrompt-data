Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that. It uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common elements between `list1` and `list2`, and then returns these elements as a tuple, sorted in ascending order.

The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description in all potential cases:

- When there are common elements, it returns them in a tuple, sorted in ascending order.
- When there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.
- It handles duplicate elements in the input lists by removing duplicates in the output tuple, due to the use of sets.
- It always returns a tuple, even if there is only one common element.

The use of sets for finding common elements ensures efficient lookup and removal of duplicates. The sorting of the common elements before returning them as a tuple ensures that the output is in a consistent order, making it easier to compare and utilize the results.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., `list1` and `list2` will be lists and will not contain non-hashable elements), the function is correctly implemented according to the problem description.
