Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It finds the shared elements from the given two lists, removes duplicates due to the use of sets, and returns them as a tuple sorted in ascending order. If there are no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.

The function's implementation is straightforward: it converts the input lists to sets, finds their intersection (`common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)`), sorts the result (`sorted(common_elements)`), and returns it as a tuple. This approach ensures that all shared elements are found, duplicates are removed, and the output is sorted, which aligns with the problem description.

Moreover, the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) validate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, further supporting the conclusion that the code is correct for its intended purpose.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the code handles the task as specified without any identifiable deviations or cases where it fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, based on the problem description, output hints, and the assumption of valid input, the code is deemed correct for all potential cases within its defined scope.
