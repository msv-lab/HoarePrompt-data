Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples, `list1` and `list2`, as input and returns a tuple of shared elements from the two input lists. The function uses the set intersection operator `&` to find the common elements between the two input lists, then sorts and returns them as a tuple.

This program correctly implements the problem description. The use of sets ensures efficient lookup and intersection of elements, and the sorting of the result ensures that the output is consistent and ordered.

The provided unit tests (assert statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. The function correctly handles cases where the input lists have multiple shared elements, as well as cases where the shared elements appear in different orders in the input lists.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles all possible input combinations and returns the shared elements as required. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is True.
