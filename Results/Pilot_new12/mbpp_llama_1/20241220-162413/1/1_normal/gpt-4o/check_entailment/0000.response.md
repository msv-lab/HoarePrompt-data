Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of the shared elements between the two lists. The function uses the set intersection operation `&` to find the common elements, which is an efficient approach. 

The use of `tuple(sorted(common_elements))` ensures that the returned tuple is sorted, which is a reasonable assumption given the unit tests provided. 

Upon careful analysis, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements (although duplicates are not preserved in the output), empty lists, and lists with no common elements (in which case it returns an empty tuple). 

It's worth noting that the problem description does not specify the order of the output elements, so the use of `sorted` is a reasonable choice. However, if the problem description required preserving the original order of the elements, the function would need to be modified. 

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
