You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples, `list1` and `list2`, as input and returns a tuple of shared elements from the two input lists. The function uses the set intersection operator `&` to find the common elements between the two input lists, then sorts and returns them as a tuple.

This program correctly implements the problem description. The use of sets ensures efficient lookup and intersection of elements, and the sorting of the result ensures that the output is consistent and ordered.

The provided unit tests (assert statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. The function correctly handles cases where the input lists have multiple shared elements, as well as cases where the shared elements appear in different orders in the input lists.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles all possible input combinations and returns the shared elements as required. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is True.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the common elements of `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. If there are no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple. The function handles duplicate elements in the input lists by removing duplicates in the output tuple, due to the use of sets for finding common elements. The original input lists, `list1` and `list2`, remain unchanged after the function call. The function does not handle non-list input types or non-hashable elements within the lists, as the code does not include any error checking for such cases. The function's return value is always a tuple, even if there is only one common element.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
