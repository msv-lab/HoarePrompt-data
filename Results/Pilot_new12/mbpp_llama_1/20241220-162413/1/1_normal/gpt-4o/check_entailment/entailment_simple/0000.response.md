To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it successfully finds the shared elements from the two given lists as stated in the problem description.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as input. It uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common elements between the two lists. The result is then converted to a tuple and sorted in ascending order before being returned.

Here's a breakdown of why this program is correct:

1. **Set Intersection**: The use of `set(list1) & set(list2)` effectively finds the elements that are common to both lists. This operation is the crucial step in achieving the goal stated in the problem description.

2. **Handling Duplicates**: By converting the lists to sets, the function automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list. This means that even if an element appears multiple times in both lists, it will only appear once in the result.

3. **Sorting and Returning as Tuple**: The `sorted` function is used to sort the common elements in ascending order, and the result is returned as a tuple. This ensures that the output is consistent and predictable, which is beneficial for further processing or display.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists and returns them in a sorted and ordered manner.

Correctness: **True**
