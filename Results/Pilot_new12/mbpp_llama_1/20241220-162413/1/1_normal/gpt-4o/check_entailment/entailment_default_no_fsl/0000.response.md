Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description's requirements. It accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple containing the common elements of `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. The use of sets (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) ensures that duplicate elements in the input lists are removed in the output tuple, and the function handles cases where there are no common elements by returning an empty tuple.

The function does not explicitly handle non-list input types or non-hashable elements within the lists, but as per the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, under the assumption of valid input, the function works correctly for every potential case.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including lists with common elements, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with no common elements. Based on these tests and the function's implementation, it can be concluded that the code does what the problem description says for every potential case, assuming valid input.
