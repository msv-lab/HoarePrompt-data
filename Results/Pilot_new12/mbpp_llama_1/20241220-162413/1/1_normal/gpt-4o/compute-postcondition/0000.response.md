The code calculates the common elements between `list1` and `list2` using the set intersection operation `&`. This operation returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `common_elements` is a set equal to the intersection of `list1` and `list2`.**
