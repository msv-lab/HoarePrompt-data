To determine the output state, let's consider the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `list1` is a list.
- `list2` is a list.
- `common_elements` is a set equal to the intersection of `list1` and `list2`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
```

This code first sorts the elements in `common_elements` in ascending order and then converts the sorted list into a tuple. The `common_elements` set contains elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

Given that `common_elements` is the intersection of `list1` and `list2`, the returned tuple will contain unique elements that are common to both lists, sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the common elements of `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order.**
