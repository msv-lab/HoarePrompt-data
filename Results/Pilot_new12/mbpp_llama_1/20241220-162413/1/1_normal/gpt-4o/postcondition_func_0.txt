The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the common elements of `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. If there are no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple. The function handles duplicate elements in the input lists by removing duplicates in the output tuple, due to the use of sets for finding common elements. The original input lists, `list1` and `list2`, remain unchanged after the function call. The function does not handle non-list input types or non-hashable elements within the lists, as the code does not include any error checking for such cases. The function's return value is always a tuple, even if there is only one common element.
