The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The function correctly handles various cases, including when the element is present in the array, when the element is not present in the array, when the array is empty, and when there are duplicate elements in the array.

The output hints provided support the original assessment by describing the function's behavior and highlighting its correctness for different scenarios. The hints explain how the function searches for the element, returns the correct index when found, and handles edge cases such as an empty list, duplicate elements, and searching for special values like `None`. The hints also mention that the function is efficient for large lists because it stops as soon as it finds a match and does not modify the original list or the element being searched.

Based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the program's functionality aligns with the expected behavior. There is no evidence from the annotations, the original assessment, or the output hints that suggests the program does not meet the problem description.

Therefore, the reason for maintaining the original assessment is that the code and its behavior, as described by the output hints, align with the requirements specified in the problem description. There are no discrepancies or indications that the program fails to meet the problem description's expectations.

Final: **True**
