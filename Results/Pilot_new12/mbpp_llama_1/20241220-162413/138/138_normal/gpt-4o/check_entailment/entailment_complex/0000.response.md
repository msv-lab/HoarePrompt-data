Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function iterates over the list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in the list. If the element is found, the function immediately returns `True` along with the index of the matching element. If the element is not found after iterating over the entire list, the function returns `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element was not located in the list.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem description, including:

- If the element is found in the array, the function returns `True` and the index of the element.
- If the element is not found in the array, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm the correctness of the program by checking its behavior with different inputs.

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, making it correct according to the given assumptions about valid inputs and the problem requirements.
