Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code for the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which allows it to access both the index and value of each element. As soon as it finds a match, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If it iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional information about the function's behavior. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with duplicate elements, and searching for special values like `None`. The function does not modify the original list or the element being searched.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness. For example, `func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31)` returns `(True, 3)`, which is the expected result.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description and output hints.
