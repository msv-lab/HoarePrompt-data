The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly implements a function that takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The output hints also support the original assessment. They accurately describe the functionality of the code, including how it handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with duplicate elements, and searching for special values like `None`. The hints also point out the efficiency of the function due to its use of `enumerate` and its ability to stop as soon as it finds a match.

Given that the code matches the problem description and the output hints confirm its correctness, there's no reason to change the original assessment.

Final: **True**
