You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with elements in arr.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states for the first few iterations.
    #
    #1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in `arr`.
    #
    #2. **Conditional Return**: Inside the loop, there's a conditional check `if value == element`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `True` along with the index of the matching element.
    #
    #3. **Output States Analysis**:
    #   - After the loop executes 1 time, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `value` is not equal to `element`, or the loop would have returned.
    #   - After the loop executes 2 times, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. If `value` equals `element` at any point, the function returns; otherwise, it continues.
    #   - After the loop executes 3 times, similar logic applies, with the function returning if a match is found.
    #
    #**Determining the Final Output State**:
    #
    #- **If `element` is found in `arr`**: The loop will return `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. In this case, the loop does not complete all iterations.
    #  
    #- **If `element` is not found in `arr`**: The loop will iterate over all elements in `arr` without finding a match. In this scenario, the function does not explicitly return a value, implying it returns `None` by default in many programming languages. The state of `arr`, `element`, `index`, and `value` after the loop would reflect the last iteration: `index` would be the last index of `arr`, `value` would be the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` would retain their original values since the loop does not modify them.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished (or not, in the case of an early return) can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #- If `element` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`.
    #- If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function implicitly returns `None`, with `index` being the last index of `arr`, `value` being the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` remaining unchanged.
    #
    #However, the task requires focusing on the state of variables after the loop, considering the original task's format for the answer.
    #
    #**Output State: `arr` is a list, `element` is any type of object, if `element` is in `arr`, the function returns True and the index of `element`; otherwise, the function returns None, with `index` being the last index of `arr` and `value` being the last element of `arr`.**
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False, indicating that the element was not found, and -1, representing an invalid index, signifying that the element was not located in the list.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
