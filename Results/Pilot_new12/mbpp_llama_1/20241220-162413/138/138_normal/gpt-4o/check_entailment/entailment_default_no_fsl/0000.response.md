Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function handles various potential cases, including:

- Searching for an element in a non-empty list.
- Searching for an element that is present in the list, where it correctly returns `True` and the index of the element.
- Searching for an element that is not present in the list, where it correctly returns `False` and `-1`.
- Handling an empty list, where it correctly returns `False` and `-1` without throwing an error.
- Handling duplicate elements in the list, where it correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.

The provided output hints agree with the functionality of the code and highlight the edge cases that the function handles correctly. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid, we don't need to worry about cases where the input is not a list or the element is not a valid type to search for in the list. Therefore, based on the problem description and the code provided, the function `func_1` works as expected and handles all potential cases correctly.
