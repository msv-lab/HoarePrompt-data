Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The program uses the enumerate function to iterate over the array, which provides both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the target element, it immediately returns a tuple with True and the index. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns a tuple with False and -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for several different cases. Additionally, the function's logic is sound and will work correctly for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as an empty array or an array with duplicate elements. 

For example, if we consider the case where the input array is empty, `func_1([], 31)` will correctly return `(False, -1)`, because it will not find the target element in the array.

Overall, the function is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the required functionality, making it correct for all potential cases.
