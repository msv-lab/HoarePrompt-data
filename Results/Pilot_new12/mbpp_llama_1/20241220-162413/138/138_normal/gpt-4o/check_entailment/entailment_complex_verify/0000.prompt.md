You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The program uses the enumerate function to iterate over the array, which provides both the index and the value of each element. If the value matches the target element, it immediately returns a tuple with True and the index. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns a tuple with False and -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for several different cases. Additionally, the function's logic is sound and will work correctly for all possible inputs, including edge cases such as an empty array or an array with duplicate elements. 

For example, if we consider the case where the input array is empty, `func_1([], 31)` will correctly return `(False, -1)`, because it will not find the target element in the array.

Overall, the function is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the required functionality, making it correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with elements in arr.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states for the first few iterations.
    #
    #1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in `arr`.
    #
    #2. **Conditional Return**: Inside the loop, there's a conditional check `if value == element`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `True` along with the index of the matching element.
    #
    #3. **Output States Analysis**:
    #   - After the loop executes 1 time, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `value` is not equal to `element`, or the loop would have returned.
    #   - After the loop executes 2 times, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. If `value` equals `element` at any point, the function returns; otherwise, it continues.
    #   - After the loop executes 3 times, similar logic applies, with the function returning if a match is found.
    #
    #**Determining the Final Output State**:
    #
    #- **If `element` is found in `arr`**: The loop will return `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. In this case, the loop does not complete all iterations.
    #  
    #- **If `element` is not found in `arr`**: The loop will iterate over all elements in `arr` without finding a match. In this scenario, the function does not explicitly return a value, implying it returns `None` by default in many programming languages. The state of `arr`, `element`, `index`, and `value` after the loop would reflect the last iteration: `index` would be the last index of `arr`, `value` would be the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` would retain their original values since the loop does not modify them.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished (or not, in the case of an early return) can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #- If `element` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`.
    #- If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function implicitly returns `None`, with `index` being the last index of `arr`, `value` being the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` remaining unchanged.
    #
    #However, the task requires focusing on the state of variables after the loop, considering the original task's format for the answer.
    #
    #**Output State: `arr` is a list, `element` is any type of object, if `element` is in `arr`, the function returns True and the index of `element`; otherwise, the function returns None, with `index` being the last index of `arr` and `value` being the last element of `arr`.**
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False, indicating that the element was not found, and -1, representing an invalid index, signifying that the element was not located in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` searches for an `element` in a given list `arr` and returns a tuple containing a boolean value and an index. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`. The function iterates over the list using `enumerate` to access both the index and value of each element, and it stops as soon as it finds a match, making it efficient for large lists where the target element is near the beginning. The function does not modify the original list or the `element` being searched. Potential edge cases include an empty list, a list with duplicate elements (where it returns the index of the first occurrence), and searching for `None` or other special values, all of which are handled by the function's return values. If the list is empty, the function will return `False` and `-1` without throwing an error, indicating that the `element` was not found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
