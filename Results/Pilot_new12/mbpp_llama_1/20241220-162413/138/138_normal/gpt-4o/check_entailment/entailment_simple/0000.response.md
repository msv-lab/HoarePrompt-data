Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. It iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value is equal to the element. If it is, the function immediately returns `True` along with the index of the matching element.
3. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `False` and `-1`, indicating that the element was not found.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the element is found in the array, it returns `True` and the index of the element.
- If the element is not found in the array, it returns `False` and `-1`.
- It assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list and a valid element), which is specified in the problem statement.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the program's correctness for different scenarios.

Overall, the program accurately implements the required functionality and meets the problem description's requirements.
