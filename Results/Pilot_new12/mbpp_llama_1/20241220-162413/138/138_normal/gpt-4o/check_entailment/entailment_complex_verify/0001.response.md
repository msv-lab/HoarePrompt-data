Based on the provided code, problem description, original assessment, and annotated code, I believe the original assessment is accurate. 

The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). This meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The function uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the array, comparing each value to the target element. If a match is found, the function immediately returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `(False, -1)`. 

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the state of the program at different points. It confirms that the function returns `(True, index)` if the element is found and `(False, -1)` if the element is not found. The annotations also highlight that the function does not modify the original array or the element being searched.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. Without any additional examples or edge cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
