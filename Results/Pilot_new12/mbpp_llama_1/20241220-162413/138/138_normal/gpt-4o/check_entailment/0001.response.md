Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the array, comparing each value to the target element. If a match is found, the function immediately returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `(False, -1)`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

*   If the element is present in the array, the function returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the correct position of the element.
*   If the element is not present in the array, the function returns `(False, -1)`.
*   The function works correctly with empty arrays, returning `(False, -1)` for any element.
*   The function also handles duplicate elements in the array, returning the index of the first occurrence of the element.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. Without any additional examples or edge cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
