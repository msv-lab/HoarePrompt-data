The function `func_1` searches for an `element` in a given list `arr` and returns a tuple containing a boolean value and an index. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and `-1`. The function iterates over the list using `enumerate` to access both the index and value of each element, and it stops as soon as it finds a match, making it efficient for large lists where the target element is near the beginning. The function does not modify the original list or the `element` being searched. Potential edge cases include an empty list, a list with duplicate elements (where it returns the index of the first occurrence), and searching for `None` or other special values, all of which are handled by the function's return values. If the list is empty, the function will return `False` and `-1` without throwing an error, indicating that the `element` was not found.
