The given code snippet is `return False, -1`. This means that regardless of the previous state or iterations, the function will return `False` and `-1`. 

- The value `False` is a boolean indicating that the `element` was not found in `arr`.
- The value `-1` is an integer representing an index. In the context of this problem, it signifies that the `element` was not found in `arr`, as a valid index would be a non-negative integer less than the length of `arr`.

Given this information, we can conclude that the program returns `False` and `-1`, indicating that the `element` was not found in `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns False, indicating that the element was not found, and -1, representing an invalid index, signifying that the element was not located in the list.**
