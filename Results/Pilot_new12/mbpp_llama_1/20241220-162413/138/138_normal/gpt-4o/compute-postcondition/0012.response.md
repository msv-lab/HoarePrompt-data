The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list, and `element` is any type of object that can be compared with elements in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the `element` was found in the list `arr`, and an integer value representing the index of the `element` in the list if found, or -1 if not found. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and return a boolean value along with the index of the `element` in the list if it exists, or False and -1 if it does not.
