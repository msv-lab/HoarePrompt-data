Given the initial state, we have `arr` as a list with at least 1 element, `index` as 0, `value` as the first element of `arr`, and this first element (`value`) is equal to `element`. 

When the code `return True, index` is executed, it returns two values: a boolean `True` and the current value of `index`, which is 0.

Therefore, the program returns `True` (a boolean indicating a true condition) and `index`, which is 0, indicating the first position in the list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns True and 0, where 0 represents the index of the first element in the list 'arr' that is equal to 'element' and 'value'.**
