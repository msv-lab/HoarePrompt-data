You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, 'str' has 3 or more characters
```
eturn str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str' that has 3 or more characters **


Example2:
Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, `total` is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `average` is equal to `total / count`
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns average whuih is equal to total/count , where total is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list**

Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is  greater than 3 , `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns y that is greater than 3 plus 1**

Example4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states for the first few iterations.

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in `arr`.

2. **Conditional Return**: Inside the loop, there's a conditional check `if value == element`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `True` along with the index of the matching element.

3. **Output States Analysis**:
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `value` is not equal to `element`, or the loop would have returned.
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. If `value` equals `element` at any point, the function returns; otherwise, it continues.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, similar logic applies, with the function returning if a match is found.

**Determining the Final Output State**:

- **If `element` is found in `arr`**: The loop will return `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. In this case, the loop does not complete all iterations.
  
- **If `element` is not found in `arr`**: The loop will iterate over all elements in `arr` without finding a match. In this scenario, the function does not explicitly return a value, implying it returns `None` by default in many programming languages. The state of `arr`, `element`, `index`, and `value` after the loop would reflect the last iteration: `index` would be the last index of `arr`, `value` would be the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` would retain their original values since the loop does not modify them.

Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished (or not, in the case of an early return) can be summarized as follows:

- If `element` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`.
- If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function implicitly returns `None`, with `index` being the last index of `arr`, `value` being the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` remaining unchanged.

However, the task requires focusing on the state of variables after the loop, considering the original task's format for the answer.

**Output State: `arr` is a list, `element` is any type of object, if `element` is in `arr`, the function returns True and the index of `element`; otherwise, the function returns None, with `index` being the last index of `arr` and `value` being the last element of `arr`.**
```
return False, -1

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
