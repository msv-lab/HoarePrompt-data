You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with elements in arr.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states for the first few iterations.
    #
    #1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in `arr`.
    #
    #2. **Conditional Return**: Inside the loop, there's a conditional check `if value == element`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `True` along with the index of the matching element.
    #
    #3. **Output States Analysis**:
    #   - After the loop executes 1 time, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `value` is not equal to `element`, or the loop would have returned.
    #   - After the loop executes 2 times, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. If `value` equals `element` at any point, the function returns; otherwise, it continues.
    #   - After the loop executes 3 times, similar logic applies, with the function returning if a match is found.
    #
    #**Determining the Final Output State**:
    #
    #- **If `element` is found in `arr`**: The loop will return `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. In this case, the loop does not complete all iterations.
    #  
    #- **If `element` is not found in `arr`**: The loop will iterate over all elements in `arr` without finding a match. In this scenario, the function does not explicitly return a value, implying it returns `None` by default in many programming languages. The state of `arr`, `element`, `index`, and `value` after the loop would reflect the last iteration: `index` would be the last index of `arr`, `value` would be the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` would retain their original values since the loop does not modify them.
    #
    #Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished (or not, in the case of an early return) can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #- If `element` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of `element`.
    #- If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function implicitly returns `None`, with `index` being the last index of `arr`, `value` being the last element of `arr`, and `arr` and `element` remaining unchanged.
    #
    #However, the task requires focusing on the state of variables after the loop, considering the original task's format for the answer.
    #
    #**Output State: `arr` is a list, `element` is any type of object, if `element` is in `arr`, the function returns True and the index of `element`; otherwise, the function returns None, with `index` being the last index of `arr` and `value` being the last element of `arr`.**
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False, indicating that the element was not found, and -1, representing an invalid index, signifying that the element was not located in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns a boolean value along with the index of the `element` in the list if it exists, or False and -1 if it does not.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True and 0, where 0 represents the index of the first element in the list 'arr' that is equal to 'element' and 'value'.

Case_2: The program returns True and 1

Case_3: The program returns True and the index 2, where index 2 corresponds to the third element in the list 'arr'.

Case_4: The program returns False, indicating that the element was not found, and -1, representing an invalid index, signifying that the element was not located in the list.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
