Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element. The function uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which raises a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found. The `try-except` block is used to catch this exception and return the required output.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling cases where the element is present or not present in the array, and returning the correct tuple in each case. The hints also mention that the function does not modify the input array or element, which is consistent with the provided code.

One potential concern could be the handling of edge cases, such as an empty array or non-comparable elements. However, the output hints suggest that the function implicitly handles these cases through the `index()` method's behavior and exception handling. This is consistent with the provided code, which does not explicitly handle these cases but relies on the built-in `index` method to raise an exception if the element is not found.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
