The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **True**. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). This meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The annotated version of the code provides a detailed description of the program's behavior at different points in the execution. The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles various cases, including:

1. The element is in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element.
2. The element is not in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.
3. The array is empty: The function raises a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found, which is caught and handled correctly, returning `(False, -1)`.

The annotated version also highlights that the function does not modify the input array or element in any way and only performs a search operation. This ensures that the program's behavior is consistent with the problem description.

Based on the original assessment, the annotated version of the code, and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct. The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's behavior, and the annotated version provides additional evidence to support this assessment.

The reason I maintain the original assessment is that the annotated version of the code confirms the program's correctness and does not introduce any new information that would suggest the program is incorrect. The program's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and the annotated version provides a detailed description of the program's behavior at different points in the execution.

Final: **True**
