The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the given problem description. After analyzing the annotated version of the code, I agree with the original assessment. The annotated version provides a clear explanation of the program's behavior at different points, which aligns with the problem description.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element. The function uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which raises a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found. The `try-except` block is used to catch this exception and return the required output.

The annotations in the code confirm that the program behaves as expected:

1. If the element is in the array, the function returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
2. If the element is not in the array, the function returns `(False, -1)`.
3. The function handles edge cases where the array is empty or the element is not comparable for equality, implicitly handling these cases through the `index()` method's behavior and exception handling.

The annotations also confirm that the input state remains unchanged after the function execution, and the function only performs a search operation without modifying the input array or element.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the program's behavior and handles all potential cases. The annotated version of the code provides additional evidence to support the original assessment, showing that the program behaves as expected in different scenarios.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
