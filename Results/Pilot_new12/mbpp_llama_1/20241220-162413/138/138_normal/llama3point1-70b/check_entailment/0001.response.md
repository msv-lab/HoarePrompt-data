Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, the function returns `(False, -1)`.

The function uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which raises a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found. The `try-except` block is used to catch this exception and return the required output.

This program handles all potential cases:

1. If the element is in the array, the function will return `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
2. If the element is not in the array, the function will return `(False, -1)`.
3. The function works for arrays of any size, including empty arrays.
4. The function works for arrays containing elements of any data type, including integers, strings, and other types.

Since we cannot think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
