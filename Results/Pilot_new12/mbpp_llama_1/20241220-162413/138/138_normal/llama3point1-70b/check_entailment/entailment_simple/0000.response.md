Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Element found in the array**: The program uses the `index()` method to find the index of the element in the array. If the element is found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of the element. This matches the problem description's requirement.

2. **Element not found in the array**: If the element is not found, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` exception. The program catches this exception and returns `False` along with `-1`, which aligns with the problem description.

The program correctly handles every potential case as described in the problem description, assuming valid input (i.e., `array` is a list and `element` is a type of object that can be compared for equality with elements in the array). The use of a try-except block ensures that the program handles both cases where the element is found and where it's not found, providing the expected output as per the problem description.
