Correctness: **True**

The code provided for the function `func_1` accurately implements the description given in the problem. It checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array` and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The function correctly uses the `index()` method to find the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the `element` is not found, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which the function catches and returns a tuple with `False` and -1.

The output hints provided align with the behavior of the code and help confirm its correctness. The hints mention that the function handles the case where the `element` is not present in the `array` by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` along with -1, which is exactly what the code does.

The function also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty `array` and non-comparable `element` types, as the `index()` method and exception handling implicitly manage these scenarios.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles potential edge cases as implied by the output hints, and assuming valid input as per the instructions, the code is considered correct for every potential case.
