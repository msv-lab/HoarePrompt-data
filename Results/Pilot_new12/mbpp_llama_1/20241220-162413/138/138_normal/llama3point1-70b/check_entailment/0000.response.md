Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input. The function attempts to find the index of the element in the array using the `index()` method, which raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found. 

If the element is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, the function catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

This program correctly handles the following potential cases:

1. The element is in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element.
2. The element is not in the array: The function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.
3. The array is empty: The function raises a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found, which is caught and handled correctly, returning `(False, -1)`.
4. The element is the first or last element in the array: The function correctly handles these cases, returning the correct index.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, the Correctness is **True**. 

No example was found that does not work as expected according to the problem description.
