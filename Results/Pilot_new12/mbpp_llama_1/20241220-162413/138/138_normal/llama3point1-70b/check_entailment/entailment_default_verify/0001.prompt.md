You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, the function returns `(False, -1)`.

The function uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists, which raises a `ValueError` exception if the element is not found. The `try-except` block is used to catch this exception and return the required output.

This program handles all potential cases:

1. If the element is in the array, the function will return `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
2. If the element is not in the array, the function will return `(False, -1)`.
3. The function works for arrays of any size, including empty arrays.
4. The function works for arrays containing elements of any data type, including integers, strings, and other types.

Since we cannot think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array` and returns a boolean indicating whether the element was found along with the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The function handles the case where the `element` is not present in the `array` by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` along with -1. The original state of the `array` and `element` remains unchanged after the function execution, regardless of whether the `element` is found or not. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way and only performs a search operation. The return values are either `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `array`, or `False` and -1 if `element` is not found. The function handles edge cases where the `array` is empty or the `element` is not comparable for equality, implicitly handling these cases through the `index()` method's behavior and exception handling.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
