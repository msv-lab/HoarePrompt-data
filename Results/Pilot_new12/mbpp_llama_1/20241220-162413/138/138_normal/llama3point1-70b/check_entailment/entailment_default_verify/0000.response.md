Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.

The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior, including:

* The function checks if a given element exists in a provided array and returns a boolean indicating whether the element was found along with the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found.
* The function handles the case where the element is not present in the array by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` along with -1.
* The original state of the array and element remains unchanged after the function execution, regardless of whether the element is found or not.
* The function does not modify the input array or element in any way and only performs a search operation.

These output hints are consistent with the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly handles the cases where the element is in the array, not in the array, and handles edge cases such as an empty array.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the code correctly implements the required functionality, and the output hints provide additional evidence that the function behaves as expected. The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and there is no indication that the function does not meet the requirements.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
