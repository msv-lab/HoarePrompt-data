Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the described functionality. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input, then attempts to find the element in the array using the `index()` method. If the element is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the function, and it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

The code correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the hints, such as an empty array or an element that is not comparable for equality. The `index()` method's behavior and the exception handling ensure that these cases are implicitly handled.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It returns the correct results for all potential cases, including when the element is present in the array, when it is not present, and when the array is empty.

The function's behavior aligns with the provided output hints, confirming that it behaves as expected under various conditions. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the code's implementation, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
