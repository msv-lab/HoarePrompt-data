Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the `element` exists in the provided `array` using the `index()` method.
2. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` along with the index of the element, which meets the problem description's requirements.
3. If the `element` is not found, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block. The function then returns `False` and -1, which also meets the problem description's requirements.
4. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way, which is consistent with the problem description.
5. The function handles edge cases implicitly through the `index()` method's behavior and exception handling, which is sufficient given the assumption that the input will be valid.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and it does so in a way that is consistent with the assumptions made about the input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
