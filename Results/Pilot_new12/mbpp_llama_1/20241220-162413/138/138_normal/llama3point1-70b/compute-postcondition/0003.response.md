The program could raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found in the `array`, because the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` when the specified element is not found in the list. 

The try-except statement checks if the `element` is present in the `array`. If it is present, the function returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the `array`. If it is not present, the function catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `False` along with `-1` as the index.

Therefore: 
Output State: **array is a list of elements, and element is any type of object that can be compared for equality with elements in the array. If the element is found in the array, the function returns True and the index of the element, otherwise, it returns False and -1.**
