Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if a given `element` exists in a provided `array` and returns a boolean indicating whether the element was found along with the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The function handles the case where the `element` is not present in the `array` by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` along with -1. The original state of the `array` and `element` remains unchanged after the function execution, regardless of whether the `element` is found or not. The function does not modify the input `array` or `element` in any way and only performs a search operation. The return values are either `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `array`, or `False` and -1 if `element` is not found. The function handles edge cases where the `array` is empty or the `element` is not comparable for equality, implicitly handling these cases through the `index()` method's behavior and exception handling.**
