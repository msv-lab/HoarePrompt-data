The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. `array` is a list of elements, and `element` is any type of object that can be compared for equality with elements in the `array`. After executing the function body, if the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the `array`, it returns `False` along with `-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `array` and an `element`, and return a boolean indicating whether the `element` is in the `array` along with its index if found, or `-1` if not found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` and an `element`, returns `True` and the index of the `element` if it exists in the `array`, otherwise returns `False` and `-1`.**
