Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`. The function utilizes the built-in string method `count`, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of its argument in the string. This method is case-sensitive and does not modify the original string.

The function handles various edge cases correctly, such as when 'std' does not appear in the string (returning 0), appears multiple times (returning the total count), or when the input string is empty (returning 0). The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the function's behavior for different input scenarios.

Given that we assume the input will be a valid string, the function does not need to perform any error checking on the input type. Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also confirm the function's behavior and do not indicate any discrepancies with the code.
