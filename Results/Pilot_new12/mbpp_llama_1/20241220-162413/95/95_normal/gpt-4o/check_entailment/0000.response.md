Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, uses the built-in string method `count` to find the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. This approach directly aligns with the problem description to count the occurrences of 'std'. The `count` method is case-sensitive and does not overlap counts, meaning it will only count each distinct occurrence of 'std' and not count substrings that overlap (e.g., 'stdstd' will be counted as two occurrences).

The function handles various test cases correctly, including empty strings, strings containing 'std' multiple times, and strings containing 'std' followed by characters that could potentially lead to an overlap but are correctly handled by the `count` method.

Given the straightforward nature of the `count` method and its alignment with the problem description, along with the successful passing of the provided test cases, it appears that the function correctly counts the occurrences of 'std' in all potential cases. Without a specifically identified case where the function fails to meet the problem description, the conclusion is that the function is correct.
