Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

The function uses the `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring in the string. In this case, the substring is 'std', so the function returns the number of times 'std' appears in the input string `s`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various cases, including strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', strings with only one occurrence of 'std', and empty strings.

In general, the `count` method will work correctly for all valid inputs, because it simply scans the string and counts the number of occurrences of the specified substring. Therefore, the function will always do what the problem description asks for every potential case.
