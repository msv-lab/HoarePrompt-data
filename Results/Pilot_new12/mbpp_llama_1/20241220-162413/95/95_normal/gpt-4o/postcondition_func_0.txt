The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`, regardless of the case or position of 'std' in the string, and does not modify the original string. It handles edge cases where 'std' does not appear in the string (returning 0), appears multiple times (returning the total count), or when the input string is empty (returning 0). The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the user will always provide a string. After the function concludes, the original string remains unchanged, and the return value represents the total count of 'std' substrings found in the input string.
