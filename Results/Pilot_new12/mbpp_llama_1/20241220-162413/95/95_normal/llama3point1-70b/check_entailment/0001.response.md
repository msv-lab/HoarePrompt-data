Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified value.

For example, `func_1('stdstdstd')` will return `3`, `func_1('hello std world')` will return `1`, and `func_1('abcdef')` will return `0`. 

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including empty strings, strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', and strings with no occurrences of 'std'. 

It does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it is not handling. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
