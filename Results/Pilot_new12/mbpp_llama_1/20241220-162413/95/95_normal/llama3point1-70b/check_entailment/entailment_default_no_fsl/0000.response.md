Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`. The `count` method of Python strings is used to achieve this, which counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string `s`. 

The output hints provided suggest that the function behaves as expected, handling strings of any length and content without modification and providing a count result as an integer value, including zero occurrences if 'std' is not found in `s`. 

Since we assume that the input will be a valid string and will not cause any errors in the program, and considering that the `count` method correctly counts all occurrences of 'std' in any string, the function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. 

There are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected according to the description provided, making the program correct under the given assumptions.
