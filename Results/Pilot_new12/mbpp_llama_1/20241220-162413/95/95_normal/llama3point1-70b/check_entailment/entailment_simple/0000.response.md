Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it directly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The `func_1` function takes a string `s` as input and uses the built-in `count` method of Python strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within `s`. This method is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'std', 'Std', 'STD', etc., as different strings, which aligns with the problem description's lack of specificity regarding case sensitivity.

The `count` method searches the string for all non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring and returns the number of occurrences. Since the problem description asks for a function to count the number of occurrences of the string `'std'` in a given string, and the program does exactly that without any conditions or exceptions that would alter this behavior for valid inputs, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, for every potential case where a valid string is passed as an argument, `func_1` will return the correct count of `'std'` occurrences, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
