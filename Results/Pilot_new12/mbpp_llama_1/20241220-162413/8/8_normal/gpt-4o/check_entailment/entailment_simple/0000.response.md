Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it removes all characters between the first and last occurrence of the given character, instead of just removing the first and last occurrence of the character.

For example, if the input string is "abcabc" and the character is 'a', the program will return "bc", which is incorrect. The correct output should be "bcabc".

The problem description asks to remove only the first and last occurrence of the given character, but the program removes the entire substring between the first and last occurrence.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

However, this code can still be improved to correctly implement the problem description. A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

can be improved by using the replace() function to replace the first occurrence of the character, then replace the last occurrence, this can be done by the following python code:

```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]
```

is not the best implementation and it can be rewritten as follows:

```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    s = s.replace(ch, "", 1)
    s = s[::-1].replace(ch, "", 1)[::-1]
    return s
```
this will first remove the first occurrence of the character then remove the last occurrence of the character from the string `s`. 

This implementation first removes the first occurrence of the character, then reverses the string and removes the first occurrence of the character (which is now the last occurrence in the original string), and finally reverses the string back to its original order.

This implementation meets the problem description and is a more correct and efficient solution.
