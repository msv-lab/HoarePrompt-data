Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The function `func_1` uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If the character is not present in the string or appears only once, the function returns the original string. If the character appears at least twice in the string, the function removes the first and last occurrences of the character and returns the resulting string.

The code handles edge cases where the character is not found in the string or appears only once, and the returned string will be either the original string or the modified string with the first and last occurrences of the character removed. The output hints agree with the code and demonstrate its correctness.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function for different scenarios, including when the character appears multiple times, only once, or not at all. Based on the code, output hints, and unit tests, it can be concluded that the function behaves as expected and correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string in all potential cases.
