Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The function uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to get the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character, respectively. If the character is not found in the string, or if the first and last indices are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), the function returns the original string.

The function handles edge cases correctly:

* If the character is not found in the string (`first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`), the function returns the original string.
* If the character appears only once in the string (`first_index` equals `last_index`), the function returns the original string.
* If the character appears multiple times in the string, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function.

After reviewing the code and considering potential edge cases, I could not find any scenario where the function would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
