Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

Here's a breakdown of the function's logic:

1. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(ch)`.
2. Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`) or if the character appears only once in the string (i.e., `first_index` equals `last_index`), it returns the original string.
4. Otherwise, it constructs a new string by concatenating three parts:
   - The substring before the first occurrence of the character (`s[:first_index]`).
   - The substring between the first and last occurrences of the character, excluding the character itself (`s[first_index + 1:last_index]`).
   - The substring after the last occurrence of the character (`s[last_index + 1:]`).

This approach correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string, while preserving all other characters.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases. After analyzing the function's logic and considering different potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
