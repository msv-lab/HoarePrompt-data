Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and follows the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` and a character `ch` as input, and returns a modified string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. 

The function first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s` (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`) or appears only once (i.e., `first_index` equals `last_index`), the function returns the original string `s`. 

If `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, the function returns a modified string that is a concatenation of the parts of `s` before the first `ch`, between the first and last `ch` (excluding these `ch` characters), and after the last `ch`. This is achieved by using string slicing: `s[:first_index]` gets the substring before the first `ch`, `s[first_index + 1:last_index]` gets the substring between the first and last `ch` (excluding these `ch` characters), and `s[last_index + 1:]` gets the substring after the last `ch`.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for different cases. For example, `assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'` shows that the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences of 'l' from the string 'hello', and `assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'` shows that the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences of 'a' from the string 'abcda'. 

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
