Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the program returns the string with the first and last occurrences of the character removed, but it also removes all the characters between the first and last occurrences of the character, excluding the first and last occurrences.

For example, if the input string is "abcda" and the character is "a", the program will return "bcd" which is correct. However, if the input string is "abaca" and the character is "a", the program will return "bc" which is incorrect because it should return "baca".

The correct program should remove only the first and last occurrences of the character, not the characters between them. 

Here's the correct code:

```python
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index:]
```

This code first finds the first and last indices of the character in the string. If the character is not found or appears only once, it returns the original string. If the character appears at least twice, it removes the first occurrence of the character and keeps the rest of the string until the last occurrence of the character, then appends the rest of the string after the last occurrence.
