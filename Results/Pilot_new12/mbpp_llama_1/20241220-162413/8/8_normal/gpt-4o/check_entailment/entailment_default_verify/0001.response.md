The original assessment states that the provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. This assessment is supported by the function's logic, which:

1. Finds the first and last indices of the character in the string.
2. Returns the original string if the character is not found or appears only once.
3. Constructs a new string by concatenating three parts: before the first occurrence, between the first and last occurrences (excluding the character), and after the last occurrence.

The output hints also align with the function's behavior, indicating that the function:

1. Accepts a string and a character.
2. Returns the original string if the character is not present or appears only once.
3. Removes the first and last occurrences of the character if it appears at least twice.

Given the consistency between the function's logic and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly handles edge cases, and the returned string will be either the original string or the modified string with the first and last occurrences of the character removed.

The output hints also provide examples of the expected behavior, which matches the function's implementation. Therefore, I conclude that the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness of the original assessment.

Final: **True**
