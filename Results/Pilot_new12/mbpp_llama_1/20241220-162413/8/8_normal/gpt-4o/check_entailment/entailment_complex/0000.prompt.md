You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string such that ch is present at least once in s.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns string 's' which contains character 'ch' with the first occurrence at index 'first_index' and the last occurrence at index 'last_index', where 'first_index' is either -1 (if 'ch' is not found), or 'first_index' equals 'last_index' (if 'ch' appears only once), and 'last_index' is also either -1 (if 'ch' is not found) or equals 'first_index' (if 'ch' appears only once)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string present in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. Additionally, `first_index` is not equal to -1, `last_index` is not equal to -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, indicating that `ch` appears at least twice in `s` and both the first and last occurrences are valid indices.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a string that is a modified version of `s`, where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are removed, and the parts of `s` before the first `ch`, between the first and last `ch` (excluding these `ch` characters), and after the last `ch` are concatenated together.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a modified string. If `ch` is not present in `s` or appears only once, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, the function removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` and returns the resulting string, which is a concatenation of the parts of `s` before the first `ch`, between the first and last `ch` (excluding these `ch` characters), and after the last `ch`. The function handles edge cases where `ch` is not found in `s` or appears only once, and the returned string will be either the original string or the modified string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
