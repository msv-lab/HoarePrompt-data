The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a modified string. If `ch` is not present in `s` or appears only once, the function returns the original string `s`. If `ch` appears at least twice in `s`, the function removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` and returns the resulting string, which is a concatenation of the parts of `s` before the first `ch`, between the first and last `ch` (excluding these `ch` characters), and after the last `ch`. The function handles edge cases where `ch` is not found in `s` or appears only once, and the returned string will be either the original string or the modified string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.
