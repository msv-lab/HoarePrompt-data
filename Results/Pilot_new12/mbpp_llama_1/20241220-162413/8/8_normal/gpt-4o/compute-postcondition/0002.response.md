Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. The current value of `first_index` is either -1 (indicating `ch` is not found in `s`), or `last_index` is -1 (also indicating `ch` is not found in `s`), or `first_index` equals `last_index` (meaning `ch` appears only once in `s`).**
