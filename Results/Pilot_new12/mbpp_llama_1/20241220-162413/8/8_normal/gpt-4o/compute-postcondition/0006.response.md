The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. `s` is a string and `ch` is a single character string. The function returns a value based on two cases. 

In Case_1, it returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrence indices of `ch`. 

In Case_2, it returns a modified string where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are removed, and the remaining parts of `s` are concatenated together.

However, since the task mentions that if one case is fulfilled, none of the others are, it implies an 'if-else' or similar conditional logic structure within the function, but that detail is irrelevant to describing the functionality.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return either the original string with the first and last indices of `ch` or a modified string with the first and last `ch` removed, depending on the case that is fulfilled.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns either the original string with the first and last occurrence indices of `ch` or a modified string where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are removed.**
