`last_index` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` using the `rfind` method. The values of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` are not affected by this operation. The `rfind` method returns the highest index of the substring `ch` in `s`, which is the last occurrence of `ch`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string present in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
