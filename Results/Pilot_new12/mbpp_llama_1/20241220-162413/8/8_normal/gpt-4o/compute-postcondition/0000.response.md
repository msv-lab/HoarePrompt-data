To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

`s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string such that `ch` is present at least once in `s`. The code `first_index = s.find(ch)` finds the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.

Since `ch` is present at least once in `s`, `s.find(ch)` will return the index of the first occurrence of `ch`, which is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string present in `s`, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
