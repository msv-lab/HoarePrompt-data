To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. `s` is a string.
2. `ch` is a single character string present in `s`.
3. `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and it is not equal to -1, indicating that `ch` is indeed found in `s`.
4. `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and it is not equal to -1, confirming that `ch` is present in `s`.
5. `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, meaning that `ch` appears at least twice in `s`.

The code provided is:
```python
return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

This code snippet returns a new string that is constructed by concatenating three parts of the original string `s`:

1. `s[:first_index]`: This part includes all characters from the beginning of `s` up to but not including the first occurrence of `ch`.
2. `s[first_index + 1:last_index]`: This part includes all characters from the position right after the first occurrence of `ch` up to but not including the last occurrence of `ch`.
3. `s[last_index + 1:]`: This part includes all characters from the position right after the last occurrence of `ch` to the end of the string `s`.

Given the information about `s`, `ch`, `first_index`, and `last_index`, the returned string effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s`, along with any characters between these occurrences (inclusive of the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`), but since `ch` appears at least twice and these indices are of the first and last occurrences, what's actually removed are the first and last `ch` and any characters in between these two indices are kept except for the `ch` at `first_index` and `last_index`.

Output State: **The program returns a string that is a modified version of `s`, where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are removed, and the parts of `s` before the first `ch`, between the first and last `ch` (excluding these `ch` characters), and after the last `ch` are concatenated together.**
