The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `char` as input and returns a modified string based on the removal of `char` from `s`. The function checks if `char` exists in `s` and determines its first and last occurrences. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it removes the single occurrence and returns the modified string. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes both the first and last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string. However, if `char` does not exist in `s` or is an empty string, or if the input string `s` is empty, the function will return the original string `s` as it is, without any modifications. Additionally, the function handles the case where `char` is `None` or is not a single character, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations, the code will still execute and return the original string `s` or an error if not handled properly. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it assumes that `s` is a string and `char` is a single character. The final state of the program after it concludes will be one of three possible return cases: a string without `char`, a string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, or the original string `s` if `char` does not exist in `s` or if `s` or `char` is empty.
