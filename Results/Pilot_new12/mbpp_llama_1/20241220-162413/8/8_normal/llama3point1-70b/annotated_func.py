#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character that exists at least twice in s.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns a string where the character `char` has been removed from its original position in string `s`, resulting in a modified string `s` without `char`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, `char` is a character that exists at least twice in `s`, and the removal is based on the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns string `s` that contains a character `char` which exists at least twice in `s`, with `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` having values that may or may not represent the actual indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s` due to the possibility of being -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `char` as input and returns a modified string based on the removal of `char` from `s`. The function checks if `char` exists in `s` and determines its first and last occurrences. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it removes the single occurrence and returns the modified string. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes both the first and last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string. However, if `char` does not exist in `s` or is an empty string, or if the input string `s` is empty, the function will return the original string `s` as it is, without any modifications. Additionally, the function handles the case where `char` is `None` or is not a single character, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations, the code will still execute and return the original string `s` or an error if not handled properly. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it assumes that `s` is a string and `char` is a single character. The final state of the program after it concludes will be one of three possible return cases: a string without `char`, a string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, or the original string `s` if `char` does not exist in `s` or if `s` or `char` is empty.
