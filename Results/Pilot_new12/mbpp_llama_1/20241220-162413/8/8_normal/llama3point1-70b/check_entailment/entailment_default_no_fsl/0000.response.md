Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements in the problem description, which is to write a Python function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. 

The code handles all the potential cases as described in the problem description. It checks if the character exists in the string and determines its first and last occurrences. If the character appears only once in the string, it removes the single occurrence and returns the modified string. If the character appears more than once in the string, it removes both the first and last occurrences of the character and returns the resulting string.

For example, if we call `func_1("hello world", "l")`, it will return "heo word". If we call `func_1("hello", "l")`, it will return "heo". If we call `func_1("hello", "x")`, it will return "hello".

Additionally, the function handles cases where the character does not exist in the string, or where the input string or character is empty. It returns the original string in these cases, as expected.

The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the code is correct and handles every potential case as expected.
