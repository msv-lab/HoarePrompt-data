To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze what the program does and compare it to the requirements specified.

The problem description asks for a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

Here's a breakdown of what the provided function `func_1` does:

1. **Find First and Last Occurrence**: It uses the `find()` and `rfind()` methods to get the indices of the first and last occurrences of the given character in the string, respectively.

2. **Check for Existence**: If the character exists at least twice, it has conditions to handle two cases:
   - If the character appears only once in the string (i.e., `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it removes this single occurrence using the `replace()` method with a count of 1. This partially aligns with the problem description because the problem asks for the removal of both the first and last occurrence, but in the case of a single occurrence, there's an implication to remove it as it's both the first and the last.
   - If the character appears more than once, it manually constructs a new string that excludes the characters at the indices of the first and last occurrences. This directly aligns with the problem description.

3. **Handle Non-Existent or Single Character**: If the character does not exist in the string, or the `find()` and `rfind()` methods return -1 for any reason, it simply returns the original string. However, given the assumptions about valid input, this aspect is less critical for the correctness evaluation regarding the problem description's specific requirements.

Considering these points, the program appears to align well with the problem description's requirements for removing the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string, handling the case where the character appears only once by removing that instance.

Therefore, the correctness of the program, assuming valid inputs and based on the problem description, can be evaluated as follows:

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it effectively removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string, adhering to the problem description's requirements under the assumption of valid inputs. It handles the case of a character appearing only once by removing that single occurrence, which can be seen as a reasonable interpretation of the problem statement's intent for such a scenario.
