You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `char` as input and returns a modified string based on the removal of `char` from `s`. The function checks if `char` exists in `s` and determines its first and last occurrences. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it removes the single occurrence and returns the modified string. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes both the first and last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string. However, if `char` does not exist in `s` or is an empty string, or if the input string `s` is empty, the function will return the original string `s` as it is, without any modifications. Additionally, the function handles the case where `char` is `None` or is not a single character, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations, the code will still execute and return the original string `s` or an error if not handled properly. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters, so it assumes that `s` is a string and `char` is a single character. The final state of the program after it concludes will be one of three possible return cases: a string without `char`, a string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, or the original string `s` if `char` does not exist in `s` or if `s` or `char` is empty.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
