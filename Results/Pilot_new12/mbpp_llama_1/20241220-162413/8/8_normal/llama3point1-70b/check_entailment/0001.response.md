Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. After analyzing the code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly.

Here's why:

1. **Handling first and last occurrence:** The function uses `find` and `rfind` methods to locate the first and last occurrence of the given character. If both occurrences exist (i.e., `first_occurrence!= -1` and `last_occurrence!= -1`), it then checks if they are the same (i.e., the character appears only once in the string).

2. **Single occurrence:** If the character appears only once (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), it uses `replace` with a count of 1 to remove this single occurrence.

3. **Multiple occurrences:** If the character appears more than once, it constructs a new string that excludes the first and last occurrences of the character by concatenating substrings around these occurrences.

4. **Character not found:** If the character does not exist in the string (`first_occurrence == -1` or `last_occurrence == -1`), the function simply returns the original string, as there are no occurrences to remove.

The function handles edge cases and adheres to its description without any identifiable flaws or omissions. Therefore, it is considered correct for all potential inputs and cases.
