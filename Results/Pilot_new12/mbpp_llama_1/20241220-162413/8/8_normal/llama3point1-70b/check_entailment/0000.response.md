Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(s, char)` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It finds the first occurrence of the character in the string using `s.find(char)`.
2. It finds the last occurrence of the character in the string using `s.rfind(char)`.
3. If both occurrences are found (i.e., they are not -1), it checks if they are the same index.
   - If they are the same (meaning there's only one occurrence of the character in the string), it uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to remove the character. 
   - If they are different (meaning there are multiple occurrences of the character in the string), it uses string slicing to remove the first and last occurrences.
4. If the character is not found in the string (i.e., either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is -1), it simply returns the original string.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty string
* String with no occurrences of the character
* String with one occurrence of the character
* String with multiple occurrences of the character
* Edge cases where the character is at the start or end of the string

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and does not have any missing logic or edge cases, it is considered correct.
