Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description in all potential cases. Here's why:

1.  If the character `char` appears more than once in the string `s`, the program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`. This is achieved by using the `find` and `rfind` methods to get the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char`, and then slicing the string to exclude these occurrences.

2.  If `char` appears only once in `s`, the program correctly removes the single occurrence of `char`. This is handled by the `if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence)` condition, which uses the `replace` method to remove the single occurrence of `char`.

3.  The program does not explicitly check for cases where `s` or `char` is empty, or where `char` is not a single character. However, as per the problem statement, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

4.  The program also returns the original string `s` if `char` does not exist in `s`, which aligns with the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string, as described in the problem description, for all valid input cases.
