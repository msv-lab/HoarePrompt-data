Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if the character `char` exists in the string `s` and determines its first and last occurrences. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it removes the single occurrence and returns the modified string. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it removes both the first and last occurrences of `char` and returns the resulting string. The function handles the case where `char` does not exist in `s` or is an empty string, or if the input string `s` is empty, by returning the original string `s` as it is, without any modifications. The output hints agree with the code and do not provide any examples where the code does not work correctly. 

The function also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `s` is an empty string or `char` is not found in `s`, it returns the original string `s`. Additionally, the function handles the case where `char` appears only once in `s` by removing the single occurrence.

Since the code handles all the potential cases and the output hints agree with the code, and we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code seems to be correct and the Correctness is **True**. 

However, it is worth noting that the code does not perform any error checking on the input parameters. But according to the task description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, so the lack of error checking does not affect the correctness of the code in this case.
