The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. `s` is a string, and `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`. After executing the function body, the function returns a modified string based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: If the function removes all occurrences of `char` from `s`, it returns the modified string `s` without `char`.
Case_2: If the function removes the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s`, it returns the derived string with these occurrences removed.
Case_3: If the function does not modify `s` and returns the original string, it may return `s` as is, depending on the values of `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `char`, and return a modified string `s` based on the removal of `char` from its original position in `s`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`, and returns a modified string based on the removal of `char` from `s`, with possible return cases including a string without `char`, a string with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, or the original string `s`.**
