To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `s` is a string.
- `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`.
- `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and is not equal to -1.
- `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` and is not equal to -1.
- The current value of `first_occurrence` is equal to the current value of `last_occurrence`, meaning the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s` are the same index.

Code:
```python
return s.replace(char, '', 1)
```

This code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in string `s` with an empty string, effectively removing it, and then returns the resulting string.

Given that `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, it means there's only one occurrence of `char` in `s` because if there were more, the last occurrence would be at a different index than the first. However, this contradicts the initial statement that `char` exists at least twice in `s`, unless the condition of `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence` implies a specific scenario where the character's first and last occurrence being the same is due to there being only one occurrence.

Therefore, considering the instruction and the logical inconsistency in the initial conditions, we proceed with the understanding that `char` appears at least once in `s`, and its first occurrence is also its last due to the given equality of indices.

When `s.replace(char, '', 1)` is executed:
- It removes the first occurrence of `char` from `s`.
- Since the first occurrence of `char` is also its last occurrence (as per the given conditions), this means `char` will be completely removed from `s` because there's effectively only one instance of it to remove.

Output State: **The program returns a string where the character `char` has been removed from its original position in string `s`, resulting in a modified string `s` without `char`.**
