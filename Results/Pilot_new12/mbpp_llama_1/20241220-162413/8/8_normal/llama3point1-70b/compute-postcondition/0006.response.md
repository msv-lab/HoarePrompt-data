To calculate the output state, let's break down the given return statement and the initial state.

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `s` is a string.
- `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`.
- `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and is not equal to -1.
- `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` and is not equal to -1.
- `first_occurrence` is not equal to `last_occurrence`, indicating that `char` appears at least twice in `s` at different positions.

The return statement is:
```python
return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
```

Let's analyze this statement step by step:
1. `s[:first_occurrence]`: This part of the statement returns a substring of `s` from the beginning of `s` up to but not including the character at the index `first_occurrence`. This effectively excludes the first occurrence of `char` from the substring.

2. `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`: This part returns a substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after the first occurrence of `char` (at index `first_occurrence + 1`) up to but not including the character at the index `last_occurrence`. This means it includes all characters between the first and last occurrences of `char` but excludes both the first and last occurrences themselves.

3. `s[last_occurrence + 1:]`: This part returns a substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after the last occurrence of `char` (at index `last_occurrence + 1`) to the end of `s`. This effectively excludes the last occurrence of `char` from the substring.

By concatenating these three substrings, the return statement effectively returns a new string that is derived from `s` but with both the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.

Output State: **The program returns a string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed, where `s` is the original string, `char` is a character that exists at least twice in `s`, and the removal is based on the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`.**
