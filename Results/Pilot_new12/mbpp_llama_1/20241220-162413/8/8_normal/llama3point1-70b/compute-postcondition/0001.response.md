The code `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` assigns the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` to the variable `last_occurrence`. Since `char` exists at least twice in `s`, `last_occurrence` will be greater than or equal to `first_occurrence`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists at least twice in `s`, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.**
