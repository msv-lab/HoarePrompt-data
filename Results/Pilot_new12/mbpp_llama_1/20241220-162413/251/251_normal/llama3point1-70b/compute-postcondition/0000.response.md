The given Python code calculates the Euclidean norm, `r`, of the variables `x` and `y` using the `math.hypot` function. 

`r` is assigned the value of the square root of `x` squared plus `y` squared, i.e., `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.

The initial state states that `x` and `y` are real numbers. The states of `x` and `y` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is equal to the square root of `x` squared plus `y` squared.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is equal to sqrt(`x`^2 + `y`^2)**
