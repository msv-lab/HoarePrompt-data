`phi` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which is the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Since `r` is equal to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, this relationship remains unchanged. 
The value of `phi` is equal to the angle in the Cartesian plane, with `x` and `y` as the adjacent and opposite sides, respectively. Therefore, `phi` is the angle whose tangent is `y/x`.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is equal to sqrt(`x`^2 + `y`^2), `phi` is equal to math.atan2(`y`, `x`)**
