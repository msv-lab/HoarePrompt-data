The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns two values: `r`, the distance from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`), and `phi`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to (`x`, `y`), both derived from the real numbers `x` and `y`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y`, and return the distance `r` and angle `phi` based on the input coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are real numbers, and returns the distance r and angle phi.**
