Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(x, y)` correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function uses the `math.hypot(x, y)` function to calculate the magnitude `r` of the polar coordinate and the `math.atan2(y, x)` function to calculate the angle `phi` in radians.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

1. The origin (0, 0): In this case, `r` will be 0 and `phi` will be 0, which is correct.
2. Points on the positive x-axis: In this case, `phi` will be 0, which is correct.
3. Points on the positive y-axis: In this case, `phi` will be Ï€/2, which is correct.
4. Points in all four quadrants: The `math.atan2(y, x)` function correctly handles the signs of `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant.
5. Large and small values of `x` and `y`: The `math.hypot(x, y)` function is designed to handle a wide range of values for `x` and `y`, and the `math.atan2(y, x)` function can handle small values of `x` and `y`.

Overall, the function is well-written and correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, making it correct for all potential cases.
