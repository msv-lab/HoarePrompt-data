You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns `r`, the distance from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`), and `phi`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to (`x`, `y`), both derived from the real numbers `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two real number parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing two values: `r`, the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`), and `phi`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to (`x`, `y`). The function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the corresponding distance and angle. The returned distance `r` is always non-negative, while the angle `phi` is in the range [-π, π]. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-real number inputs. After the function concludes, the input variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the returned values `r` and `phi` represent the calculated distance and angle, respectively.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
