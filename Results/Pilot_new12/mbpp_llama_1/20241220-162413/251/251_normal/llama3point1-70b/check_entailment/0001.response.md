Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angular coordinate `phi`. 

The `math.hypot` function is used to calculate the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. This correctly calculates the radial distance `r` in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function is used to calculate the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The `atan2` function is used instead of `atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. It also correctly handles the quadrant of the point `(x, y)`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles edge cases such as `(0, 0)`, `(0, y)`, `(x, 0)`, and `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are positive or negative. 

For example, `func_1(3, 4)` returns `(5.0, 0.9272952180016122)`, which are the correct polar coordinates for the point `(3, 4)`. 

Therefore, the program is correct and the correctness is **True**.
