Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as described in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The problem description asks for a function to convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) and φ is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to (x, y).

2. The program uses the `math.hypot(x, y)` function to calculate the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is correctly assigned to the variable `r`. The `math.hypot(x, y)` function returns the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y), which is the correct formula for calculating the distance from the origin to a point in rectangular coordinates.

3. The program uses the `math.atan2(y, x)` function to calculate the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to (x, y), which is correctly assigned to the variable `phi`. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function returns the angle in radians in the correct quadrant based on the signs of `y` and `x`, which is the correct formula for calculating the angle in polar coordinates.

4. The program returns both `r` and `phi`, which are the required polar coordinates. 

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and hence it's correct.
