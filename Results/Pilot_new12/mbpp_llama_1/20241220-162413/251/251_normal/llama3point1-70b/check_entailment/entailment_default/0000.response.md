Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` calculates the Euclidean distance `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)` and the angle `phi` using `math.atan2(y, x)`. This approach ensures that the function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the corresponding distance and angle.

The `math.hypot(x, y)` function calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function returns the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to `(x, y)`, which is in the range `[-π, π]`.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y` and returns the correct distance and angle. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code is correct for every potential case. 

Note that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-real number inputs, but according to the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid. Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
