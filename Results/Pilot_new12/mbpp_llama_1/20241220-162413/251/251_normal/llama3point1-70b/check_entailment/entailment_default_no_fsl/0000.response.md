Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a function that converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two real number parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing the Euclidean distance `r` and the angle `phi` in radians.

The code correctly calculates `r` using the `math.hypot` function, which returns the Euclidean norm, and `phi` using the `math.atan2` function, which returns the arc tangent of `y/x` in radians. The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, and to ensure that the angle is in the correct quadrant.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, indicating that the function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero and negative values, and returns the corresponding distance and angle.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking or handling for non-real number inputs does not affect the correctness of the code.

Overall, the code correctly implements the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates, and there are no cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
