You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

Here's why:

1. The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the radius `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, which is correct according to the definition of polar coordinates.

2. The function calculates the angle `theta` using `theta = atan2(y, x)`, which is also correct. The `atan2` function is used instead of `atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, and to get the correct quadrant for the angle.

3. The function returns both `r` and `theta`, which are the two components of polar coordinates.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After examining the code and considering potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: This function calculates and returns the polar coordinates of a point given its Cartesian coordinates. It accepts two real number parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns a tuple containing the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`) and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to (`x`, `y`). The function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero, positive, and negative values, and returns the corresponding `r` and `theta` values. For the edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will return `r = 0` and `theta = 0` because `math.atan2(0, 0)` is defined to return 0 in Python. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs are always real numbers. The state of the program after it concludes is that the original `x` and `y` values remain unchanged, and the function returns a tuple containing the calculated `r` and `theta` values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
