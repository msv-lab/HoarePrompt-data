Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The `math.atan2` function is used to calculate the angle `theta` in radians, which handles the quadrant correctly. The `math.sqrt` function calculates the radius `r`.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

* When `x` and `y` are both positive, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle in the first quadrant.
* When `x` is negative and `y` is positive, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle in the second quadrant.
* When `x` and `y` are both negative, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle in the third quadrant.
* When `x` is positive and `y` is negative, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle in the fourth quadrant.
* When `x` is 0, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle (`pi/2` or `-pi/2`) depending on the sign of `y`.
* When `y` is 0, `math.atan2` returns the correct angle (0 or `pi`) depending on the sign of `x`.

The provided unit tests also pass, confirming the correctness of the function. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
