Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`) using the formula `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to (`x`, `y`) using `math.atan2(y, x)`. 

This function handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero, positive, and negative values, and returns the corresponding `r` and `theta` values. For the edge case where both `x` and `y` are zero, the function returns `r = 0` and `theta = 0` as defined by `math.atan2(0, 0)` in Python.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) validate the function's correctness for various input cases. 

Since the problem description assumes that the input will be valid and the function correctly handles all real number inputs, the code is considered correct according to the problem description. 

No cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for all valid input cases.
