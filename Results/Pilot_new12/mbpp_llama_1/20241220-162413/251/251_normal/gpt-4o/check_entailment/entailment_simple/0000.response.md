Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

The function `func_1` takes in two arguments, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates. It calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to `(x, y)` using the `math.atan2` function.

The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. The `math.atan2` function also correctly handles the quadrant of the angle, which is not possible with `math.atan`.

The function returns a tuple containing `r` and `theta`, which are the polar coordinates of the point `(x, y)`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, and the calculations are accurate.

In general, this program will always correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, given valid input, and it follows the problem description.
