Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

Here's why:

1. The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the radius `r` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, which is correct according to the definition of polar coordinates.

2. The function calculates the angle `theta` using `theta = atan2(y, x)`, which is also correct. The `atan2` function is used instead of `atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, and to get the correct quadrant for the angle.

3. The function returns both `r` and `theta`, which are the two components of polar coordinates.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After examining the code and considering potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
