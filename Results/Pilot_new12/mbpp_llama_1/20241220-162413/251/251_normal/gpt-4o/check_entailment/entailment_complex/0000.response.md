Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes in two real numbers `x` and `y` as input, calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula `r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, and calculates the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to `(x, y)` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function.

The program handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`, including zero, positive, and negative values. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function is used instead of `math.atan(y/x)` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. Additionally, `math.atan2(y, x)` returns the correct quadrant for the angle `theta`, which is not always the case with `math.atan(y/x)`.

The function returns a tuple containing the calculated `r` and `theta` values, which matches the expected output format specified in the problem description. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input values.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and it handles all possible real number inputs for `x` and `y`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
