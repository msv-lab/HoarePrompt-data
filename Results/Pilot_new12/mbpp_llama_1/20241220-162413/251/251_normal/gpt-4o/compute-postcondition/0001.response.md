To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given Python code on the variables `x`, `y`, `r`, and the newly introduced variable `theta`.

The code `theta = math.atan2(y, x)` calculates the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero and to preserve the sign of the result based on the signs of `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are real numbers.
- `r` is equal to √(`x`² + `y`²), which represents the distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` in a Cartesian coordinate system.

The calculation of `theta` does not change the values of `x`, `y`, or `r`. It only introduces a new variable `theta` that represents the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `x` remains a real number.
- `y` remains a real number.
- `r` remains equal to √(`x`² + `y`²).
- `theta` is introduced and equals `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians.

Since `r` is the distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `theta` is the angle from the positive x-axis to this line segment, `r` and `theta` together represent the point `(x, y)` in polar coordinates.

Output State: **`x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `r` is equal to √(`x`² + `y`²), and `theta` equals `math.atan2(y, x)`.**
