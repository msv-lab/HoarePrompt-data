The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing two values: `r`, the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`), and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to (`x`, `y`). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are real numbers, and returns a tuple containing the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y) and the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to (x, y).**
