The value of `r` is assigned the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is the square root of `x` squared plus `y` squared.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers, `r` is equal to √(`x`² + `y`²)**
