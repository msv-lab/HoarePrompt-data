#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The function returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` equals the original value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the length of the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) equals `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers starting from `k=1` until it finds a match, at which point it returns the corresponding `k`. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns a single integer value `k`, without any side effects. The actual return values are not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather depend on the input `n` and the properties of triangular numbers. The function will run indefinitely if no such `k` is found, but in practice, it will always terminate for any given positive integer `n` because the length of the string representation of triangular numbers increases without bound as `k` increases.
