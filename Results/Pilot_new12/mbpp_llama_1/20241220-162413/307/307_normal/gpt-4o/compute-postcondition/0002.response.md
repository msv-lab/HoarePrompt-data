The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 1, we can calculate `triangular_number` as `1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, and `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
