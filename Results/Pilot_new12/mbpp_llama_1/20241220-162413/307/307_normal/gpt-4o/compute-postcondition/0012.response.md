According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Since there are no conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute again, no adjustments to the state are necessary.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
