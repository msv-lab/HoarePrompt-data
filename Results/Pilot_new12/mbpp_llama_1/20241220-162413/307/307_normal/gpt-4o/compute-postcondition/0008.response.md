To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

`triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2`

Given that `k` is 2, we substitute this value into the equation:

`triangular_number = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2`

`triangular_number = 2 * 3 // 2`

`triangular_number = 6 // 2`

`triangular_number = 3`

So, `triangular_number` is now 3. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and `k` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
