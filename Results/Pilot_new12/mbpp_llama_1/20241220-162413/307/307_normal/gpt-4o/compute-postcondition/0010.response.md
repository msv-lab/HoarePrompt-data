Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is equal to `n`, then the program returns 2. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the program continues with `n` being a positive integer, `k` being 2, `triangular_number` being 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` not being equal to `n`.**
