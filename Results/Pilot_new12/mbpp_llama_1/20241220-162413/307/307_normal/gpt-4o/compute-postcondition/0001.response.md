To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the program state right before the loop.

The `while` loop statement is `while True:`, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the program is running, because the condition `True` is always met.

Given the state right before the loop: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1.

Since the loop condition is `while True`, it does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` (or any other variables) to execute. The loop will execute at least once regardless of the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1**
