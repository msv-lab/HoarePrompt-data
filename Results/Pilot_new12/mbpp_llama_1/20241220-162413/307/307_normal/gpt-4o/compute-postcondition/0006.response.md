The code increments `k` by 1. The initial value of `k` is 1, so after the increment, `k` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
