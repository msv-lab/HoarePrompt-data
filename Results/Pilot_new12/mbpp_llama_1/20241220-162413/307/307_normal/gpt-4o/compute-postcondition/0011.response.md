The code increments `k` by 1. The previous value of `k` is 2. 

So, `k` becomes 2 + 1 = 3. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
