To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

The given code is: `triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Let's calculate the new value of `triangular_number`:

`triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2`
`triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2`
`triangular_number = 12 // 2`
`triangular_number = 6`

So, the value of `triangular_number` is updated to 6.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6, and the condition regarding the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` and `n` may have changed due to the update of `triangular_number`. The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is now 1 (since '6' is a single character), which is not equal to `n` because `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 (since the string length of the initial `triangular_number` which was 3, was not equal to `n`, and '3' also has a length of 1).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
