Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the length of the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) equals `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers starting from `k=1` until it finds a match, at which point it returns the corresponding `k`. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns a single integer value `k`, without any side effects. The actual return values are not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather depend on the input `n` and the properties of triangular numbers. The function will run indefinitely if no such `k` is found, but in practice, it will always terminate for any given positive integer `n` because the length of the string representation of triangular numbers increases without bound as `k` increases.**
