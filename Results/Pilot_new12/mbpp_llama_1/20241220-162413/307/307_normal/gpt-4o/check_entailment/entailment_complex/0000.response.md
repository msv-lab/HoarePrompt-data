Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits, but the program returns the smallest integer k for which the length of the string representation of the k-th triangular number equals n.

To illustrate this difference, consider the case where n = 2. The smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which is the 4th triangular number (1, 3, 6, 10). Therefore, the program should return 4, but instead it returns 4, which is the index of the 4th triangular number (not the 4th triangular number itself).

However, the 4th triangular number is indeed the smallest triangular number with 2 digits. In other cases, for example when n is 3, we can observe the 45 = 9 * 10 / 2 = 45 is the first triangular number with 2 digits and the function returns 4, but it should return 45 because 45 is the smallest triangular number with 2 digits. This case is still passed by the program. 

However the problem here is the program doesn't return what the user might expect in the description of the problem - it does return the index k to the first triangular number, not the triangular number itself when n is for example 3 or more.

Here is an example of a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return triangular_number
        
        k += 1
```
This corrected function will return the smallest triangular number with n digits, which is what the problem description asks for.
