You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function works by generating triangular numbers in ascending order and checking their length until it finds one with `n` digits.

The program appears to be correct because it:

1.  Generates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2.  Checks the length of the generated triangular number by converting it to a string and using the `len()` function.
3.  Returns the index `k` of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits as soon as it finds one.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs. For example, `func_1(2)` returns 4, which corresponds to the triangular number 10 (4th triangular number), `func_1(3)` returns 14, corresponding to the triangular number 105, and `func_1(4)` returns 45, corresponding to the triangular number 1035.

The function handles the case where `n` is a small integer (e.g., 1, 2) by correctly identifying the smallest triangular number with the specified number of digits.

There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the function's logic. The use of a `while` loop ensures that the function will continue generating triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` digits, and the `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` condition provides a clear stopping criterion.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all positive integer inputs `n`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the length of the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) equals `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers starting from `k=1` until it finds a match, at which point it returns the corresponding `k`. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns a single integer value `k`, without any side effects. The actual return values are not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather depend on the input `n` and the properties of triangular numbers. The function will run indefinitely if no such `k` is found, but in practice, it will always terminate for any given positive integer `n` because the length of the string representation of triangular numbers increases without bound as `k` increases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
