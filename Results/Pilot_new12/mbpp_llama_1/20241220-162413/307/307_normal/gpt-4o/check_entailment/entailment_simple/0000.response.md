Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function is supposed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `k` to 1. 
- It then enters a loop where it calculates the k-th triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- The program checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`. If it does, the function returns `k`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
- If the length of the string representation of the triangular number does not equal `n`, the program increments `k` by 1 and repeats the loop.
- This process continues until the program finds a triangular number with `n` digits, at which point it returns the corresponding `k` value.

The program assumes that the input is a positive integer, which is valid according to the problem description. Therefore, it does not include any error checking to handle invalid inputs.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the program, as they verify that the function returns the expected results for different inputs. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement and returns the correct index for the smallest triangular number with n digits.
