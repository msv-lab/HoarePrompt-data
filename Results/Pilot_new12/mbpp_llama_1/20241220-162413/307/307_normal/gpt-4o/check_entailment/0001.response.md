Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function uses a simple iterative approach, starting from `k = 1` and incrementing `k` until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits.

Here's why the code is correct:

- The formula for the `k`-th triangular number is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, which is correctly implemented in the code.
- The function checks the number of digits in the current triangular number by converting it to a string and checking its length (`len(str(triangular_number)) == n`). This approach is correct because it directly counts the digits in the number.
- Once the function finds a triangular number with `n` digits, it returns the current value of `k`, which represents the index of that triangular number.
- The function uses a `while True` loop, ensuring that it will continue iterating until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.
