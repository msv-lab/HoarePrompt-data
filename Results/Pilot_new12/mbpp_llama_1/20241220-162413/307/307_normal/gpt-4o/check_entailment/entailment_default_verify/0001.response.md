The original assessment of the program's correctness makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function correctly implements the formula for the k-th triangular number and iterates through triangular numbers until it finds one with n digits.

The output hints provided also support the correctness of the program. They accurately describe the function's behavior, including its input, output, and iteration process. The hints also note that the function will run indefinitely if no such k is found, but this is not a concern in practice because the length of the string representation of triangular numbers increases without bound as k increases.

Based on the program, the output hints, the problem description, and the original assessment, I conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality and does not contain any errors.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly evaluates the program's logic, iteration process, and input/output behavior. The assessment also considers the unit tests provided, which suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment and conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
