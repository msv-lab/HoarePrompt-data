Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the length of the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number equals `n`. The function uses a loop to iterate through triangular numbers starting from `k=1` until it finds a match, at which point it returns the corresponding `k`.

The code handles the general case where `n` can be any positive integer, and it will always terminate for any given input because the length of the string representation of triangular numbers increases without bound as `k` increases.

The provided unit tests (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) demonstrate that the function works correctly for different values of `n`.

The code does not have any visible errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It assumes that the input will be a valid positive integer, and it does not attempt to handle any invalid inputs, which is allowed according to the problem description. 

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional insight into the function's behavior, including its ability to handle inputs beyond the provided unit tests. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
