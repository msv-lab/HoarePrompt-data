You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function uses a simple iterative approach, starting from `k = 1` and incrementing `k` until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits.

Here's why the code is correct:

- The formula for the `k`-th triangular number is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, which is correctly implemented in the code.
- The function checks the number of digits in the current triangular number by converting it to a string and checking its length (`len(str(triangular_number)) == n`). This approach is correct because it directly counts the digits in the number.
- Once the function finds a triangular number with `n` digits, it returns the current value of `k`, which represents the index of that triangular number.
- The function uses a `while True` loop, ensuring that it will continue iterating until it finds a triangular number with `n` digits.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the length of the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) equals `n`. The function iterates through triangular numbers starting from `k=1` until it finds a match, at which point it returns the corresponding `k`. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns a single integer value `k`, without any side effects. The actual return values are not limited to 1, 2, or 3 as suggested by the annotations, but rather depend on the input `n` and the properties of triangular numbers. The function will run indefinitely if no such `k` is found, but in practice, it will always terminate for any given positive integer `n` because the length of the string representation of triangular numbers increases without bound as `k` increases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
