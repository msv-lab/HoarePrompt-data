Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function works by generating triangular numbers in ascending order and checking their length until it finds one with `n` digits.

The program appears to be correct because it:

1.  Generates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2.  Checks the length of the generated triangular number by converting it to a string and using the `len()` function.
3.  Returns the index `k` of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits as soon as it finds one.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs. For example, `func_1(2)` returns 4, which corresponds to the triangular number 10 (4th triangular number), `func_1(3)` returns 14, corresponding to the triangular number 105, and `func_1(4)` returns 45, corresponding to the triangular number 1035.

The function handles the case where `n` is a small integer (e.g., 1, 2) by correctly identifying the smallest triangular number with the specified number of digits.

There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the function's logic. The use of a `while` loop ensures that the function will continue generating triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` digits, and the `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` condition provides a clear stopping criterion.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all positive integer inputs `n`.
