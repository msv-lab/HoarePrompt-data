Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code correctly implements a function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

The formula for the `k`-th triangular number is correctly implemented as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and the function checks the number of digits in the current triangular number by converting it to a string and checking its length. This approach is correct because it directly counts the digits in the number.

The annotated version of the code also supports the correctness of the original assessment. The state of the program before the function call is as expected, where `n` is a positive integer. The state of the program after the loop has been executed also matches the expected behavior, where the function returns the smallest `k` for which the length of the string representation of `k * (k + 1) // 2` equals the original value of `n`.

The unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for different inputs. Given the provided information and the assumption that the input will always be a valid positive integer, the program appears to be correct.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the refined assessment remains the same.

Final: **True**
