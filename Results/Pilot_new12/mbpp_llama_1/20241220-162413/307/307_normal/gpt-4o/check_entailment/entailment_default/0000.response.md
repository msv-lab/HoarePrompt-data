Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through triangular numbers starting from `k=1` until it finds a match, at which point it returns the corresponding `k`. The function returns the smallest integer `k` for which the length of the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) equals `n`.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, and `assert func_1(4) == 45` all pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected for these cases. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and help confirm that the function works correctly.

The function does not have any obvious edge cases that are not handled correctly, and it assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description. Therefore, the code appears to be correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
