The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest positive integer `idx` such that the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length of at least `n`. The function does not modify the original value of `n` and will continue to increment `idx` until the length condition is met, at which point it will return the corresponding `idx` value. The return value is not limited to 1, 2, or 3, but rather any positive integer that satisfies the length condition for the given `n`. The function will always terminate with a return value, as the loop will continue indefinitely until the condition is met.
