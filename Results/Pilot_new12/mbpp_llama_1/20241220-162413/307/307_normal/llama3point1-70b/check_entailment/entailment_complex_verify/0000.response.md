The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and after reviewing the annotated version of the code, this assessment remains accurate.

The annotated version of the code confirms the original assessment's description of how the function operates. It starts with `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length of at least `n`, at which point it returns `idx`. The annotations also clarify that the function does not modify the original value of `n` and will continue to increment `idx` until the length condition is met.

The annotated version does not introduce any new information that would suggest the original assessment was incorrect. Instead, it reinforces the understanding that the function is designed to find the smallest index `idx` such that the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a string representation of length at least `n`, and that it does so by incrementing `idx` until this condition is met.

The key points from the annotated version that support the original assessment include:
- The function starts with `idx = 1` and increments `idx` in each iteration.
- The loop continues until the string representation of the triangular number has a length greater than or equal to `n`.
- The function returns the smallest `idx` that satisfies this length condition.

Given that the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and the problem description, there is no reason to change the assessment. The function correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
