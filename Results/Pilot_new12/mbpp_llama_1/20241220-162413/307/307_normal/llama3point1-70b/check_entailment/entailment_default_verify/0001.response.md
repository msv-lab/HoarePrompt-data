The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly implements a function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits, using a while loop that increments `idx` until the condition is met. The formula for calculating the `idx`th triangular number is correct, and the condition checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number, which aligns with the problem description.

The output hints provided further support the correctness of the program, as they accurately describe the function's behavior and do not reveal any discrepancies between the code's functionality and the problem description. The hints confirm that the function accepts a positive integer `n`, returns the smallest positive integer `idx` satisfying the length condition, and does not modify the original value of `n`. They also clarify that the return value is not limited to specific integers and that the function will always terminate with a return value, which is consistent with the code's implementation.

Given the alignment between the problem description, the code, and the output hints, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same.

Final: **True**
