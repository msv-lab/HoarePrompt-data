You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest value such that the string representation of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, and the loop terminates with this `idx` value. The original value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest positive integer `idx` such that the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length of at least `n`. The function does not modify the original value of `n` and will continue to increment `idx` until the length condition is met, at which point it will return the corresponding `idx` value. The return value is not limited to 1, 2, or 3, but rather any positive integer that satisfies the length condition for the given `n`. The function will always terminate with a return value, as the loop will continue indefinitely until the condition is met.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
