Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's why the code works as expected:
- It starts with an index `idx` of 1 and calculates the corresponding triangular number using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current index `idx`.
- If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the process until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- This process is guaranteed to terminate because as `idx` increases, the number of digits in the corresponding triangular number also increases, ensuring that the condition will eventually be met for any positive `n`.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function will indeed return the smallest `idx` such that the triangular number has at least `n` digits. Given that we assume the input `n` is a valid positive integer, the function handles all potential cases correctly without any restrictions on `n`'s value. 

Thus, based on the provided code and output hints, the function correctly implements the logic for finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits for every potential case.
