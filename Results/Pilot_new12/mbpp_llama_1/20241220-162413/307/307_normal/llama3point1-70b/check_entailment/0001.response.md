Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` seems to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's why it's correct:
- The function uses a while loop that starts from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until it finds the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the `idx`th triangular number, which is correct.
- The condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` checks if the calculated triangular number has at least `n` digits. If it does, the function returns `idx`.
- The function handles all potential cases because the while loop will run indefinitely until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so the program is considered correct. It correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input.
