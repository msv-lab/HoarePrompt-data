Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
- It starts by setting `idx` to 1, which represents the index of the triangular number sequence.
- It then enters an infinite loop where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- If the calculated triangular number has `n` or more digits (determined by `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`), the function returns `idx`.
- If not, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.

The function will keep calculating triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` or more digits and returns its index. This aligns with the problem description.

Since the loop will always terminate when a triangular number with `n` or more digits is found (as the sequence of triangular numbers is increasing and will eventually exceed any given number of digits), and the function correctly identifies the index of the smallest such triangular number, the code is correct for all positive integer inputs of `n`.

The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but based on the problem description, `n` is assumed to represent the number of digits, which should be a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected, but this is outside the scope of the given problem description. 

However, given the constraints typically associated with such problems (i.e., `n` being a positive integer), the function should operate correctly for all applicable inputs.
