Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits, where n is a positive integer.

Here's why the program is correct:

- It starts by initializing `idx` to 1, which is the smallest possible index for a triangular number.
- It then enters an infinite loop, where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the string representation of the calculated triangular number has a length greater than or equal to `n`. If it does, it returns `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- If the length of the string representation is less than `n`, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.
- Since `idx` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the program is guaranteed to find the smallest index `idx` such that the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length greater than or equal to `n`.

The program assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer, which is a valid assumption according to the problem statement. It does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but this is not required according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description asks for, assuming that the input is a positive integer.
