Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the smallest positive integer `idx` such that the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has at least `n` digits.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function uses a `while` loop to increment the `idx` variable until the length condition is met.
2. The triangular number is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which is correct.
3. The length of the triangular number is checked using `len(str(triangular_num))`, which correctly converts the number to a string and returns its length.
4. The function returns the `idx` value as soon as the length condition is met, which is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to worry about edge cases such as negative or zero inputs. The program will always terminate with a return value, as the loop will continue indefinitely until the condition is met.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
