Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program meets the problem description:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input, which represents the number of digits in the triangular number.

2. The function uses a `while` loop to generate triangular numbers by calculating `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, where `idx` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. Inside the loop, the function checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. This is done using the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`.

4. If the condition is met, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.

5. The loop continues indefinitely until the condition is met, ensuring that the function always returns the smallest index that satisfies the condition.

The program correctly implements the problem description because it:

* Takes a positive integer `n` as input
* Generates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`
* Checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number
* Returns the smallest index `idx` such that the length of the triangular number is at least `n`

Since the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
