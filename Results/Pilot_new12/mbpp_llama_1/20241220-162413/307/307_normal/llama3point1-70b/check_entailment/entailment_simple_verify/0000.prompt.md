You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
- It starts by setting `idx` to 1, which represents the index of the triangular number sequence.
- It then enters an infinite loop where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- If the calculated triangular number has `n` or more digits (determined by `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`), the function returns `idx`.
- If not, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.

The function will keep calculating triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` or more digits and returns its index. This aligns with the problem description.

Since the loop will always terminate when a triangular number with `n` or more digits is found (as the sequence of triangular numbers is increasing and will eventually exceed any given number of digits), and the function correctly identifies the index of the smallest such triangular number, the code is correct for all positive integer inputs of `n`.

The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but based on the problem description, `n` is assumed to represent the number of digits, which should be a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected, but this is outside the scope of the given problem description. 

However, given the constraints typically associated with such problems (i.e., `n` being a positive integer), the function should operate correctly for all applicable inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest value such that the string representation of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, and the loop terminates with this `idx` value. The original value of `n` remains unchanged.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
