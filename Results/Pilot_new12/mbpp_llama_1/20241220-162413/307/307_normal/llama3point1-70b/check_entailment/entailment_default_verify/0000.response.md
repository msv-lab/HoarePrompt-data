Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the original assessment, the code appears to be correct. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It uses a while loop to calculate the `idx`-th triangular number until it finds one with `n` or more digits, at which point it returns `idx`. The original assessment notes that the function will always terminate when a triangular number with `n` or more digits is found, as the sequence of triangular numbers is increasing and will eventually exceed any given number of digits.

The output hints also support the correctness of the function. They summarize the code's functionality, stating that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest positive integer `idx` such that the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length of at least `n`. This aligns with the problem description and the provided code.

I agree with the original assessment because it accurately describes the function's behavior and provides a clear explanation of why the function is correct. The assessment notes that the function will keep calculating triangular numbers until it finds one with `n` or more digits and returns its index, which is precisely what the function is designed to do. Additionally, the assessment acknowledges that the function may not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, but this is outside the scope of the given problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function is correct for all positive integer inputs of `n`, and it will always terminate with a return value.

Final: **True**
