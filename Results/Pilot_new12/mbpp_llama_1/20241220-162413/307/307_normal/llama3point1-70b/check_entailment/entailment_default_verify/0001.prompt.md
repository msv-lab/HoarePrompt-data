You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` seems to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's why it's correct:
- The function uses a while loop that starts from `idx = 1` and increments `idx` until it finds the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.
- The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the `idx`th triangular number, which is correct.
- The condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` checks if the calculated triangular number has at least `n` digits. If it does, the function returns `idx`.
- The function handles all potential cases because the while loop will run indefinitely until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so the program is considered correct. It correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest positive integer `idx` such that the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length of at least `n`. The function does not modify the original value of `n` and will continue to increment `idx` until the length condition is met, at which point it will return the corresponding `idx` value. The return value is not limited to 1, 2, or 3, but rather any positive integer that satisfies the length condition for the given `n`. The function will always terminate with a return value, as the loop will continue indefinitely until the condition is met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
