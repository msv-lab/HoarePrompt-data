Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program appears to be correct.

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program that ensure its correctness:

- The formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the `idx`th triangular number, which is correct.
- The condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` checks if the calculated triangular number has at least `n` digits. If it does, the function returns `idx`.
- The function handles all potential cases because the while loop will run indefinitely until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior and supports the original assessment. Specifically:

- The state of the program before the function call indicates that `n` is a positive integer, which is a valid assumption as per the problem description.
- The state of the program after the loop has been executed indicates that `idx` is the smallest value such that the string representation of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` has a length greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, and the loop terminates with this `idx` value.

There is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly implements the formula for calculating triangular numbers, and the while loop ensures that it finds the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.

The only potential issue with the program is that it returns the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits, rather than exactly `n` digits. However, this is a minor quibble, and the program is still correct in the sense that it meets the problem description.

Therefore, based on the available information, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
