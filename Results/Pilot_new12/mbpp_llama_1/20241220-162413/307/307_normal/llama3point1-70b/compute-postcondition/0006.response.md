The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer, `triangular_num` is still 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is still less than `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
