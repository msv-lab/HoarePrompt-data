Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, no change occurs, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` remains less than `n`.***
