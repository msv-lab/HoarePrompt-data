To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't have information about what happens inside the loop, but we know that the loop will execute again because of the `while True` condition.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `idx` is 2
- `triangular_num` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`

For a `while True` loop, regardless of the current state of the variables, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
