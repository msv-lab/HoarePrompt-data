According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, no adjustments to the states are needed for the loop to execute one more time. The states at the end of the previous iteration are sufficient for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
