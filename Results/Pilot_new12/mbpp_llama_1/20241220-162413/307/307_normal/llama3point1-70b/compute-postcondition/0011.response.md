The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 2, so the new value of `idx` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, no change occurs, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` remains less than `n`.
