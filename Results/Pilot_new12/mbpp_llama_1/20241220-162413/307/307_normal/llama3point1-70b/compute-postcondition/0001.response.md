To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement: `while True`. This type of loop will continue to execute indefinitely because its condition is always true. There are no specific conditions related to the variables `n` and `idx` that need to be met for the loop to execute; the loop will run regardless of their values.

Given this, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time, as the loop condition `while True` does not depend on any variable states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 1**
