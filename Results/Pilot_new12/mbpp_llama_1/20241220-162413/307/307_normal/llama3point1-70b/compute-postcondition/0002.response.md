The code calculates the value of `triangular_num` based on the current value of `idx`. Since `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is assigned the value of `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which is `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**
