To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3.

The code provided is: `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.

Given that `idx` is 3, we substitute this value into the formula:

`triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2`

`triangular_num = 3 * 4 // 2`

`triangular_num = 12 // 2`

`triangular_num = 6`

So, the value of `triangular_num` changes to 6. The values of `n` and `idx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
