The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` is 3, so the new value of `idx` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 4, `triangular_num` is 6. If the number of digits in `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns `idx` which is 4. Otherwise, there is no return value.
