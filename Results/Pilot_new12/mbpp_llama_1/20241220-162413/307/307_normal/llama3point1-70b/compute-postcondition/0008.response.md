To determine the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the given Python code.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Given Code: `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`

Since `idx` is 2, we can substitute it into the equation:
`triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2`
`triangular_num = 2 * 3 // 2`
`triangular_num = 6 // 2`
`triangular_num = 3`

Now, let's evaluate the output state:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
- `idx` remains unchanged with a value of 2.
- `triangular_num` is updated to 3.
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is now the length of the string "3", which is 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, the condition that the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n` is still valid for any `n` greater than 1.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
