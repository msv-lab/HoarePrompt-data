You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, rather than 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Base cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Recursive case**: For `n > 1`, the function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to the first two numbers in the sequence (2 and 1), and then iteratively updates these variables to hold the next two numbers in the sequence. This process continues until `n` iterations have been completed, at which point `b` holds the n'th Lucas number.

3. **No obvious edge cases**: The function handles all non-negative integer values of `n` correctly. For negative integers or non-integer values, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, but they are not part of the standard definition of the Lucas sequence either.

4. **No divide-by-zero errors or other potential issues**: The function does not involve division or other operations that could potentially lead to errors for valid inputs.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases and does not contain any obvious errors, we can conclude that it is correct for calculating the n'th Lucas number.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1. It handles three main cases: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the base cases of `n` being 0 or 1, and the recursive case for `n` greater than 1, ensuring that the returned value corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number in the specified sequence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
