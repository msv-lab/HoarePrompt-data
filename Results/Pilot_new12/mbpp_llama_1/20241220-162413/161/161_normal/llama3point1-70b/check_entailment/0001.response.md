Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, rather than 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Base cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Recursive case**: For `n > 1`, the function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to the first two numbers in the sequence (2 and 1), and then iteratively updates these variables to hold the next two numbers in the sequence. This process continues until `n` iterations have been completed, at which point `b` holds the n'th Lucas number.

3. **No obvious edge cases**: The function handles all non-negative integer values of `n` correctly. For negative integers or non-integer values, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, but they are not part of the standard definition of the Lucas sequence either.

4. **No divide-by-zero errors or other potential issues**: The function does not involve division or other operations that could potentially lead to errors for valid inputs.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases and does not contain any obvious errors, we can conclude that it is correct for calculating the n'th Lucas number.
