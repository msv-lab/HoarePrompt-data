The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. 

The annotated version of the code describes the states at different parts of the program. The key part of the annotated code is the comment after the for loop: 
`#State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.`

This comment accurately describes the state of the program after the for loop. However, the problem description asks for the n'th Lucas number, not the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. Although the Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, the comment in the annotated code refers to the Fibonacci sequence, which might be misleading.

Despite this potential source of confusion, the code itself and the original assessment are correct. The Lucas sequence is defined as a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, rather than 0 and 1. The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this definition.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number.

Final: **True**
