## Analysis of the Program

The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Program

1. The function `func_1(n)` checks if `n` is 0, in which case it returns 2.
2. If `n` is 1, it returns 1.
3. For `n` greater than 1, it initializes `a` to 2 and `b` to 1 and then iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the `(n-1)`th and `n`th numbers in the sequence, respectively.
4. Finally, it returns `b`, which is the `n`th number in the sequence.

## Comparison with the Problem Description

The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The provided program correctly implements this sequence.

## Correctness Evaluation

Given that the problem description asks for the n'th Lucas number and the program implements the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1 (which is the definition of the Lucas sequence), we can conclude that the program does what the problem description asks for.

## Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number as defined by the Lucas sequence, which starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The final answer is: **True**
