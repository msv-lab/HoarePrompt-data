You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.

The program correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For n greater than 1, it uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number by iteratively updating the variables a and b to hold the last two numbers in the sequence. The loop runs from 2 to n, and after the loop finishes, b holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

This program works correctly for all non-negative integers n. It handles edge cases such as n = 0 and n = 1 correctly, and it correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number for larger values of n. It does not have any obvious flaws or potential cases where it would not work as expected. 

The time complexity of this program is O(n), which is optimal for this problem since we need to calculate each Lucas number up to the nth number. The space complexity is O(1), which is also optimal since we are only using a constant amount of space to store the last two numbers in the sequence. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided source code, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1. It handles three main cases: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the base cases of `n` being 0 or 1, and the recursive case for `n` greater than 1, ensuring that the returned value corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number in the specified sequence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
