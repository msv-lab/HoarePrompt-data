Correctness: **True**

The given program is a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.

The program correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For n greater than 1, it uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number by iteratively updating the variables a and b to hold the last two numbers in the sequence. The loop runs from 2 to n, and after the loop finishes, b holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

This program works correctly for all non-negative integers n. It handles edge cases such as n = 0 and n = 1 correctly, and it correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number for larger values of n. It does not have any obvious flaws or potential cases where it would not work as expected. 

The time complexity of this program is O(n), which is optimal for this problem since we need to calculate each Lucas number up to the nth number. The space complexity is O(1), which is also optimal since we are only using a constant amount of space to store the last two numbers in the sequence. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided source code, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
