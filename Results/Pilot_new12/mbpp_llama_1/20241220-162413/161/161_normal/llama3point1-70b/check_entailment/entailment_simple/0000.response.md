Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number. 

In the context of the Lucas sequence, which starts with 2 and 1, and where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two, the given function will return the correct n'th number.

The base cases for the function are when `n` equals 0 or 1, where it correctly returns 2 and 1, respectively, as these are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence. 

For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to calculate the n'th number in the sequence. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the sequence. It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b` in each iteration, effectively calculating the next number in the sequence. 

After the loop completes, `b` holds the n'th number in the Lucas sequence, which the function returns. This meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, so the program is correct. 

Therefore, the program will return the n'th Lucas number for any non-negative integer `n`.
