Correctness: **False**

The code is supposed to calculate the n'th Lucas number, but it is actually calculating a number in a Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1. The Lucas sequence is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1. However, the recurrence relation remains the same: each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The issue here is that the code does correctly calculate a Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, but the Lucas sequence actually starts with 2 and 1, yet the convention for the Lucas sequence typically sets the starting points as 2 (L(0)) and 1 (L(1)), but the sequence progresses as follows: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, etc.

However, a standard Lucas sequence is defined with the recurrence relation, but with initial values L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1. The provided code implements this sequence correctly based on its own definition (starting with 2 and 1 and then applying the Fibonacci-like recurrence), so in the context of its specific definition, the code is correct.

Yet, the traditional Lucas sequence starts with 2, 1, and proceeds with the sum of the prior two numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, etc.), so technically the problem description and the code match if we're considering the provided sequence definition as the basis, not the conventional definition of Lucas numbers which typically could start with 2 and 1, but are often indexed differently or have specific properties not directly mentioned in the problem description.

Given the specific definition in the problem and assuming a generalized understanding of the task where the sequence starts with 2 and 1 and follows a Fibonacci-like progression, the code is actually correct in its implementation for this specific sequence. The potential confusion arises from the nomenclature and conventional expectation around Lucas numbers.

Reevaluating the strict definitions and common understanding of sequences, and acknowledging the direct implementation provided:

Correctness should be reconsidered based on the specific problem description and implementation details provided, focusing on whether the code accurately implements the described sequence, which it does. 

Correctness: **True** 

This is because, given the definition provided in the problem (a sequence starting with 2 and 1, and progressing as a Fibonacci sequence), the code correctly implements this definition for every potential case as described. The initial assessment incorrectly introduced a distinction based on conventional definitions of Lucas numbers, but in the context of the problem as stated, the code is a correct implementation of the specified sequence.
