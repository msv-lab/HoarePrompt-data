To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints provided.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones, similar to the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the program is correct (**True**), explaining that it properly handles the base cases (n = 0 and n = 1) and calculates the n'th Lucas number for n > 1 with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1).

3. **Output Hints**: The hints describe the function's behavior as taking a non-negative integer n and returning the nth number in a sequence that starts with 2 and 1, handling cases for n = 0, n = 1, and n > 1 correctly. However, the hints incorrectly refer to the sequence as the "Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1" instead of the Lucas sequence.

Given the information above, let's evaluate the program's correctness:

- The program correctly implements the Lucas sequence, starting with 2 and 1, and calculates the n'th number in this sequence.
- The original assessment accurately describes the program's functionality and its complexities.
- The output hints essentially summarize the program's behavior correctly but misuse the term "Fibonacci sequence" when they should refer to the "Lucas sequence." This mistake, however, does not affect the program's correctness but rather the accuracy of the hints themselves.

Since the program accurately calculates the n'th Lucas number as per the problem description and the original assessment correctly evaluates the program's functionality, the final assessment of the program's correctness should align with the original assessment.

Final: **True**
