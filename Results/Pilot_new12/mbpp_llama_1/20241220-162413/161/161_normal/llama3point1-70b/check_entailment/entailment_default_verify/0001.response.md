Based on the provided information, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number, and the provided code implements this functionality correctly. The code handles the base cases when n is 0 or 1, and it uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number for n greater than 1.

The output hints also support the correctness of the program, as they describe the function's behavior accurately. The hints mention that the function takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is equivalent to the Lucas sequence.

One potential point of confusion is that the output hints refer to the sequence as the "Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1", whereas the problem description and the original assessment refer to it as the "Lucas sequence". However, this is simply a matter of terminology, as the sequence in question is indeed the Lucas sequence, which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a different starting point.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
