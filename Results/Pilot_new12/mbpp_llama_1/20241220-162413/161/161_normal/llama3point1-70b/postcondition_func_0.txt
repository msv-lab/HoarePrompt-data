The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1. It handles three main cases: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the base cases of `n` being 0 or 1, and the recursive case for `n` greater than 1, ensuring that the returned value corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number in the specified sequence.
