According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the current iteration number is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts from 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is 3, and `b` is 4. Since the loop counter is not explicitly mentioned, we can assume it to be the variable that takes the values from 2 to `n` (inclusive) in each iteration. Let's call this variable `loop_counter`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `loop_counter` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to have executed. Given that `n` is greater than 4, and the loop starts from 2, `loop_counter` could have been 2, 3, or 4 in the previous iteration when `n` was at least 4. However, since we're considering the state at the end of the previous iteration and `n` is greater than 4, we can infer that the previous iteration must have completed, meaning `loop_counter` would have been at least 4 if `n` was exactly 4, but since `n` is greater than 4, `loop_counter` could be 4 and the loop would still execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `loop_counter` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5 (since it was at least 4 at the end of the last iteration and we're considering the scenario where `n` is greater than 4), and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `loop_counter`, which is 5.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 5, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
