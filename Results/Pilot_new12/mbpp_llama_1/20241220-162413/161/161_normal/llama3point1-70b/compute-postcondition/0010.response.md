The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then updates `b` with the sum of the original `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. 

After execution, `a` becomes the original value of `b`, which is 3, and `b` becomes the sum of the original `a` and `b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

The state of `n` is not affected by the code, so `n` remains a positive integer greater than 4.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
