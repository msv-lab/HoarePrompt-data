To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that:
- `a` and `b` are updated in each iteration.
- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 2.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than or equal to 2), `a` will remain 2 and `b` will remain 1.

Let's analyze the loop code:
- In each iteration, `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`.
- This is a Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` are 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (with a shift, as the traditional sequence starts with 0 and 1).
- After the loop finishes, `a` and `b` will hold the `(n-1)`th and `n`th numbers in this shifted Fibonacci sequence, respectively.

Now, let's determine the output state:
- If `n` is 2 or less, the loop will not execute, so `a` will remain 2 and `b` will remain 1.
- If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will execute, and `a` and `b` will hold the `(n-1)`th and `n`th numbers in the shifted Fibonacci sequence, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.**
