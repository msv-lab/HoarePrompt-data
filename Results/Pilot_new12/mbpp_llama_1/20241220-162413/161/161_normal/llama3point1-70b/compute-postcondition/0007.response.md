According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is 2, and `b` is 1. Since the loop will start from 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once (if `n` equals 2, the loop will still execute once). 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
