According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3. The loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state. 

For the loop to execute again, the current iteration must be less than `n`. Since the loop starts from 2, the next iteration would be 3, and then 4, and so on, until it reaches `n`. 

At the start of the next iteration, the loop variable `_` would be 4 (because the previous iteration was 3), and `n` must still be greater than the current iteration. Since the loop variable starts from 2, the next value would be the current value plus 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time after the current iteration (which is 3), the next iteration would be 4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4, but `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
