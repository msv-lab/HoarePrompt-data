To determine the output state, let's first understand the initial state and the Python code snippet provided.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.
- `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.

The Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1 would be: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76,...

The code simply returns `b`, which is the nth number in this sequence.

Output State: **The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.**
