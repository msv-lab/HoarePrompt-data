To calculate the output state, we first examine the initial state and the given code. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1. The code provided is `a, b = b, a + b`. 

Given this, we can calculate the new values of `a` and `b` as follows:
- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 1.
- The new value of `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3.

So, after executing the code, `a` is 1, and `b` is 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
