The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns specific values based on the following cases: 
Case_1: The program returns 2. 
Case_2: The program returns 1. 
Case_3: The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a value based on the given conditions, which include returning 2, 1, or the nth Fibonacci number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns either 2, 1, or the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.**
