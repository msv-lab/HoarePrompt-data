#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1. It handles three main cases: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. The function correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the base cases of `n` being 0 or 1, and the recursive case for `n` greater than 1, ensuring that the returned value corresponds to the nth Fibonacci number in the specified sequence.
