Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the Lucas sequence, which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The program correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and for n greater than 1, it calculates the nth Lucas number using a loop.

The key insight here is that the Lucas sequence can be generated using the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci sequence, but with different initial values. The program takes advantage of this by initializing `a` and `b` to 2 and 1, respectively, and then iteratively updating them to calculate the next number in the sequence.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly returns the nth Lucas number for any given non-negative integer n. The assertions provided also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate that the program produces the correct results for specific values of n.

It's worth noting that the program assumes that the input n is a non-negative integer, as stated in the problem description. Under this assumption, the program is correct and will always produce the expected results.
