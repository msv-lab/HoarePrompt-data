You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be a function that calculates the n'th Lucas number, which is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point. The program starts with the base cases of `func_1(0) = 2` and `func_1(1) = 1`, and then iteratively calculates the next Lucas numbers up to the n'th number.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7` and `assert func_1(3) == 4` also validate the correctness of the program.

After analyzing the code and checking against the problem description, I was unable to find any potential case that the program does not handle correctly. The iterative approach used to calculate the Lucas numbers is correct and should work for all non-negative integer inputs.

The program correctly handles the base cases and iteratively applies the Lucas number recurrence relation `Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2` to calculate the next numbers in the sequence. The use of a simple loop to iterate from 2 to n makes the program efficient and avoids unnecessary complexities.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that the program is correct and should produce the expected results for all non-negative integer inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. Specifically, it returns `2` if `n` equals 0, `1` if `n` equals 1, and the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence if `n` is greater than 1. The function handles all non-negative integers, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1, effectively providing the nth number in the modified Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
