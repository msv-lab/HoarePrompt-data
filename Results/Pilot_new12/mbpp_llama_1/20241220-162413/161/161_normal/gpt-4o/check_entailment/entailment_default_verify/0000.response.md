Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The provided code implements a function that calculates the n'th number in a sequence that starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a different starting point.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling non-negative integers, including edge cases where n is 0 or 1, and correctly calculating the nth number in the modified Fibonacci sequence.

Although the sequence is referred to as the Lucas sequence, it is indeed the sequence of numbers that starts with 2 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The Lucas sequence is typically defined as starting with 2 and 1, and the provided code correctly implements this sequence.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles all non-negative integer inputs and applies the recurrence relation Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2 to calculate the next numbers in the sequence. The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
