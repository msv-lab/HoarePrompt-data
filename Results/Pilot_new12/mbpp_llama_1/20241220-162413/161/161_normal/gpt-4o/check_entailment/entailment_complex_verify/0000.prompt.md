You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be a function that calculates the n'th Lucas number, which is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point. The program starts with the base cases of `func_1(0) = 2` and `func_1(1) = 1`, and then iteratively calculates the next Lucas numbers up to the n'th number.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7` and `assert func_1(3) == 4` also validate the correctness of the program.

After analyzing the code and checking against the problem description, I was unable to find any potential case that the program does not handle correctly. The iterative approach used to calculate the Lucas numbers is correct and should work for all non-negative integer inputs.

The program correctly handles the base cases and iteratively applies the Lucas number recurrence relation `Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2` to calculate the next numbers in the sequence. The use of a simple loop to iterate from 2 to n makes the program efficient and avoids unnecessary complexities.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that the program is correct and should produce the expected results for all non-negative integer inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)th number and `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. Specifically, it returns `2` if `n` equals 0, `1` if `n` equals 1, and the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence if `n` is greater than 1. The function handles all non-negative integers, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1, effectively providing the nth number in the modified Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
