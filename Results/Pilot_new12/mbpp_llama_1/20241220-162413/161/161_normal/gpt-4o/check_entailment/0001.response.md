Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the first two numbers being 2 and 1, and each subsequent number being the sum of the previous two.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. **Base cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, returning 2 and 1, respectively.

2. **Recurrence relation**: The function correctly implements the recurrence relation for the Lucas sequence, which is `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)`.

3. **Loop**: The function uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The loop starts from `n = 2` and iterates up to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` at each step.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function for different values of `n` (4, 3, and 9) and verify that it returns the correct results.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program might not work as expected. The code seems to correctly implement the Lucas sequence formula and handles different inputs correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
