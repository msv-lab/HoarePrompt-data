Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The problem description states that the function should find the n'th Lucas number. However, the code provided calculates the n'th number in a Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, which is not the definition of the Lucas sequence. The Lucas sequence is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The correct sequence is: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76,... 

The function provided does match this sequence, but it is incorrectly described as calculating the Fibonacci sequence. The provided unit tests do match the Lucas sequence, so it seems that the code is actually intended to calculate the Lucas sequence, but the output hints and code comments are incorrect. 

Since the code does indeed calculate the Lucas sequence for the given unit tests, it would be correct if the problem description and output hints were updated to reflect that it is calculating the Lucas sequence, not the Fibonacci sequence. However, as the problem description currently stands, the code does not match the description, so the correctness is **False**.
