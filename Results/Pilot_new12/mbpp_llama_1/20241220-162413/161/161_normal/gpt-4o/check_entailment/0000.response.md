Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be a function that calculates the n'th Lucas number, which is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point. The program starts with the base cases of `func_1(0) = 2` and `func_1(1) = 1`, and then iteratively calculates the next Lucas numbers up to the n'th number.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7` and `assert func_1(3) == 4` also validate the correctness of the program.

After analyzing the code and checking against the problem description, I was unable to find any potential case that the program does not handle correctly. The iterative approach used to calculate the Lucas numbers is correct and should work for all non-negative integer inputs.

The program correctly handles the base cases and iteratively applies the Lucas number recurrence relation `Ln = Ln-1 + Ln-2` to calculate the next numbers in the sequence. The use of a simple loop to iterate from 2 to n makes the program efficient and avoids unnecessary complexities.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that the program is correct and should produce the expected results for all non-negative integer inputs.
