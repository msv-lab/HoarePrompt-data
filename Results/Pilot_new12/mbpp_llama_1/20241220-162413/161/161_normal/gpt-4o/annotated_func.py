#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)th number and `b` is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. Specifically, it returns `2` if `n` equals 0, `1` if `n` equals 1, and the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence if `n` is greater than 1. The function handles all non-negative integers, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1, effectively providing the nth number in the modified Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
