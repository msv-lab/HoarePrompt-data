According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over a range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `a` is 3, and `b` is 4. Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the state description, we'll focus on the condition that allows the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration must have just finished with the value of `_` being the second-to-last value in the range, which means `n` must be at least one more than the last value that `_` took. Since the loop starts from 2, the values of `_` would be 2, 3, and so on up to `n`.

Given that the last iteration occurred with `a` being 3 and `b` being 4, and considering the loop's range starts from 2, if `n` is at least 3 and we've just finished an iteration, the next iteration can occur if `n` is at least 4 (since the loop would have iterated over 2 and 3, and is ready to iterate over 4).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the last value that `_` took, which implies `n` must be at least 4 for the next iteration to start. The values of `a` and `b` don't directly affect the loop's iteration condition but are part of the program state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
