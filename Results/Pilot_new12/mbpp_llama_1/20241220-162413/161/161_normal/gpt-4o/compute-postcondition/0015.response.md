The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the return value depends on the value of `n`. 

Case_1, Case_2, and Case_3 are return points of the function. 
Looking into the given return values we see that 
Case_1 returns `2`, 
Case_2 returns `1`, and 
Case_3 returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Now diving deeper into the value of n for each Case:
- For Case_1 to be fullfilled n should be equal to 0.
- For Case_2 to be fullfilled n should be equal to 1.
- For Case_3 to be fullfilled n should be a positive integer greater than 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the nth number in a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence where the first two numbers are 2 and 1 if n is greater than 1, `2` if `n` equals 0 and `1` if `n` equals 1.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, returns `2` if n equals 0, `1` if n equals 1, and the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1 if n is greater than 1.**
