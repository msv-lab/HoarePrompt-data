To determine the output state, we first need to understand the Fibonacci sequence and how `a` and `b` are defined within this sequence, given that it starts with 2 and 1.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Starting with 2 and 1, the sequence would be: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, and so on.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, and that `a` is the `(n-1)`th number and `b` is the `n`th number in this sequence, we need to consider what `b` represents.

Since `b` is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1, and given that `n` is not equal to 1, `b` will be a number in the sequence that follows the initial terms.

For example, if `n` = 2, then `b` would be the 2nd number in the sequence, which is 1. If `n` = 3, then `b` would be the 3rd number, which is 3. For `n` = 4, `b` would be 4, and so on.

Thus, `b` is returned as the `n`th number in a Fibonacci sequence where the first two numbers are 2 and 1, and `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1.

Output State: **The program returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.**
