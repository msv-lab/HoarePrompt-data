The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After the update, `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 3, and `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

The value of `n` is not affected by this code, so it remains a positive integer and at least 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
