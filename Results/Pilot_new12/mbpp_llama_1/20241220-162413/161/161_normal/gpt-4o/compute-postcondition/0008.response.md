The given code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then adds the original value of `a` to the new value of `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. 

After executing the code, `a` takes the value of the original `b` which is 1, and `b` takes the value of the original `a` plus the original `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3.

The value of `n` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
