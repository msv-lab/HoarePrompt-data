According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already given as not equal to 1 and a positive integer, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. The variables `a` and `b` do not affect the loop's execution. The loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be assigned a specific value outside the loop. However, since the range starts at 2, we can consider the first iteration of the loop to start with the value 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is at least 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
