According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3. The loop variable `_` is not directly relevant to the state, but its value would be the current number in the range. 

Since the loop has already executed once (with `_` being 2), for it to execute again, `_` would need to be 3, and `n` must be at least 3 to include 3 in the range. The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
