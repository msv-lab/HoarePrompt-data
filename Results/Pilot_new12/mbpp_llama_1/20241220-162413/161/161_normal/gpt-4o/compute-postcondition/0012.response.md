To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step.

The code is: `a, b = b, a + b`

Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4.

After executing the code:
- The value of `a` becomes the initial value of `b`, which is 4.
- The value of `b` becomes the sum of the initial values of `a` and `b`, which is 3 + 4 = 7.

The value of `n` is not affected by this code, so it remains a positive integer and at least 4.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**
