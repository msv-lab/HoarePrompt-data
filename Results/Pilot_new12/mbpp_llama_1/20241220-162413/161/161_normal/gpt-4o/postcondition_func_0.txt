The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the Fibonacci sequence starting with 2 and 1. Specifically, it returns `2` if `n` equals 0, `1` if `n` equals 1, and the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence if `n` is greater than 1. The function handles all non-negative integers, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and correctly calculates the nth Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1, effectively providing the nth number in the modified Fibonacci sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
