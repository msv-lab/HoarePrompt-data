You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses Python's list slicing feature to split the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, each containing every `n`th element starting from a different index. This is achieved by iterating over a range of `n` and using `i::n` as the slice for each sublist, where `i` is the starting index.

This solution works as expected for all possible inputs because it correctly handles the following scenarios:

*   When `n` is greater than the length of the list, it simply returns `n` empty sublists (except for the first one which may contain elements if `n` is 1 more than a factor of the list length).
*   When `n` equals 1, it returns `n` sublists where each sublist contains the original list.
*   When `n` is equal to the length of the list, it returns `n` sublists where each sublist contains exactly one element.

Overall, the function correctly splits the input list into sublists as described in the problem statement, handling various edge cases and providing the expected output for all possible inputs.

Example usage:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)) 
# Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3)) 
# Output: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as input, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst`, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This means that the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, `n`, 2`n`,..., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, `n+1`, 2`n+1`,..., and so on. The function handles edge cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing `lst` itself as the only sublist. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
