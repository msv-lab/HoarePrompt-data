Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst`, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

The code `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` uses Python's list slicing feature to create the sublists. The expression `lst[i::n]` generates a slice of `lst` starting at index `i` and stepping by `n`. The outer list comprehension iterates over the range of `n` to generate the `n` sublists.

The code correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. It also correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, in which case the function returns a list containing `lst` itself as the only sublist.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality, and no cases were found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
