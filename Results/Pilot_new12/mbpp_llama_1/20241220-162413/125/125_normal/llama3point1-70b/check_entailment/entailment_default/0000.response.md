Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It takes a list and an integer n as input, and returns a list of n sublists. Each sublist contains every nth element of the input list, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to n-1.

The code `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` uses list slicing to achieve this. The expression `lst[i::n]` generates a sublist containing every nth element of `lst`, starting from index `i`. The outer list comprehension iterates over the range of `n`, generating `n` such sublists.

The output hints agree with the code, describing the correct behavior for various edge cases, such as when `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, when `n` is 1, and when the input list is not empty.

The code does not modify the original list `lst` and handles edge cases as expected. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the code does not need to handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where the input is not a list.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description, and there are no obvious cases where it would fail to produce the expected output.
