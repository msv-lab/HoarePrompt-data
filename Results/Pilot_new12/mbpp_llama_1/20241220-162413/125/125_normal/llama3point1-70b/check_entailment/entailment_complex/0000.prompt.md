You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n sublists of 'lst', where each sublist contains every nth element of 'lst' starting from a different initial index from 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as input, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst`, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This means that the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, `n`, 2`n`,..., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, `n+1`, 2`n+1`,..., and so on. The function handles edge cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing `lst` itself as the only sublist. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
