You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1.
- For each number `i` in this sequence, `lst[i::n]` creates a slice of the original list, starting at index `i` and including every nth element thereafter.
- The resulting slices are collected in a new list, which is then returned.

This approach effectively splits the input list into n sublists, where the first sublist contains every nth element starting from index 0, the second sublist contains every nth element starting from index 1, and so on.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n` is 3, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected result.

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty input lists: The function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, depending on the value of `n`.
- Input lists with a length that is not a multiple of `n`: The function will still split the list correctly, with the last sublist potentially being shorter than the others.
- Input lists with a single element: The function will return a list containing the single element, wrapped in a list.
- Input lists with `n` equal to 1: The function will return a list containing the original list.
- Input lists with `n` greater than the length of the list: The function will return a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a single element from the original list, or an empty list if the index is out of range.

Overall, the function is correct and handles all potential cases as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as input, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst`, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This means that the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, `n`, 2`n`,..., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, `n+1`, 2`n+1`,..., and so on. The function handles edge cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing `lst` itself as the only sublist. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
