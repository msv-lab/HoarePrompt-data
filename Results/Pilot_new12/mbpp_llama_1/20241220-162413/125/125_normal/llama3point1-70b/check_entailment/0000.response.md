Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses Python's list slicing feature to split the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, each containing every `n`th element starting from a different index. This is achieved by iterating over a range of `n` and using `i::n` as the slice for each sublist, where `i` is the starting index.

This solution works as expected for all possible inputs because it correctly handles the following scenarios:

*   When `n` is greater than the length of the list, it simply returns `n` empty sublists (except for the first one which may contain elements if `n` is 1 more than a factor of the list length).
*   When `n` equals 1, it returns `n` sublists where each sublist contains the original list.
*   When `n` is equal to the length of the list, it returns `n` sublists where each sublist contains exactly one element.

Overall, the function correctly splits the input list into sublists as described in the problem statement, handling various edge cases and providing the expected output for all possible inputs.

Example usage:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)) 
# Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3)) 
# Output: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
