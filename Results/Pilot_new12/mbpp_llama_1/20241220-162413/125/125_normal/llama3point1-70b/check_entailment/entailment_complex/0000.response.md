Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst` starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. 

Here's why it works:

- The function uses list slicing (`lst[i::n]`) to generate each sublist. The `i::n` slicing means "start at index `i` and take every `n`th element", which is exactly what the problem description requires.
- The function uses a list comprehension to generate `n` sublists, one for each initial index from 0 to `n-1`. This ensures that every `n`th element of `lst` is included in the output, starting from a different initial index for each sublist.
- The function handles edge cases correctly. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, some sublists may be empty, but the function still returns a list of `n` sublists as required. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing `lst` itself as the only sublist, which is also correct.

Overall, the function `func_1` implements the required behavior, and it does so in a concise and efficient manner. Therefore, the program is correct.
