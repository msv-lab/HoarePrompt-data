Based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1` does indeed split the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, each containing every `n`th element starting from a different index. The function handles various edge cases, such as when `n` is greater than the length of the list, when `n` equals 1, and when `n` is equal to the length of the list.

The output hints provide further evidence of the function's correctness, stating that the function returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst`, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This matches the behavior observed in the provided code and example usage.

One potential concern could be the handling of edge cases where `n` is not a factor of the length of `lst`. However, the output hints acknowledge that in such cases, some sublists may be empty, which is a reasonable and expected behavior.

Given the evidence from the annotations, the original assessment, and the output hints, it appears that the program meets the problem description and behaves as expected.

Final: **True**.
