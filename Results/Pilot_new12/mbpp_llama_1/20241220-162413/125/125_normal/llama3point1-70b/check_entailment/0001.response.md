Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The function uses list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1.
- For each number `i` in this sequence, `lst[i::n]` creates a slice of the original list, starting at index `i` and including every nth element thereafter.
- The resulting slices are collected in a new list, which is then returned.

This approach effectively splits the input list into n sublists, where the first sublist contains every nth element starting from index 0, the second sublist contains every nth element starting from index 1, and so on.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n` is 3, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which is the expected result.

This function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty input lists: The function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, depending on the value of `n`.
- Input lists with a length that is not a multiple of `n`: The function will still split the list correctly, with the last sublist potentially being shorter than the others.
- Input lists with a single element: The function will return a list containing the single element, wrapped in a list.
- Input lists with `n` equal to 1: The function will return a list containing the original list.
- Input lists with `n` greater than the length of the list: The function will return a list of sublists, where each sublist contains a single element from the original list, or an empty list if the index is out of range.

Overall, the function is correct and handles all potential cases as expected.
