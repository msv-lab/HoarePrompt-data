Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst` starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling edge cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, as well as cases where `n` is 1. The function also does not modify the original list `lst`, which is a desirable property.

The provided example usage in the original assessment further supports the correctness of the program, demonstrating that the function produces the expected output for different inputs.

The annotated version of the code does not provide any evidence that would suggest the original assessment is incorrect. On the contrary, it reinforces the conclusion that the function `func_1` is a correct implementation of the problem description.

Therefore, the refined assessment of the program's correctness remains **True**, and the reason for this assessment is that the function correctly implements the problem description, handling various edge cases and producing the expected output for all possible valid inputs.

Final: **True**
