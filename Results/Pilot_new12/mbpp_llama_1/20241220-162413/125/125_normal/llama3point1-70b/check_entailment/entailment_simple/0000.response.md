Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

The provided function `func_1` achieves this by using list slicing to create n sublists of the original list `lst`. The slicing `[i::n]` creates a sublist starting from index `i` and taking every nth element.

Here's why it works:

- For `i = 0`, it creates a sublist with every nth element starting from the first element of `lst`.
- For `i = 1`, it creates a sublist with every nth element starting from the second element of `lst`.
- This continues until `i = n-1`, where it creates a sublist with every nth element starting from the nth element of `lst`.

The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates all these sublists and returns them as a list of lists.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`, which are the sublists of `lst` created by taking every 3rd element starting from different initial indices.

This matches the problem description, so the program is correct.
