The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of n sublists of `lst`. Each sublist contains every nth element of `lst` starting from a different initial index from 0 to n-1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of n sublists of `lst`, where each sublist contains every nth element of `lst` starting from a different initial index from 0 to n-1.**
