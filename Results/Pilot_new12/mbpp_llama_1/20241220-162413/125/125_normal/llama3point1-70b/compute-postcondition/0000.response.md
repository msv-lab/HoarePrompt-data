To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `lst` is a list.
- `n` is a positive integer.

Given Code:
```python
return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

This code uses list comprehension to create a new list of lists. Here's how it works:

1. `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to but not including `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, this will produce a sequence of `n` numbers (0, 1, 2,..., n-1).

2. For each `i` in this sequence, `lst[i::n]` slices the list `lst`. The slicing syntax `[start:stop:step]` means:
   - `start`: Start at index `i`.
   - `stop`: Goes to the end of the list since no value is provided.
   - `step`: Steps through the list `n` elements at a time.

3. The result of `lst[i::n]` for each `i` is a sublist of `lst`, starting at index `i` and including every `n`th element thereafter.

4. These sublists are collected into a new list, which is then returned.

Given that `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer, the output will be a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist will contain elements from `lst`, starting at a different initial index (from 0 to `n-1`), and will include every `n`th element from that starting point.

Therefore, the program returns a list of lists, where each sublist is a slice of the original list `lst`, stepped by `n` from different starting indices.

Output State: **The program returns a list of n sublists of 'lst', where each sublist contains every nth element of 'lst' starting from a different initial index from 0 to n-1.**
