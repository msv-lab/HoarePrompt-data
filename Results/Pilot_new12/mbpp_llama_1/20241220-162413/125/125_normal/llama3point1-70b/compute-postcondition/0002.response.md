Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` as input, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains every `n`th element of `lst`, starting from a different initial index ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This means that the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, `n`, 2`n`,..., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, `n+1`, 2`n+1`,..., and so on. The function handles edge cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, in which case some sublists may be empty. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing `lst` itself as the only sublist. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.**
