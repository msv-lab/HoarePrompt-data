#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is the original list, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where each element from `lst` is distributed across these lists based on the index modulo `n`, `i` is the last index of `lst` (or -1 if `lst` is empty, but since Python's enumerate starts from 0, `i` would be `len(lst) - 1` if `lst` is not empty), and `element` is the last element of `lst` (or undefined if `lst` is empty).
    return result
    #The program returns a list of `n` lists where each element from the original list `lst` is distributed across these lists based on the index modulo `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed based on their index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. If `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. If `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, some of the resulting lists will be empty. The function handles cases where `n` is 1 or greater, and where `lst` contains any type of elements. After execution, the function's return value is a list of `n` lists, with each inner list containing elements from `lst` distributed according to their original index modulo `n`.
