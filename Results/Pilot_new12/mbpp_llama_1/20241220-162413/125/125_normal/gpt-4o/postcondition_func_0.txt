The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed based on their index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. If `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. If `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, some of the resulting lists will be empty. The function handles cases where `n` is 1 or greater, and where `lst` contains any type of elements. After execution, the function's return value is a list of `n` lists, with each inner list containing elements from `lst` distributed according to their original index modulo `n`.
