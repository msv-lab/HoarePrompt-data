Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `n` and splits the list into `n` sublists, where the `i-th` element of the original list goes to the `(i % n)-th` sublist. The output hints agree with this description.

Upon reviewing the code, we can see that it correctly handles all potential cases. The function initializes a list of `n` empty lists and then distributes the elements from the original list into these sublists based on their index modulo `n`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all valid inputs, including cases where `n` is larger than the length of the list, where `n` is 1, and where the list contains elements of any type.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function for different inputs. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the described behavior for all potential cases.
