Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to split the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the given program does not quite meet this requirement.

The issue lies in the way the program distributes the elements of the original list across the resulting lists. Instead of splitting the list for every nth element, the program uses the index modulo n to distribute the elements. This means that the elements are not necessarily grouped into lists of length n, but rather into lists where each element from the original list is placed in a list based on its index modulo n.

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the program will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is not the expected result of `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`.

To meet the problem description, the program should be modified to create a new list every nth element, rather than using the index modulo n to distribute the elements. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to meet the problem description:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    current_list = []
    for element in lst:
        current_list.append(element)
        if len(current_list) == n:
            result.append(current_list)
            current_list = []
    if current_list:
        result.append(current_list)
    return result
```
This modified program will return the expected result of `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` for the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`.
