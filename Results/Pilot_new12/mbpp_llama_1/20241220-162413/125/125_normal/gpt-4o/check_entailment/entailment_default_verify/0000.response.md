Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

The original assessment states that the function, `func_1`, correctly splits the input list into `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list. This assessment is supported by the provided unit tests, which demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.

The output hints further clarify the function's behavior, stating that it distributes elements from the input list based on their index modulo `n`, leaving the original list unchanged. The hints also mention that the function handles cases where the input list is empty, `n` is larger than the length of the input list, and where `n` is 1 or greater.

Upon examining the code, I see that it uses a list comprehension to create `n` empty sublists and then iterates over the input list using `enumerate`. The expression `i % n` correctly calculates the index of the sublist where each element should be appended. This implementation aligns with the problem description and the output hints.

Given that the original assessment is consistent with the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

The reason I think the original assessment is accurate is that the function's implementation correctly splits the input list into `n` sublists, as required by the problem description. The function's behavior, as described by the output hints, is consistent with this implementation. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
