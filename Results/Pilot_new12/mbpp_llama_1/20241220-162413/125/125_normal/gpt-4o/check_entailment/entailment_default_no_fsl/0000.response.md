Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to create `n` empty lists, and then iterates over the input list `lst`, distributing each element to one of the `n` lists based on its index modulo `n`. This approach ensures that the elements are correctly distributed according to their original index modulo `n`.

The program handles various cases correctly, such as:

* When `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, some of the resulting lists will be empty.
* When `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing a single list, which is a copy of the original list `lst`.
* When `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists.
* When `lst` contains any type of elements, the function handles it correctly.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different inputs.

Since the problem description assumes that the input will be valid (i.e., a list and a positive integer), the program does not need to handle cases with invalid inputs, such as a non-list input or a non-positive integer.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
