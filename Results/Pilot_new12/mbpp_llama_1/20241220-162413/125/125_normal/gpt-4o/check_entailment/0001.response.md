Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully splits the input list into sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the input list. The code uses the modulus operator (`i % n`) to determine which sublist each element should be appended to. This approach ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the sublists.

The code also handles edge cases, such as when the length of the input list is not a multiple of n, by simply appending the remaining elements to the corresponding sublists.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various input scenarios. The code's logic is sound, and it does not contain any obvious errors or omissions that would cause it to fail for certain inputs.

In particular, the code handles the following scenarios correctly:

* When the length of the input list is a multiple of n, the sublists are filled evenly.
* When the length of the input list is not a multiple of n, the sublists are filled as expected, with the remaining elements appended to the corresponding sublists.
* When n is 1, the code returns a list containing the original input list.
* When n is greater than the length of the input list, the code returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains at most one element.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
