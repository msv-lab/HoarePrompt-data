Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, takes a list and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` sublists. The function iterates over the input list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `element` of each item in the list. The expression `i % n` calculates the index of the sublist where the current element should be appended. This effectively splits the input list into `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`-th element from the original list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n` is `3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

The function handles edge cases correctly as well, such as when the input list is empty or when `n` is greater than the length of the input list. In these cases, the function will return a list of empty sublists or a list with fewer than `n` sublists, respectively.

Overall, the function appears to correctly implement the required behavior, and no cases where the function does not work as expected could be found.
