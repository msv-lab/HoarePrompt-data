You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully splits the input list into sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the input list. The code uses the modulus operator (`i % n`) to determine which sublist each element should be appended to. This approach ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the sublists.

The code also handles edge cases, such as when the length of the input list is not a multiple of n, by simply appending the remaining elements to the corresponding sublists.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program for various input scenarios. The code's logic is sound, and it does not contain any obvious errors or omissions that would cause it to fail for certain inputs.

In particular, the code handles the following scenarios correctly:

* When the length of the input list is a multiple of n, the sublists are filled evenly.
* When the length of the input list is not a multiple of n, the sublists are filled as expected, with the remaining elements appended to the corresponding sublists.
* When n is 1, the code returns a list containing the original input list.
* When n is greater than the length of the input list, the code returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains at most one element.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed based on their index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. If `lst` is empty, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. If `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, some of the resulting lists will be empty. The function handles cases where `n` is 1 or greater, and where `lst` contains any type of elements. After execution, the function's return value is a list of `n` lists, with each inner list containing elements from `lst` distributed according to their original index modulo `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
