Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input, and returns a list of `n` lists where each element from `lst` is distributed across these lists based on the index modulo `n`. This effectively splits the list for every nth element.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes a list `result` with `n` empty lists using a list comprehension.
2. It then iterates over the input list `lst` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the value `element` of each item in the list.
3. For each element, it appends it to the list at index `i % n` in the `result` list. This effectively distributes the elements of `lst` across the `n` lists in `result`, where each element is placed in the list corresponding to its index modulo `n`.
4. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the `n` lists of distributed elements.

This implementation correctly splits the input list into `n` lists, where each list contains every nth element from the original list, starting from the first element. The provided unit tests demonstrate this behavior and verify that the function works as expected.

In general, the program's correctness can be attributed to the following factors:

* The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to distribute elements across the `n` lists.
* The initialization of the `result` list with `n` empty lists to store the distributed elements.
* The iteration over the input list using `enumerate` to access both the index and value of each element.
* The correct appending of elements to the corresponding lists in the `result` list based on their indices.

Overall, the program's implementation accurately reflects the problem description, and it correctly splits the input list into `n` lists for every nth element.
