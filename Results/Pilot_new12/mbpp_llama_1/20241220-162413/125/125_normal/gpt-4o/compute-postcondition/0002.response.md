To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.
- `i` is 0.
- `element` is the first element in `lst`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
result[i % n].append(element)
```

Given that `i` is 0, `i % n` will always be 0 regardless of the value of `n`, because any number modulo 0 is undefined but in this case, since `i` is 0, it results in 0. 

Therefore, `result[0]` will have the `element` appended to it. The `element` is the first element of `lst`.

The output state is:
- `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `result` is a list where the first sublist (`result[0]`) now contains the first element of `lst`, and the rest of the sublists remain empty.
- `i` is 0.
- `element` is the first element in `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where `result[0]` contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`.**
