The code `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the value of `element` to the sublist in `result` indexed by `i % n`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. 

The expression `i % n` evaluates to `1 % n`, which equals 1 because any positive integer modulo another positive integer where the dividend is less than the divisor equals the dividend. Therefore, `result[1]` is the sublist that will be appended with `element`, which is the second element of `lst`.

Since `result[1]` initially contains the second element of `lst` and now it's being appended with the second element of `lst` again, `result[1]` will now contain two instances of the second element of `lst`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where `result[0]` contains the first element of `lst` and `result[1]` contains two instances of the second element of `lst`, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where `result[0]` contains the first element of `lst` and `result[1]` contains two instances of the second element of `lst`, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`**
