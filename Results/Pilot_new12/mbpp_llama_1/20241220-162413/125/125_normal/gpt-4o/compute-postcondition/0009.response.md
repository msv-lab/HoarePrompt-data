The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of `n` lists where each element from the original list `lst` is distributed across these lists based on the index modulo `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed based on their index modulo `n`.**
