The code `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the `element` to the sublist in `result` at the index `i % n`.

Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer, `i % n` will be 2 if `n` is greater than 2. Since `result` is a list of `n` lists and `n` is a positive integer, and given the initial state of `result`, `n` must be at least 3 to accommodate the described initial state of `result`. Therefore, `i % n` will be 2.

The `element` is the third element in `lst`, and `result[2]` initially contains three instances of this element. After appending `element` to `result[2]`, it will contain four instances of the third element of `lst`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where `result[0]` contains the first element of `lst`, `result[1]` contains two instances of the second element of `lst`, and `result[2]` contains four instances of the third element of `lst`, `i` is 2, `element` is the third element in `lst`**
