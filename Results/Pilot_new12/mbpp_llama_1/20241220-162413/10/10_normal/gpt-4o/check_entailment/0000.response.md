Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is the area of the base times the height of the prism. In this case, the area of the base is calculated as `0.5 * base * height`, which is the formula for the area of a triangle. This area is then multiplied by the `length` of the prism to get the volume.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function is working as expected for different input values. The function correctly handles the formula and does not have any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail.

Since the function accurately implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a triangular prism and passes the given unit tests, it is considered correct. Without any additional information or test cases that would demonstrate the function's incorrectness, we can conclude that it works as intended.
