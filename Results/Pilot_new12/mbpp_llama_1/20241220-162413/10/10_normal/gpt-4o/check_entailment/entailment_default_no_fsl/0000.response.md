Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism given its base, height, and length. The function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is the area of the base (0.5 * base * height) multiplied by the length.

The function accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, and returns their product multiplied by 0.5, resulting in a positive number if all inputs are positive.

The output hints also agree with the code, and all provided unit tests pass correctly. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is non-positive or not a number.

The function does not need to validate if the inputs are indeed positive numbers or handle potential exceptions, as this is outside the scope of the problem description. The problem description only asks for a function to calculate the volume of a triangular prism, and the provided function does this correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
