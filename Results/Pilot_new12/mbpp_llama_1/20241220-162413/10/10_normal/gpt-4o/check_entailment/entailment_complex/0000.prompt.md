You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240
assert func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6
assert func_1(1, 2, 1) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: base, height, and length are positive numbers representing the base area, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume, which is 0.5 times the product of the positive base, height, and length, resulting in a positive number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism given its base, height, and length. It accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, and returns their product multiplied by 0.5, resulting in a positive number if all inputs are positive. However, it does not validate if the inputs are indeed positive numbers, so it may return negative or zero volume if any of the inputs are non-positive or if any of the inputs are not numbers. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the calculation, such as overflow or division by zero (though the latter is not applicable in this specific case since there are no divisions). The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns a single value representing the calculated volume, without altering the original input values or the external state.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
