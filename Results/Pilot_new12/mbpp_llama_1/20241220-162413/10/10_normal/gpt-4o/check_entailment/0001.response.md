Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `volume = base_area * length`, where `base_area` is the area of the triangular base and `length` is the length of the prism. 

The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula `base_area = 0.5 * base * height`, where `base` is the base of the triangle and `height` is the height of the triangle. 

The given function `func_1` correctly implements these formulas. It first calculates the base area using the provided base and height, then multiplies this area by the length to get the volume. 

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the code, it appears that the program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism for all potential cases. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric inputs. But based on the provided problem description, it seems that the function is expected to work with valid numeric inputs, and it does so correctly.
