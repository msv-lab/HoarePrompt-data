Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is 0.5 times the product of the base, height, and length, where the base is the area of the triangular base. 

In the given Python function `func_1(base, height, length)`, it first calculates the base area with `base_area = 0.5 * base * height`, and then calculates the volume with `volume = base_area * length`. This matches the formula for the volume of a triangular prism.

The function takes three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which correspond to the base and height of the triangular base and the length of the prism, respectively. The function returns the calculated volume, which is a positive number as expected.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240`, `assert func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6`, and `assert func_1(1, 2, 1) == 1` also validate the correctness of the function by checking its output against expected results.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., `base`, `height`, and `length` are positive numbers), the function does not need to handle invalid inputs, and its implementation directly addresses the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
