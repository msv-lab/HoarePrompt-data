The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. These parameters are positive numbers representing the base area, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is calculated as 0.5 times the product of the base, height, and length, resulting in a positive number.
