The code calculates the base area of the triangular prism using the formula: `base_area = 0.5 * base * height`. 

The value of `base_area` is directly calculated from the given `base` and `height` values.

Output State: **`base` is a positive number, `height` is a positive number, `length` is a positive number, `base_area` is `0.5 * base * height`**
