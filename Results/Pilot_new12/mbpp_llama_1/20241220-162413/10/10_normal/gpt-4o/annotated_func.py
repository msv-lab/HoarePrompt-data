#State of the program right berfore the function call: base, height, and length are positive numbers representing the base area, height, and length of the triangular prism, respectively.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume, which is 0.5 times the product of the positive base, height, and length, resulting in a positive number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism given its base, height, and length. It accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, and returns their product multiplied by 0.5, resulting in a positive number if all inputs are positive. However, it does not validate if the inputs are indeed positive numbers, so it may return negative or zero volume if any of the inputs are non-positive or if any of the inputs are not numbers. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the calculation, such as overflow or division by zero (though the latter is not applicable in this specific case since there are no divisions). The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns a single value representing the calculated volume, without altering the original input values or the external state.
