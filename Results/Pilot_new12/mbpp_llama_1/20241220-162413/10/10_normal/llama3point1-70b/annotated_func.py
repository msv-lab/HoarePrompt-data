#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of a triangular prism, where the volume is calculated as the base of the triangle times the height of the triangle divided by 2, then multiplied by the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism, given its base, height, and length as input parameters. It accepts three positive numbers, `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism), and returns their product multiplied by 0.5. The final state of the program after execution is the returned volume of the triangular prism. Note that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-positive input values, which may lead to incorrect results if the inputs do not meet the assumption of being positive numbers. The function's calculation is based solely on the formula `b * h / 2 * l`, without any consideration for potential edge cases such as division by zero or non-numeric input values.
