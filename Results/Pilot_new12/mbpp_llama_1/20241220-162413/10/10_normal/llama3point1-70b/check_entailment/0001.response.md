Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height of the triangle) / 2` and the height is the length of the prism. 

In this case, `b` represents the base of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism. 

The function correctly implements this formula by calculating `(b * h / 2) * l` and returning the result.

For example, if you have a triangular prism with a base of 5 units, a height of 6 units, and a length of 8 units, the function will correctly calculate the volume as `(5 * 6 / 2) * 8 = 120` cubic units.

Since the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and handles all potential cases, the program is correct.
