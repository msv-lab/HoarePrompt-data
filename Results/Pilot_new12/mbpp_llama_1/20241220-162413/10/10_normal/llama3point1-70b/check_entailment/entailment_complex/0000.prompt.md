You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of a triangular prism, where the volume is calculated as the base of the triangle times the height of the triangle divided by 2, then multiplied by the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism, given its base, height, and length as input parameters. It accepts three positive numbers, `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism), and returns their product multiplied by 0.5. The final state of the program after execution is the returned volume of the triangular prism. Note that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-positive input values, which may lead to incorrect results if the inputs do not meet the assumption of being positive numbers. The function's calculation is based solely on the formula `b * h / 2 * l`, without any consideration for potential edge cases such as division by zero or non-numeric input values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
