Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula `b * h / 2 * l`, where `b` is the base of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. This formula is mathematically correct and aligns with the problem description.

The output hints mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-positive input values. However, the problem description does not explicitly require the program to handle such cases, and we are assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the function's lack of error checking does not affect its correctness in this context.

Since the formula used in the function is correct and it meets the problem description's requirements, assuming valid inputs, the function should work correctly for every potential case.
