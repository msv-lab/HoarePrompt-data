The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided code. The reasoning behind this assessment is that the function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program before and after the function call. Before the function call, `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively. After the function call, the program returns the volume of a triangular prism, which is calculated as the base of the triangle times the height of the triangle divided by 2, then multiplied by the length of the prism.

Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1(b, h, l)` does indeed calculate the volume of a triangular prism using the correct formula. The annotations also confirm that the function is expected to receive positive numbers as input, which is a valid assumption according to the problem statement.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
