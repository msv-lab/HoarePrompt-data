Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to calculate the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by the formula: `V = (base * height) / 2 * length`. The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` implements this formula exactly, returning the result of `b * h / 2 * l`, which correctly calculates the volume of the triangular prism.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers), the function does not need to handle edge cases such as division by zero or non-numeric input values. The function's calculation is based solely on the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, and it correctly returns the result of this calculation.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct.
