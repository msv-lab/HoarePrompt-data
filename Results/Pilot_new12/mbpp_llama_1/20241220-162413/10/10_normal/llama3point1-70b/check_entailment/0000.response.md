Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this function, `b` represents the base of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism.

The function correctly implements this formula by returning `b * h / 2 * l`, which is the product of the base area and the length of the prism. This will give the correct volume for any valid input values of `b`, `h`, and `l`.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce an incorrect result. As long as the input values are valid (i.e., non-negative numbers), the function should work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
