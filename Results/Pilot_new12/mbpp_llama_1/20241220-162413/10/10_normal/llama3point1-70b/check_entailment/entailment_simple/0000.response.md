To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the description and the code.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is given by the area of the triangular base times the length of the prism. The area of the triangle is calculated as the base of the triangle times the height of the triangle divided by 2.

The given function `func_1(b, h, l)` takes three parameters: `b` (the base of the triangle), `h` (the height of the triangle), and `l` (the length of the prism). It returns the result of the calculation `b * h / 2 * l`, which correctly represents the volume of a triangular prism according to the formula.

Here's a breakdown of why this program is correct based on the problem description:

1. **Calculation Correctness**: The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is correctly implemented as `b * h / 2 * l`. This formula first calculates the area of the triangular base (`b * h / 2`) and then multiplies this area by the length of the prism (`l`), which gives the volume.

2. **Input Parameters**: The function takes the necessary and correct parameters to calculate the volume of a triangular prism, which are the base of the triangle (`b`), the height of the triangle (`h`), and the length of the prism (`l`).

3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers), we do not need to consider error checking or handling for invalid inputs.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input.

Correctness: **True**
