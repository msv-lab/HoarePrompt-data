You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this function, `b` represents the base of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle, and `l` represents the length of the prism.

The function correctly implements this formula by returning `b * h / 2 * l`, which is the product of the base area and the length of the prism. This will give the correct volume for any valid input values of `b`, `h`, and `l`.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce an incorrect result. As long as the input values are valid (i.e., non-negative numbers), the function should work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of a triangular prism, where the volume is calculated as the base of the triangle times the height of the triangle divided by 2, then multiplied by the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the volume of a triangular prism, given its base, height, and length as input parameters. It accepts three positive numbers, `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism), and returns their product multiplied by 0.5. The final state of the program after execution is the returned volume of the triangular prism. Note that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-positive input values, which may lead to incorrect results if the inputs do not meet the assumption of being positive numbers. The function's calculation is based solely on the formula `b * h / 2 * l`, without any consideration for potential edge cases such as division by zero or non-numeric input values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
