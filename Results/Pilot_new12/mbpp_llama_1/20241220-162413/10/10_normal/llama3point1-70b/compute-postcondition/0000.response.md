To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and length of the prism, respectively. The code snippet is `return b * h / 2 * l`.

Given the formula, it calculates the area of a triangle (`b * h / 2`) and then multiplies this area by the length of the prism (`l`). This calculation effectively gives the volume of a triangular prism, where the area of the base (a triangle) is multiplied by the height (length) of the prism.

Thus, when we substitute the given variables into the formula:
- `b` is the base of the triangle,
- `h` is the height of the triangle,
- `l` is the length of the prism,

The program returns the result of `b * h / 2 * l`, which represents the volume of the triangular prism.

Output State: **The program returns the volume of a triangular prism, where the volume is calculated as the base of the triangle times the height of the triangle divided by 2, then multiplied by the length of the prism.**
