The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, where `b` is the base of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. All three parameters are positive numbers. The function returns the volume of a triangular prism, calculated as `(b * h / 2) * l`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the base, height, and length of a triangular prism and return its volume.

Functionality: **The function accepts the base, height, and length of a triangular prism as positive numbers and returns its volume.**
