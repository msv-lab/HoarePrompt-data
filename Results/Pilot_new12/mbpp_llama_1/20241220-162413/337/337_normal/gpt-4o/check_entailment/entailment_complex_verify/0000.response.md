The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it calculates the sum of unique elements instead of the sum of non-repeated elements. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description, which specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, as it states that the function returns the sum of unique integers in the list. This is not equivalent to the sum of non-repeated elements, as pointed out in the original assessment.

The key difference between the sum of unique elements and the sum of non-repeated elements is that the former includes all elements that appear at least once in the list, while the latter only includes elements that appear exactly once in the list. The provided code, which uses the `set` function to calculate the sum of unique elements, does not distinguish between these two cases.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements, but instead calculates the sum of unique elements.

Final: **False**
