Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The issue lies in the fact that the `set()` function in Python only removes duplicates, but it does not take into account the fact that the original list may have had multiple occurrences of the same element, some of which should be excluded from the sum because they are repeated.

For example, if we have the list `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the `set()` function will return `{1, 2, 3}`, and the sum of these elements is `6`. However, the correct sum of non-repeated elements in the original list is `3`, because both `1` and `2` are repeated.

A correct implementation would count the occurrences of each element in the list, and only include those that occur exactly once in the sum. Here's an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list.
