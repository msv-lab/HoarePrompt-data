Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description requires the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the provided function calculates the sum of unique elements, not non-repeated elements. A non-repeated element is an element that appears only once in the list, whereas a unique element is an element that has no duplicates in the list, but may appear multiple times.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3], the function returns the sum of unique elements (1 + 2 + 3 = 6), but the problem description requires the function to return the sum of non-repeated elements (1 + 3 = 4).

To fix this, the function should iterate through the list, count the occurrences of each element, and only sum up the elements that appear once. Here's an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```
This corrected function first counts the occurrences of each element in the list using a dictionary, then sums up the elements that appear only once.
