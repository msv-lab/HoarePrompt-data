The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This is because the `set()` function in Python only removes duplicates, but it does not take into account the fact that the original list may have had multiple occurrences of the same element, some of which should be excluded from the sum because they are repeated.

The annotated version of the code provides the same implementation as the original code, with an additional comment explaining that the program returns the sum of unique integers in the list 'lst'. However, this comment does not accurately reflect the problem description, which asks for the sum of non-repeated elements.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that the original assessment is accurate. The `set()` function does indeed remove duplicates, but it does not distinguish between elements that appear only once and elements that appear multiple times. Therefore, the program will include all unique elements in the sum, regardless of whether they are repeated or not.

For example, if we have the list `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the `set()` function will return `{1, 2, 3}`, and the sum of these elements is `6`. However, the correct sum of non-repeated elements in the original list is `3`, because both `1` and `2` are repeated.

The provided assertions do not contradict this assessment, as they seem to be testing the sum of unique elements, not non-repeated elements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

Final: **False**
