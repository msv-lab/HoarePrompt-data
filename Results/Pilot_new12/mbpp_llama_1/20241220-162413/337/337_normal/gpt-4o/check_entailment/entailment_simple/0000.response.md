Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the provided program calculates the sum of unique elements, which is not the same thing.

The program uses the `set()` function to remove duplicates from the list and then calculates the sum of the remaining elements. This approach correctly identifies unique elements but does not distinguish between elements that appear once and those that appear multiple times in the original list.

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the program will return the sum of unique elements, which is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`. However, the sum of non-repeated elements is `1 + 4 = 5`, because only `1` and `4` appear once in the list.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should count the occurrences of each element and then sum up only those elements that appear exactly once. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in count.items() if value == 1)
```

This corrected program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element and then uses a generator expression to sum up only those elements that appear exactly once.
