Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in the case when there are repeated elements in the list but the problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, not the sum of unique elements. The sum of non-repeated elements means adding up the elements that appear only once in the list, not adding up all the unique elements. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the sum of non-repeated elements is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, but the given program would return 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is the sum of unique elements, not non-repeated elements.

A correct implementation would count the occurrence of each element and only add the elements that appear once to the sum. Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == 1)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements by counting the occurrence of each element and only adding the elements that appear once to the sum.
