You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in the case when there are repeated elements in the list but the problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, not the sum of unique elements. The sum of non-repeated elements means adding up the elements that appear only once in the list, not adding up all the unique elements. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the sum of non-repeated elements is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, but the given program would return 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is the sum of unique elements, not non-repeated elements.

A correct implementation would count the occurrence of each element and only add the elements that appear once to the sum. Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, freq in count.items() if freq == 1)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements by counting the occurrence of each element and only adding the elements that appear once to the sum.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input, and returns the sum of unique integers in the list. The function does not modify the original list. It handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with duplicate integers, and a list with negative integers, by returning 0 for an empty list and correctly summing unique integers in the other cases. The function assumes that the input is a list and does not include any error checking for non-list inputs or non-integer values within the list. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the sum of unique integers in the input list has been calculated and returned, with no side effects on the input list or other program variables.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
