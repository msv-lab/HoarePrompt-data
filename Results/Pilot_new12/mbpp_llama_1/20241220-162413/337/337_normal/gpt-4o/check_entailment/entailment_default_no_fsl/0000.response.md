Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, but the code actually calculates the sum of unique elements in the list, regardless of whether they are repeated or not.

To illustrate this, consider a list [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3] where the non-repeated element is 1 and the unique elements are 1, 2, and 3. The code will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, whereas the correct sum of non-repeated elements should be 1.

The correct implementation would involve counting the occurrences of each element and only including elements that appear once in the sum. 

Here is a simple example of how the function could be implemented in Python:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in counts.items() if value == 1)
```
This function first counts the occurrences of each element, then sums up the elements that appear only once. 

In the provided code, the function `func_1` uses the `set` function to get unique elements from the list and then sums them up. This approach does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

Therefore, the correctness of the provided code is **False**.
