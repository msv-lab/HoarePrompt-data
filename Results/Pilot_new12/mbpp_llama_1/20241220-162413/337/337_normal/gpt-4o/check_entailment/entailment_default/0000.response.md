Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by using a set to remove duplicate elements and then summing the unique elements. This approach correctly handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with duplicate integers, and a list with negative integers, as described in the output hints. 

The function's use of `sum(set(lst))` ensures that each unique integer in the list is counted exactly once in the sum, regardless of its frequency in the original list. This aligns with the problem description of finding the sum of non-repeated elements.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking for non-list inputs or non-integer values within the list does not affect the correctness of the function for valid inputs.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including lists with repeated elements, negative integers, and lists with no duplicates. Overall, the code correctly implements the sum of non-repeated elements as described in the problem, and it does so for every potential valid case.
