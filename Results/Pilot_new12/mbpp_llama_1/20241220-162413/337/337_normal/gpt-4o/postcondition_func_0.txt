The function accepts a list of integers as input, and returns the sum of unique integers in the list. The function does not modify the original list. It handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with duplicate integers, and a list with negative integers, by returning 0 for an empty list and correctly summing unique integers in the other cases. The function assumes that the input is a list and does not include any error checking for non-list inputs or non-integer values within the list. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the sum of unique integers in the input list has been calculated and returned, with no side effects on the input list or other program variables.
