#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list `lst` that appear only once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list, effectively ignoring integers that appear more than once. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, and it correctly returns the sum of unique integers in each of these cases. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0, as the sum of an empty set is defined to be 0. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it assumes that all elements in the list are integers. The function does not modify the original list and has no side effects, making it a pure function that only depends on its input.
