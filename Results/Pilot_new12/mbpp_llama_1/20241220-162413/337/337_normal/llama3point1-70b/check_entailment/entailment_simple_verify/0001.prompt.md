You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and includes it in the sum only if its count in the list is 1 (i.e., it appears only once).

The `lst.count(i)` method is used to count the occurrences of each element `i` in the list, and `sum` is used to calculate the sum of all such elements. This approach ensures that every element is checked for its frequency, and only those that occur once contribute to the sum.

To verify its correctness, we can consider various cases:

1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, `func_1` will return 0, which is the correct sum of non-repeated elements (since there are none).

2. **List with All Unique Elements**: If every element in the list is unique, the function will sum all elements, which is correct because all elements are non-repeated.

3. **List with Some Repeated Elements**: For lists containing a mix of unique and repeated elements, the function correctly identifies and sums only the unique elements.

4. **List with All Elements Repeated**: If every element in the list is repeated at least once, the function will correctly return 0, as there are no non-repeated elements.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and does not contain any logic that would fail for any potential input, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list `lst` that appear only once.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
