You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and includes it in the sum only if its count in the list is 1 (i.e., it appears only once).

The `lst.count(i)` method is used to count the occurrences of each element `i` in the list, and `sum` is used to calculate the sum of all such elements. This approach ensures that every element is checked for its frequency, and only those that occur once contribute to the sum.

To verify its correctness, we can consider various cases:

1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, `func_1` will return 0, which is the correct sum of non-repeated elements (since there are none).

2. **List with All Unique Elements**: If every element in the list is unique, the function will sum all elements, which is correct because all elements are non-repeated.

3. **List with Some Repeated Elements**: For lists containing a mix of unique and repeated elements, the function correctly identifies and sums only the unique elements.

4. **List with All Elements Repeated**: If every element in the list is repeated at least once, the function will correctly return 0, as there are no non-repeated elements.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and does not contain any logic that would fail for any potential input, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list, effectively ignoring integers that appear more than once. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, and it correctly returns the sum of unique integers in each of these cases. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0, as the sum of an empty set is defined to be 0. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it assumes that all elements in the list are integers. The function does not modify the original list and has no side effects, making it a pure function that only depends on its input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
