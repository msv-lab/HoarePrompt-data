Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`, and includes `i` in the sum if and only if `lst.count(i) == 1`, meaning `i` appears exactly once in the list.

The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty list (returning 0), a list with a single element (returning that element), and a list with duplicate elements (ignoring the duplicates). It also correctly handles lists with multiple unique elements.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and there are no examples provided where the function fails to produce the correct output. Additionally, since we assume that the input will be a valid list of integers, the function's potential issues with non-integer values or invalid inputs are not relevant in this context.

Overall, based on the problem description and the provided information, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality and handles all relevant cases.
