Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`, adding `i` to the sum if and only if `i` appears exactly once in `lst`, as determined by `lst.count(i) == 1`.

The function works correctly for several reasons:

1. **Correct Identification of Non-Repeated Elements:** The use of `lst.count(i) == 1` ensures that only elements appearing once in the list are considered for the sum. This directly aligns with the problem description's requirement to sum non-repeated elements.

2. **Handling of All Potential Cases:** The function iterates over every element in the list, thus considering all elements for the sum calculation. This means that regardless of the list's composition (e.g., all unique elements, all repeated elements, or a mix), the function will correctly identify and sum the non-repeated elements.

3. **Robustness Across Different Input Lists:** The function does not make assumptions about the list's size, the nature of its elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings), or whether the list is sorted or unsorted. It will work with any list of hashable elements (elements that can be counted using the `count` method), which includes the majority of types used in everyday programming tasks.

However, it's worth noting that for very large lists, this function might be inefficient due to the `count` method's O(n) complexity, potentially leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^2). Nonetheless, in terms of correctness for all potential cases as defined by the problem description, the function is accurate. It correctly sums the non-repeated elements without exceptions or omissions, fulfilling the task as specified.
