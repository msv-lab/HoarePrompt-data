Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all non-repeated elements in the list. 

Here is a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the input list `lst`.
2. For each element `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in the list is equal to 1 using the `count` method. If the count is 1, it means that `i` appears only once in the list.
3. The `sum` function then adds up all the unique elements `i` that appear only once in the list.
4. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements correctly. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0 because the sum of an empty set is defined to be 0.

Overall, the program does what the problem description asks for, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list of integers, assuming the input is valid and does not cause any errors.
