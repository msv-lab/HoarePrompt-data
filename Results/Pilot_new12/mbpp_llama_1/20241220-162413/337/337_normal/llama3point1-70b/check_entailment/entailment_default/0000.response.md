Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the problem description by finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and only include elements that have a count of 1, effectively ignoring integers that appear more than once. The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function handles various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements. The function also correctly returns the sum of unique integers in each of these cases. 

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the code seems to work correctly in every potential case. The output hints do mention that the function may raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results if the input list contains non-integer values, but since we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), this is not considered an error case. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and appears to handle all potential cases as expected.
