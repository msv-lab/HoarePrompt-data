You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`, adding `i` to the sum if and only if `i` appears exactly once in `lst`, as determined by `lst.count(i) == 1`.

The function works correctly for several reasons:

1. **Correct Identification of Non-Repeated Elements:** The use of `lst.count(i) == 1` ensures that only elements appearing once in the list are considered for the sum. This directly aligns with the problem description's requirement to sum non-repeated elements.

2. **Handling of All Potential Cases:** The function iterates over every element in the list, thus considering all elements for the sum calculation. This means that regardless of the list's composition (e.g., all unique elements, all repeated elements, or a mix), the function will correctly identify and sum the non-repeated elements.

3. **Robustness Across Different Input Lists:** The function does not make assumptions about the list's size, the nature of its elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings), or whether the list is sorted or unsorted. It will work with any list of hashable elements (elements that can be counted using the `count` method), which includes the majority of types used in everyday programming tasks.

However, it's worth noting that for very large lists, this function might be inefficient due to the `count` method's O(n) complexity, potentially leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^2). Nonetheless, in terms of correctness for all potential cases as defined by the problem description, the function is accurate. It correctly sums the non-repeated elements without exceptions or omissions, fulfilling the task as specified.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list `lst` that appear only once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list, effectively ignoring integers that appear more than once. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate elements, and it correctly returns the sum of unique integers in each of these cases. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0, as the sum of an empty set is defined to be 0. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a TypeError or produce incorrect results, as it assumes that all elements in the list are integers. The function does not modify the original list and has no side effects, making it a pure function that only depends on its input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
