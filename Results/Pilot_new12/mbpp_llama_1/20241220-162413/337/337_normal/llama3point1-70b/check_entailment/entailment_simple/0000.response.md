Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately implements the behavior described in the problem description. It calculates the sum of all non-repeated elements in a given list. Here's why it aligns with the problem description:

1. The function iterates over each element `i` in the input list `lst`.
2. For each element `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1, effectively identifying elements that appear only once.
3. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to add up all the elements that meet the condition of appearing only once.
4. The result is the sum of all unique (non-repeated) elements in the list, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and not cause any errors, this function will correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements for any list of integers provided to it, adhering to the problem description's requirements.
