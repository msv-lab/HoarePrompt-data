Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and includes it in the sum only if its count in the list is 1 (i.e., it appears only once).

The `lst.count(i)` method is used to count the occurrences of each element `i` in the list, and `sum` is used to calculate the sum of all such elements. This approach ensures that every element is checked for its frequency, and only those that occur once contribute to the sum.

To verify its correctness, we can consider various cases:

1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, `func_1` will return 0, which is the correct sum of non-repeated elements (since there are none).

2. **List with All Unique Elements**: If every element in the list is unique, the function will sum all elements, which is correct because all elements are non-repeated.

3. **List with Some Repeated Elements**: For lists containing a mix of unique and repeated elements, the function correctly identifies and sums only the unique elements.

4. **List with All Elements Repeated**: If every element in the list is repeated at least once, the function will correctly return 0, as there are no non-repeated elements.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and does not contain any logic that would fail for any potential input, it is considered correct.
