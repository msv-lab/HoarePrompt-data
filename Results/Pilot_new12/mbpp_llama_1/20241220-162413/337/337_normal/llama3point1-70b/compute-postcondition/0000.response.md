To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state. The initial state is that `lst` is a list of integers. The code snippet is designed to return the sum of all integers in `lst` that appear only once in the list.

The code uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each integer `i` in `lst`. For each `i`, it checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1. If it is, then `i` is included in the sum.

Given that `lst` is a list of integers, the code will return the sum of all unique integers in `lst`, where "unique" means that the integer appears only once in the list.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of all integers in the list `lst` that appear only once.**
