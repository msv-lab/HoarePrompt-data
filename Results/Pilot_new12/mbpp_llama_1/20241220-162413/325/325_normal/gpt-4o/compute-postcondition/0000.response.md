The given code defines a set `months_with_30_days` containing the months (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days. This code does not modify the `month` variable. The state of `month` remains unchanged as it is still an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12. 

A new variable `months_with_30_days` is added to the state. This variable is a set containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12, `months_with_30_days` is a set {4, 6, 9, 11}**
