To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and code step by step:

1. `month` is an integer with a value between 1 and 12 (inclusive), which represents the months of the year.
2. `months_with_30_days` is a set containing the months {4, 6, 9, 11}, which are the months that have 30 days in the Gregorian calendar.
3. The code `return month in months_with_30_days` checks if the value of `month` is present in the set `months_with_30_days`.

Given this, the program will return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the `month` has 30 days or not.

- If `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, the program returns `True`, because these months have 30 days.
- If `month` is any other value between 1 and 12 (excluding 4, 6, 9, 11), the program returns `False`, because these months either have 28/29 days (February) or 31 days (all other months).

Output State: **The program returns True if the month is one of {4, 6, 9, 11} and False otherwise**
