Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the months that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function then checks if the input month is in this set, returning True if it is and False otherwise.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function returns True for the months with 30 days and False otherwise. The function also handles all possible month values within the valid range of 1 to 12, as specified in the problem description.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(6) == True`, `assert func_1(2) == False`, and `assert func_1(12) == False` demonstrate the correctness of the function for specific cases. Since the function correctly implements the required logic and handles all possible month values, it is correct.

Note that, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid, i.e., a positive integer between 1 and 12, and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, we do not need to consider cases where the input is invalid.
