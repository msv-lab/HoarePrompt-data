The original assessment of the program's correctness is **False**, but after carefully reviewing the problem description, the code, and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the original assessment is incorrect.

The problem description asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a month as an integer and returns `True` if the month is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which corresponds to the months April, June, September, and November, and `False` otherwise.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the function's behavior and confirms that it correctly determines whether a given month has 30 days. The function handles all possible month values within the valid range of 1 to 12 and returns the expected result.

The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program does not account for other months that might have 30 days. However, the problem description and the code clearly indicate that the function should return `True` only for the months with exactly 30 days, which are April, June, September, and November.

The only potential issue mentioned in the original assessment is the handling of invalid month values outside the range of 1 to 12. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
