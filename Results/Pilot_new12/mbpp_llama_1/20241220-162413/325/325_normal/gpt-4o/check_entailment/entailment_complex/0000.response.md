Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are correctly represented in the set `months_with_30_days`.

The function takes an integer `month` as input, where `1 <= month <= 12`, and returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(6) == True` and `assert func_1(2) == False`, further demonstrate that the function behaves as expected.

The program's logic is straightforward and correct: it simply checks for membership of the input `month` in the predefined set of months with 30 days, which ensures that it meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid input values.
