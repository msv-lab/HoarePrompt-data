Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function `func_1` uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store these months and returns `True` if the input `month` is in this set, and `False` otherwise. This directly meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks to write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February does not always have 30 days (it has 28 or 29 days).
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because December has 31 days.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., an integer between 1 and 12), the function correctly identifies months with 30 days and returns the expected result for every potential case.
