Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November).

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it handles the following scenarios:

- It correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November).
- It correctly identifies the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) as not having 30 days.
- It correctly handles February, which has 28 or 29 days, depending on whether it is a leap year or not, and is not considered a month with 30 days.

The function uses a simple and efficient approach by storing the months with 30 days in a set and performing a membership test to determine if the given month has 30 days. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all inputs between 1 and 12.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Since the function handles all possible cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases or potential errors, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
