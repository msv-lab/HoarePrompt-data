Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it accurately determines whether a given month has 30 days, returning True if the month is April, June, September, or November, and False otherwise. The function handles all possible month values within the valid range of 1 to 12, as specified in the problem description.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(6) == True` and `assert func_1(2) == False`, demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different inputs. The code also does not include any error checking or handling for invalid month values outside of the range of 1 to 12, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this is not an issue.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November, and False otherwise, which matches the behavior of the `func_1` function.

Since we cannot find any example where the program does not work as expected in the description, and all the examples we can think of work correctly, we conclude that the code is correct.
