Correctness: **True**

The code provides a function `func_1` that takes a month number as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the month has 30 days or not. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` for months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and `False` otherwise. The code defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the month numbers of the months with 30 days and uses the `in` operator to check if the input month is in this list.

The code correctly handles all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, providing a clear boolean indication of the month's day count. The code does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled.

Since the input is assumed to be valid (a positive integer between 1 and 12), the code does not need to handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., negative numbers, zero, or non-integer values). The function is designed to work with valid input, and it does so correctly.

In summary, the code is correct because it accurately implements the problem description, handles all possible cases, and provides the expected output for each month.
