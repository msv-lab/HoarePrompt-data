Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1(month)` checks whether a given month has 30 days. The function correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and returns `True` for these months and `False` for the rest. 

The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers of the months with 30 days. The `in` operator is then used to check if the given month is in this list.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function covers all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases. 

Since the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., an integer between 1 and 12), the function will work correctly for all possible inputs. The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, integers outside the range 1-12), but this is not a requirement based on the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
