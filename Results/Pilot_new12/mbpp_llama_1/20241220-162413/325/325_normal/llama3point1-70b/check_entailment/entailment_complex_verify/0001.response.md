The original assessment correctly states that the program is correct because it accurately identifies the months that contain 30 days. The function `func_1` checks if the given month number is in the list `thirty_days_months`, which includes the months April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). These are the only months that have 30 days.

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment, stating that the function returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), and `False` otherwise. The annotation also notes that the function covers all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases, providing a clear boolean indication of the month's day count.

Given that the problem description asks for a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not, and the provided code correctly implements this functionality, the original assessment is accurate. The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
