The original assessment states that the program is correct, and upon analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that this assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number corresponds to a month with 30 days in the standard Gregorian calendar. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are correctly identified by the function.

The output hints support this conclusion by stating that the function determines whether a given month has 30 days and returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November, and `False` otherwise, covering all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases. This description matches the behavior of the `func_1` function, confirming its correctness.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., an integer between 1 and 12), the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no indications from the output hints or the problem description that the function fails to meet the requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is maintained because it correctly reflects the program's behavior and its alignment with the problem description.

Final: **True**
