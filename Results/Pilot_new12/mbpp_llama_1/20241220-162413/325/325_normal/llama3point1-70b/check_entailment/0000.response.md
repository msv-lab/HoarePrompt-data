Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The problem statement describes the task as identifying months with 30 days, given that months are represented as numbers from 1 to 12. 

The function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 30 days by checking if the input month number is in the list `thirty_days_months`, which includes the months April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). These are the only months in the standard Gregorian calendar that have exactly 30 days.

Given the function's simple and accurate implementation, it correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For any input month number from 1 to 12, it will return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the function does not handle correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for all specified inputs and scenarios.
