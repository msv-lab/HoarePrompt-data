Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. The problem asks to create a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers of April, June, September, and November, which are the only months with 30 days. It then checks if the input month is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This implementation covers all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases. The program assumes that the input will be a valid integer between 1 and 12, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description.

The function's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, making it a correct and efficient solution to the problem. It always returns `True` if the month has 30 days (April, June, September, or November) and `False` otherwise, which is exactly what the problem description requires.
