Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately identifies the months that contain 30 days. The function `func_1` checks if the given month number is in the list `thirty_days_months`, which includes the months April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). These are the only months that have 30 days.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* When the input month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `True`.
* When the input month is not one of the months with 30 days, the function returns `False`.
* When the input month is out of range (less than 1 or greater than 12), the function will still return a correct result, although the problem description does not explicitly specify what should happen in this case. However, since the function only checks for membership in the list `thirty_days_months`, it will correctly return `False` for any month number outside the range 1-12.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
