Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate. The problem statement asks to write a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 30 days by checking if the input month number is in the list `thirty_days_months`, which includes the months April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The annotated version of the code confirms that the input to the function is a valid month number between 1 and 12, and the function returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days and `False` otherwise. This behavior aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the function's ability to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The function's simple implementation and the annotations provided support the conclusion that the function is correct for all specified inputs and scenarios.

Final: **True**
