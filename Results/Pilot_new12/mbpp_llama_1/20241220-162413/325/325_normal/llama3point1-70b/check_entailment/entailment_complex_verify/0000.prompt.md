You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The problem statement describes the task as identifying months with 30 days, given that months are represented as numbers from 1 to 12. 

The function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 30 days by checking if the input month number is in the list `thirty_days_months`, which includes the months April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). These are the only months in the standard Gregorian calendar that have exactly 30 days.

Given the function's simple and accurate implementation, it correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For any input month number from 1 to 12, it will return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the function does not handle correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for all specified inputs and scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given month has 30 days, accepting an integer month between 1 and 12 as input, and returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November, and False otherwise, covering all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases, providing a clear boolean indication of the month's day count.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
