Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks whether it has 30 days or not. 

The problem description specifies that the input month number will be an integer between 1 and 12, which represents the months from January to December. The function correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) by checking if the input `month` is in the list `thirty_days_months`. 

The function returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days and `False` otherwise. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program works as intended and follows the problem description.

For example, if the input is 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), or 11 (November), the function will return `True`. For any other input between 1 and 12, the function will return `False`. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says for every potential case.
