To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides that `month` is an integer ranging from 1 to 12, and `thirty_days_months` is a list containing the months [4, 6, 9, 11], which are the months with 30 days in a year.

Given the code `return month in thirty_days_months`, this statement checks if the value of `month` is present in the list `thirty_days_months`.

Since `thirty_days_months` = [4, 6, 9, 11] and `month` can be any integer from 1 to 12, the program will return `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11 (because these months have 30 days). For all other values of `month` (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), the program will return `False`, indicating that the month either has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) or is February which can have 28 or 29 days.

Therefore, the return value depends on whether `month` matches any of the values in `thirty_days_months`.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), and False otherwise.**
