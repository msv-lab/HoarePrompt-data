The given code defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the months that have 30 days. The initial state is that `month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.

The code does not modify the value of `month`. It simply defines a new list `thirty_days_months`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12, `thirty_days_months` is a list containing the months [4, 6, 9, 11].
Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12, `thirty_days_months` is [4, 6, 9, 11]**
