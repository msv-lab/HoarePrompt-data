#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a given month has 30 days, accepting an integer month between 1 and 12 as input, and returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November, and False otherwise, covering all 12 months of the year without any exceptions or missing cases, providing a clear boolean indication of the month's day count.
