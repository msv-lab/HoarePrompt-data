To determine the output state, we need to understand what `cmath.phase(complex_num)` returns. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the phase (angle) of a complex number in radians.

Given that `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`, where `real` and `imag` are real numbers, the phase of `complex_num` can be calculated using the formula for the phase (or argument) of a complex number: `atan2(imag, real)`.

Therefore, the program returns the phase of the complex number `complex_num`, which is equivalent to the arctangent of `imag/real`, considering the quadrant that `real` and `imag` are in.

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num`, which is `atan2(imag, real)`**
