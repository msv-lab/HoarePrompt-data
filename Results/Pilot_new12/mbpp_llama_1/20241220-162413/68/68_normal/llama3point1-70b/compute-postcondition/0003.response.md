Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the corresponding complex number. The phase is calculated using the `atan2` function, which handles edge cases such as division by zero and returns a value in the range `-π` to `π`. The state of the program after it concludes is that the function returns a single value, the phase of the complex number, without modifying the input parameters `real` and `imag`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the input parameters are not real numbers, and it assumes that the input values are valid numbers. The function's return value will be a float representing the phase of the complex number in radians.**
