Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the corresponding complex number. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The program uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase of the complex number, which is equivalent to `atan2(imag, real)`. The `atan2` function handles edge cases such as division by zero and returns a value in the range `-π` to `π`. The program assumes that the input values are valid numbers, which is in line with the assumption stated in the problem.

There are no potential cases where the program does not follow the problem description, as it simply creates a complex number from the input real and imaginary parts and returns its phase. The program does not modify the input parameters and returns a single value, the phase of the complex number, as expected. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is **True**.
