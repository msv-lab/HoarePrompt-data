The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num`, which is equivalent to `atan2(imag, real)`. This is consistent with the expected behavior of the `cmath.phase` function.

The original assessment also provides a thorough breakdown of why the function seems to be correct, including the use of the `complex` function to create a complex number from the provided `real` and `imag` values, and the return of the calculated angle in radians.

Additionally, the original assessment provides several test cases to verify the correctness of the function, and all of these cases appear to produce the expected results.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I believe that the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Final: **True**
