You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the angle of a complex number. The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

Here's a breakdown of why the function seems to be correct:

1. The function uses the `complex` function to create a complex number from the provided `real` and `imag` values.
2. It then uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle of the complex number. This function is a standard way to calculate the angle of a complex number in Python.
3. The function returns the calculated angle, which is in radians.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can test it with some examples:

- A complex number with a positive real part and a positive imaginary part (e.g., `1 + 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 0.785 radians (or 45 degrees).
- A complex number with a negative real part and a positive imaginary part (e.g., `-1 + 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 2.356 radians (or 135 degrees).
- A complex number with a negative real part and a negative imaginary part (e.g., `-1 - 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 3.927 radians (or 225 degrees).
- A complex number with a positive real part and a negative imaginary part (e.g., `1 - 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 5.498 radians (or 315 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 1 (e.g., `0 + 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 1.570 radians (or 90 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of -1 (e.g., `0 - 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 4.712 radians (or 270 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of 0 (e.g., `1 + 0j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is 0 radians (or 0 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of -1 and an imaginary part of 0 (e.g., `-1 + 0j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 3.141 radians (or 180 degrees).

In all these cases, the function seems to return the correct angle of the complex number. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the corresponding complex number. The phase is calculated using the `atan2` function, which handles edge cases such as division by zero and returns a value in the range `-π` to `π`. The state of the program after it concludes is that the function returns a single value, the phase of the complex number, without modifying the input parameters `real` and `imag`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the input parameters are not real numbers, and it assumes that the input values are valid numbers. The function's return value will be a float representing the phase of the complex number in radians.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
