The original assessment concludes that the program is correct based on the problem description. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function.

Upon examining the annotated version of the code, it appears that the function indeed calculates the phase angle of the complex number correctly. The annotation indicates that the program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num`, which is equivalent to `atan2(imag, real)`. This is consistent with the expected behavior of the `cmath.phase` function.

The annotated version also points out that the function does not handle potential exceptions that may occur if the input parameters are not real numbers. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

The original assessment provides several examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program, including cases where the complex number has a positive real part, a negative real part, and a positive imaginary part. These examples show that the program behaves as expected in different scenarios.

Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number, and the annotations provide additional insight into the program's behavior without revealing any errors.

Final: **True**
