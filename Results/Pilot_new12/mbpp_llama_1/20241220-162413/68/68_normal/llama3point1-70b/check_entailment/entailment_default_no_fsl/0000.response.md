Correctness: **True**

The code provided meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number. 

The `cmath.phase` function, as mentioned in the output hints, handles edge cases such as division by zero and returns a value in the range `-π` to `π`. This aligns with the expected behavior for calculating the angle of a complex number.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error handling for non-real numbers does not affect the correctness of the code in this context. The function correctly returns the phase of the complex number in radians without modifying the input parameters.

Therefore, given the assumptions and the problem description, the code works correctly for every potential valid case, which means it follows the problem description without any deviation for all valid inputs.
