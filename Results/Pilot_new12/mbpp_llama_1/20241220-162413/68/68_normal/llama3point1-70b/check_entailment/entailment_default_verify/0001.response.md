Based on the provided problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. 

The problem description requires writing a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, and I agree with this assessment. The `cmath.phase` function indeed returns the phase angle of the complex number in radians, which is within the range (-pi, pi]. This is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

The output hints provide additional information about the code's functionality, but they do not contradict the original assessment. The hints mention that the function uses the `atan2` function internally to calculate the phase, which handles edge cases such as division by zero. However, the code actually uses the `cmath.phase` function, which is equivalent to using `atan2` for calculating the phase.

The output hints also mention that the function does not handle potential exceptions that may occur if the input parameters are not real numbers. However, the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, so this is not a concern in this case.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
