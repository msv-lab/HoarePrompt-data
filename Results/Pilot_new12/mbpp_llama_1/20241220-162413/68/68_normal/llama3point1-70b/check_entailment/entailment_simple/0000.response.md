Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to get the angle of a complex number as described in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two real numbers `real` and `imag` as input, which are the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
2. It creates a complex number `complex_num` using the `complex` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns a complex number with the given real and imaginary parts.
3. It then returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `complex_num` using the `cmath.phase` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the phase (angle in radians) of a complex number.
4. The `cmath.phase` function calculates the angle using the `atan2` function, which is a two-argument form of the arctangent function that returns the angle in radians in the range (-π, π].
5. The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, and the program correctly implements this by returning the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number.

Since the program correctly implements the function to get the angle of a complex number as described in the problem description, and assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program is correct.
