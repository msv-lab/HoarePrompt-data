Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function.

The program works correctly for all potential cases. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase angle of the complex number in radians, which is within the range (-pi, pi]. This is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For a complex number with a positive real part and no imaginary part, the phase angle should be 0. For example, `func_1(3, 0)` returns `0.0`, which is correct.
- For a complex number with a negative real part and no imaginary part, the phase angle should be pi. For example, `func_1(-3, 0)` returns `3.141592653589793`, which is correct.
- For a complex number with a positive imaginary part and no real part, the phase angle should be pi/2. For example, `func_1(0, 3)` returns `1.5707963267948966`, which is correct.

Since all these examples work as expected, and no potential case could be found where the program does not work correctly, the code can be considered correct for the given problem description.
