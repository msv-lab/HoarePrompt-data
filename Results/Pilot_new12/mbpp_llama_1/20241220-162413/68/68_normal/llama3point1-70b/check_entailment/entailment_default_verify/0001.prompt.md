You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function.

The program works correctly for all potential cases. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase angle of the complex number in radians, which is within the range (-pi, pi]. This is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For a complex number with a positive real part and no imaginary part, the phase angle should be 0. For example, `func_1(3, 0)` returns `0.0`, which is correct.
- For a complex number with a negative real part and no imaginary part, the phase angle should be pi. For example, `func_1(-3, 0)` returns `3.141592653589793`, which is correct.
- For a complex number with a positive imaginary part and no real part, the phase angle should be pi/2. For example, `func_1(0, 3)` returns `1.5707963267948966`, which is correct.

Since all these examples work as expected, and no potential case could be found where the program does not work correctly, the code can be considered correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the corresponding complex number. The phase is calculated using the `atan2` function, which handles edge cases such as division by zero and returns a value in the range `-π` to `π`. The state of the program after it concludes is that the function returns a single value, the phase of the complex number, without modifying the input parameters `real` and `imag`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the input parameters are not real numbers, and it assumes that the input values are valid numbers. The function's return value will be a float representing the phase of the complex number in radians.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
