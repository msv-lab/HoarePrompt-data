Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the angle of a complex number. The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

Here's a breakdown of why the function seems to be correct:

1. The function uses the `complex` function to create a complex number from the provided `real` and `imag` values.
2. It then uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle of the complex number. This function is a standard way to calculate the angle of a complex number in Python.
3. The function returns the calculated angle, which is in radians.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can test it with some examples:

- A complex number with a positive real part and a positive imaginary part (e.g., `1 + 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 0.785 radians (or 45 degrees).
- A complex number with a negative real part and a positive imaginary part (e.g., `-1 + 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 2.356 radians (or 135 degrees).
- A complex number with a negative real part and a negative imaginary part (e.g., `-1 - 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 3.927 radians (or 225 degrees).
- A complex number with a positive real part and a negative imaginary part (e.g., `1 - 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 5.498 radians (or 315 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 1 (e.g., `0 + 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 1.570 radians (or 90 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of -1 (e.g., `0 - 1j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 4.712 radians (or 270 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of 0 (e.g., `1 + 0j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is 0 radians (or 0 degrees).
- A complex number with a real part of -1 and an imaginary part of 0 (e.g., `-1 + 0j`): The function returns the correct angle, which is approximately 3.141 radians (or 180 degrees).

In all these cases, the function seems to return the correct angle of the complex number. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
