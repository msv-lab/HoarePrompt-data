Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, as input and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the corresponding complex number. The function uses the `cmath.phase` function, which is equivalent to the `atan2` function, to calculate the phase. This approach correctly handles edge cases such as division by zero and returns a value in the range `-π` to `π`. 

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function returns the phase of the complex number in radians without modifying the input parameters. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the input parameters are not real numbers, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not considered an issue.

The code correctly follows the problem description and does not have any apparent issues for any potential case. It will return the correct phase for any valid complex number, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
