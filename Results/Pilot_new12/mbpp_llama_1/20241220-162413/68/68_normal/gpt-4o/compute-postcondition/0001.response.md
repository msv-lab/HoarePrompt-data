The `cmath.phase()` function in Python returns the phase (angle) of a complex number. Given that `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*j`, where `real` and `imag` are numbers, the phase of `complex_number` can be calculated using the formula `atan2(imag, real)`, which is essentially what `cmath.phase()` does.

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag*j`, which is a value between -π and π representing the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number, where `real` and `imag` are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.**
