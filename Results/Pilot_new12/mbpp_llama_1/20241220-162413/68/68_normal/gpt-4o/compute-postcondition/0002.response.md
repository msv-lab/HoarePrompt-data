The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag*j`, which is a value between -π and π representing the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, real and imag, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these parameters.**
