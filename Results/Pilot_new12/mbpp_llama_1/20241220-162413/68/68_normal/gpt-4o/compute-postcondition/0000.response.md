To determine the output state, we must analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is that `real` and `imag` are numbers. The code creates a complex number using these two values.

Given the code:
```python
complex_number = complex(real, imag)
```
This line of code creates a new complex number where `real` is the real part and `imag` is the imaginary part.

The impact of this code is the creation of a new variable `complex_number` that holds a complex value constructed from `real` and `imag`. The values of `real` and `imag` themselves do not change.

Therefore, after executing this code, `real` and `imag` remain numbers, and a new variable `complex_number` is introduced, which is a complex number equal to `real + imag*j` (where `j` is the imaginary unit, satisfying `j^2 = -1`).

Output State: **`real` and `imag` are numbers, `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*j`.**
