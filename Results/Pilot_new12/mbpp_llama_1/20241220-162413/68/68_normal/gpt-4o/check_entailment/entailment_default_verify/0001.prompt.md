You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the angle of a complex number. It uses the `cmath.phase` function to achieve this, which returns the phase (angle) of the complex number. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various complex numbers. The `math.isclose` function is used with a relative tolerance of 0.001 to account for potential floating-point precision issues.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The `cmath.phase` function handles the calculation of the angle in radians, and it works correctly for complex numbers in all four quadrants.

The function also correctly handles special cases such as complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts. For example, `func_1(0, 1j)` returns approximately 1.5708, which is the correct angle in radians for the complex number 0 + 1j (or i).

In conclusion, based on the provided code and unit tests, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases. If there were any issues or missing logic, the unit tests would likely fail, or there would be noticeable discrepancies in the calculated angles. However, the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implements the required functionality, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two numerical parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these parameters, which is a value between -π and π radians. The function effectively calculates the angle from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the point (`real`, `imag`) in the complex plane, covering all possible cases, including but not limited to, positive, negative, and zero values for both real and imaginary parts, and handling the potential edge case where the complex number may be at or very close to the positive or negative real axis. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, as it only uses them to compute the phase of the corresponding complex number. Upon conclusion, the program state is such that it has returned the calculated phase, with no side effects on external state other than the return value itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
