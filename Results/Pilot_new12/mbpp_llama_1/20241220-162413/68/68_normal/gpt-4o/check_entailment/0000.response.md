Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `cmath.phase()` function from the `cmath` module to calculate the angle of a complex number. This function takes a complex number as input and returns its phase (angle) in radians. The phase of a complex number is defined as the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (or real axis) in the complex plane.

The `func_1()` function creates a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts and then passes this complex number to `cmath.phase()`. This correctly calculates the angle of the complex number.

The unit tests provided using `math.isclose()` confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The `math.isclose()` function is used to compare floating point numbers with a relative tolerance, which is necessary because floating point calculations can sometimes produce small rounding errors.

Since the `cmath.phase()` function is designed to handle all possible complex numbers (including zero), the program is expected to work correctly for all inputs. There are no obvious edge cases that would cause the function to fail. Even when the real part is zero, `cmath.phase()` returns the correct angle (π/2 or -π/2, depending on the sign of the imaginary part).

In conclusion, the provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description, and it should work as expected for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is True.
