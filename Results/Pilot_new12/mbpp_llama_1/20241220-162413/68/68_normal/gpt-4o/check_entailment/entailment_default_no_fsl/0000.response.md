Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the phase (angle) of a complex number formed by the real and imaginary parts provided as input parameters. The function utilizes the `cmath.phase` function from Python's standard library, which correctly computes the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the point (real, imag) in the complex plane.

The code effectively covers all possible cases, including positive, negative, and zero values for both real and imaginary parts. It handles the potential edge cases where the complex number may be at or very close to the positive or negative real axis without introducing any errors.

The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for specific cases, and the code does not contain any logic that would cause it to fail for other valid inputs. The function does not modify the input parameters and only uses them to compute the phase of the corresponding complex number, ensuring that it does not have any side effects on external state other than returning the calculated phase.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential issues or edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
