Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function to get the angle of a complex number, which is exactly what the `func_1` function does.

Here's why the program is correct:

- It uses the `cmath` module, which provides functions to handle complex numbers.
- The `func_1` function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
- It constructs a complex number using these parts with `complex(real, imag)`.
- The `cmath.phase()` function is then used to calculate the phase (angle) of this complex number. This function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The return value is a float in the range (-π, π].
- The unit tests (assert statements) verify that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, confirming that it correctly returns the angle of the complex numbers formed by those inputs.

Given that the problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number and the provided function does exactly that, the program is correct. It handles the task as specified, assuming valid inputs are provided, as stated in the constraints.
