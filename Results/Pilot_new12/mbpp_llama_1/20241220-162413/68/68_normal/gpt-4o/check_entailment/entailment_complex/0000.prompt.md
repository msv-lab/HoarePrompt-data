You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag*j`, which is a value between -π and π representing the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number, where `real` and `imag` are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two numerical parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these parameters, which is a value between -π and π radians. The function effectively calculates the angle from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the point (`real`, `imag`) in the complex plane, covering all possible cases, including but not limited to, positive, negative, and zero values for both real and imaginary parts, and handling the potential edge case where the complex number may be at or very close to the positive or negative real axis. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, as it only uses them to compute the phase of the corresponding complex number. Upon conclusion, the program state is such that it has returned the calculated phase, with no side effects on external state other than the return value itself.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
