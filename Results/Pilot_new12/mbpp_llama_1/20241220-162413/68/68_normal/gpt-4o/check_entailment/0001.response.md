Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the angle of a complex number. It uses the `cmath.phase` function to achieve this, which returns the phase (angle) of the complex number. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various complex numbers. The `math.isclose` function is used with a relative tolerance of 0.001 to account for potential floating-point precision issues.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The `cmath.phase` function handles the calculation of the angle in radians, and it works correctly for complex numbers in all four quadrants.

The function also correctly handles special cases such as complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts. For example, `func_1(0, 1j)` returns approximately 1.5708, which is the correct angle in radians for the complex number 0 + 1j (or i).

In conclusion, based on the provided code and unit tests, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases. If there were any issues or missing logic, the unit tests would likely fail, or there would be noticeable discrepancies in the calculated angles. However, the code appears to be well-structured and correctly implements the required functionality, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
