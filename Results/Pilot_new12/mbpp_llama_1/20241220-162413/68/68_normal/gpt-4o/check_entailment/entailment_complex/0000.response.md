Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numerical parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these parameters. The phase is calculated using the `cmath.phase` function, which returns a value between -π and π radians representing the angle from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including positive, negative, and zero values for both real and imaginary parts, and the potential edge case where the complex number may be at or very close to the positive or negative real axis. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, and only returns the calculated phase without any side effects on external state.

The assertions provided in the code also verify that the function behaves as expected for certain input values. For example, the assertion `math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)` checks that the function returns the expected value for the complex number `0 + 1j`, which is π/2 radians.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and correctly calculates the angle of a complex number for all valid input values.
