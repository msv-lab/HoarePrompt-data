#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `real + imag*j`, which is a value between -π and π representing the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number, where `real` and `imag` are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two numerical parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It returns the phase (angle) of the complex number formed by these parameters, which is a value between -π and π radians. The function effectively calculates the angle from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the point (`real`, `imag`) in the complex plane, covering all possible cases, including but not limited to, positive, negative, and zero values for both real and imaginary parts, and handling the potential edge case where the complex number may be at or very close to the positive or negative real axis. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`, as it only uses them to compute the phase of the corresponding complex number. Upon conclusion, the program state is such that it has returned the calculated phase, with no side effects on external state other than the return value itself.
