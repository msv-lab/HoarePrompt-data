Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. The problem asks to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. The program achieves this by using dynamic programming.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Handling the empty list**: The program correctly handles the case when the input list is empty. In this case, it returns 0, which is the expected result since there are no pairs of numbers to consider.

2. **Sorting the list**: The program sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that when checking for divisibility, the program always checks if a larger number is divisible by a smaller number. If the list were not sorted, the program might miss some valid pairs.

3. **Initializing the dynamic programming table**: The program initializes a list `dp` with the same length as the input list, where each element is set to 1. This is because the shortest sequence of divisible numbers is a single number, and the length of this sequence is 1.

4. **Filling the dynamic programming table**: The program then fills the `dp` table by iterating over the sorted list. For each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the program updates the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at the current position.

5. **Returning the result**: Finally, the program returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the input list.

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. It correctly calculates the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible, and it does so in a efficient manner using dynamic programming.
