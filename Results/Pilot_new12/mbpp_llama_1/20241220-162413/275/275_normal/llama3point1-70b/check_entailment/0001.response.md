Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, appears to correctly find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case when the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0 as expected.

2. **Sorting**: The input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. This step is crucial because it ensures that when checking for divisibility, a larger number will always come after a smaller number in the list. This property is necessary for the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the function.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: The function initializes a DP table `dp` of size equal to the length of `nums`, where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset ending at index `i`. Initially, all values in `dp` are set to 1, indicating that each number can form a divisible subset of size 1 on its own.

4. **Iterative Computation**: The function then iterates through `nums`, for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number `nums[i]` is divisible by a previous number `nums[j]`. If it is, and the divisible subset ending at `j` plus one (for the current number) is larger than the current largest divisible subset ending at `i`, it updates `dp[i]` accordingly.

5. **Result**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

Given the logic and the DP approach, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including edge cases like an empty list or lists containing a single element. It correctly identifies the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, adhering to the problem description.

Therefore, without being able to find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
