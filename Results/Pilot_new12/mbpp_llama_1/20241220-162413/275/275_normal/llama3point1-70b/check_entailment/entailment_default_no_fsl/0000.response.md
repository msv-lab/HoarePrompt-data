Correctness: **False**

The code provided attempts to solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible. However, the condition for divisibility is only checked in one direction, i.e., `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. This means that the code only checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, but not the other way around.

For the subset to have every pair divisible, both pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` and `(nums[j], nums[i])` should be divisible. The code does not ensure this condition, making it incorrect.

For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 8, 1]`, the code will return `3` because `[2, 4, 8]` is a sequence where each number is divisible by the previous one. However, it does not consider the fact that `1` cannot be part of any subset where every pair is divisible because `1` cannot be divisible by any other number except `1` itself, but other numbers cannot be divisible by `1` in the context of finding a subset where every pair of numbers is divisible.

To fix this, the code should check for both `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` and `nums[j] % nums[i] == 0`, or better, ensure that the smallest number in the subset is `1` and every other number is divisible by it, or find another approach that correctly implements the condition of every pair in the subset being divisible. 

This issue indicates that the code does not work correctly for every potential case, thus the correctness is **False**.
