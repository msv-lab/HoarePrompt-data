You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, appears to correctly find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case when the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0 as expected.

2. **Sorting**: The input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. This step is crucial because it ensures that when checking for divisibility, a larger number will always come after a smaller number in the list. This property is necessary for the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the function.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: The function initializes a DP table `dp` of size equal to the length of `nums`, where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset ending at index `i`. Initially, all values in `dp` are set to 1, indicating that each number can form a divisible subset of size 1 on its own.

4. **Iterative Computation**: The function then iterates through `nums`, for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number `nums[i]` is divisible by a previous number `nums[j]`. If it is, and the divisible subset ending at `j` plus one (for the current number) is larger than the current largest divisible subset ending at `i`, it updates `dp[i]` accordingly.

5. **Result**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

Given the logic and the DP approach, the function should work correctly for all possible inputs, including edge cases like an empty list or lists containing a single element. It correctly identifies the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, adhering to the problem description.

Therefore, without being able to find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is the length of `nums` minus 1 if `nums` has more than one element, and `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i` in `nums`, with `dp` being a list of 1s if `nums` has one or zero elements.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list. If the input list `nums` is empty, it returns 0. The function considers all possible sequences of divisible numbers and returns the maximum length found. The function's return value is an integer representing the length of the longest sequence, which is either the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list or 0 if the input list is empty. The function does not modify the original input list, but creates a sorted copy of it internally. The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list, a list with one element, and a list with multiple elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
