Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns 0.
2. It then sorts the input list in ascending order.
3. A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with 1s, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset ending at index `i`.
4. The function then iterates over the sorted list, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the DP array with the maximum size of the divisible subset.
5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

* Empty input list: Returns 0 as expected.
* Single-element input list: Returns 1 as expected.
* Multiple-element input list: Finds the largest divisible subset correctly.
* Input list with duplicate elements: Handles duplicates correctly by considering each duplicate element as a separate element in the subset.

I couldn't find any potential case where the code does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
