You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns 0.
2. It then sorts the input list in ascending order.
3. A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with 1s, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset ending at index `i`.
4. The function then iterates over the sorted list, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the DP array with the maximum size of the divisible subset.
5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

* Empty input list: Returns 0 as expected.
* Single-element input list: Returns 1 as expected.
* Multiple-element input list: Finds the largest divisible subset correctly.
* Input list with duplicate elements: Handles duplicates correctly by considering each duplicate element as a separate element in the subset.

I couldn't find any potential case where the code does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is the length of `nums` minus 1 if `nums` has more than one element, and `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i` in `nums`, with `dp` being a list of 1s if `nums` has one or zero elements.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list. If the input list `nums` is empty, it returns 0. The function considers all possible sequences of divisible numbers and returns the maximum length found. The function's return value is an integer representing the length of the longest sequence, which is either the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list or 0 if the input list is empty. The function does not modify the original input list, but creates a sorted copy of it internally. The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list, a list with one element, and a list with multiple elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
