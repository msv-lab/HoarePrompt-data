#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list is not empty

            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is the length of `nums` minus 1 if `nums` has more than one element, and `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i` in `nums`, with `dp` being a list of 1s if `nums` has one or zero elements.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list. If the input list `nums` is empty, it returns 0. The function considers all possible sequences of divisible numbers and returns the maximum length found. The function's return value is an integer representing the length of the longest sequence, which is either the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers in the sorted list or 0 if the input list is empty. The function does not modify the original input list, but creates a sorted copy of it internally. The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list, a list with one element, and a list with multiple elements.
