According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and `i` remains the same as the loop is iterating over the range of `i`. 
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`**
