Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is 1, `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`, and `j` will be 0. The current value of `i` is 1 and the current value of `j` is 0, `nums` at index `i` is a multiple of `nums` at index `j`, meaning the remainder when `nums` at index `i` is divided by `nums` at index `j` is 0**
