The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp` at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp` at index `j` plus 1. 

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where all elements are initially 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we can determine the impact of this code.

The initial value of `dp[i]` is 1 (since all elements of `dp` are initially 1), and the initial value of `dp[j]` is also 1. Given that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it means we have found a pair where the value at index `i` can potentially extend the sequence found up to index `j`.

Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(1, 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `max(1, 2)`, resulting in `dp[i]` being updated to 2.

The states of the other variables (`nums`, `i`, `j`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
