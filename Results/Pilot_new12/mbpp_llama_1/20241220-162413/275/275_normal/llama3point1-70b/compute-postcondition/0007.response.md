Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where all elements are 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums` at index `i` is a multiple of the current value of `nums` at index `j`, meaning `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`**
