According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute because the range starts from 1. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where all elements are 1. This ensures that the loop will execute if `nums` has at least 2 elements. So, for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where all elements are 1, `i` is 1**
