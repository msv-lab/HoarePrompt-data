The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, so `dp[2]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + 1`. 

The value of `nums` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements. The value of `i` is still 2 and the value of `j` is still 1. The list `dp` still has enough space for the new length of `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`, `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`**
