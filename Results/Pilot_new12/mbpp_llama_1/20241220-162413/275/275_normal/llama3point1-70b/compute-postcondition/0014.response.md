To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 0.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[2]` is 2 and all other elements are either 1 or 2 based on their initial divisibility conditions.

The code snippet is:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
Substituting the values of `i` and `j`:
```python
dp[3] = max(dp[3], dp[0] + 1)
```
Since `dp[2]` is 2 and all other elements are either 1 or 2, and considering `i` and `j`'s values:
- `dp[0]` can be either 1 or 2.
- `dp[3]` before the operation can also be either 1 or 2.

Now, let's evaluate `dp[3] = max(dp[3], dp[0] + 1)`:
- If `dp[0]` is 1, then `dp[0] + 1` = 2. Thus, `dp[3]` will be the maximum of its current value (either 1 or 2) and 2. If `dp[3]` was 1, it becomes 2; if it was 2, it remains 2.
- If `dp[0]` is 2, then `dp[0] + 1` = 3. Thus, `dp[3]` will be the maximum of its current value (either 1 or 2) and 3. Regardless of its previous value, `dp[3]` will become 3.

Considering these scenarios, the only variable that changes is `dp[3]`, which can become either 2 or 3 based on the value of `dp[0]`. The other elements of `dp`, `nums`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

The Output State is: 
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 0.
- `dp[2]` is 2.
- `dp[3]` is either 2 (if `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[3]` was initially 2) or 3 (if `dp[0]` is 2, or if `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[3]` was initially 1).
- All other elements of `dp` remain either 1 or 2 based on their initial divisibility conditions.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[2]` is 2, `dp[3]` is either 2 or 3, and other elements of `dp` are either 1 or 2.**
