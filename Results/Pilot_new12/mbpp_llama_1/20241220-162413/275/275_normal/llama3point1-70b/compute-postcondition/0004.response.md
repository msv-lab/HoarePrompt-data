The code `dp = [1] * len(nums)` creates a new list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element in `dp` is initialized to 1. This operation does not modify the `nums` list.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where all elements are 1**
