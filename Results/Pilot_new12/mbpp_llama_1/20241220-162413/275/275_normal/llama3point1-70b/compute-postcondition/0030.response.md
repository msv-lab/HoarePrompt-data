To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means it depends on the value of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because `range(i)` needs to have at least one value to iterate over.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i` in `nums` and has enough space for the new length of `nums`.

Since `i` is already 1, which is greater than 0, the condition for the loop to execute is already met. However, we should also consider the context of `j` in the loop. `j` will take values from 0 up to `i-1`. Since `i` is 1, `j` will only be 0 during the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is 1, `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`, and `j` will be 0**
