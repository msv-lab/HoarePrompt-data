Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp` is a list where `dp[2]` is 2 and all other elements are either 1 or 2 based on their initial divisibility conditions except for `dp[2]` which is now definitely 2, regardless of whether `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[0]` or not.***
