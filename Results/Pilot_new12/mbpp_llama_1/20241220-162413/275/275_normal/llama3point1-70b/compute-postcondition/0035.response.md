`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, `dp[2]` becomes the maximum of its current value `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + 1`, and `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`**
