The given code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, and `j` is 2, we can infer that `i` and `j` are indices related to the list `nums` and the list `dp` respectively.

The value of `dp[i]` is updated, and since `dp` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list that can hold values. 

The states of `nums` and `j` are not affected by the code. 

The value of `i` is also not changed by the code, as it is used as an index.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, which is `dp[2] + 1`.**
