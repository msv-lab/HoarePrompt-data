Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list where `dp[i-1]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i-1` in `nums`, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of the current value of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
