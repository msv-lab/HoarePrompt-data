To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will execute again. The loop is controlled by the variable `j` and its relation to `i`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`. 

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and considering the loop `for j in range(i):`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented because `j` will range from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration requires `i` to be at least 2 to allow `j` to take on the value of 0 and then 1 in the subsequent iterations.

Therefore, considering the state adjustments:

- `nums` must still be a sorted list of integers in ascending order but now must have at least 5 elements to accommodate the increased `i` and the logic dependent on `nums` and its indexing.
- `i` needs to be incremented to 2 to ensure the loop can execute again with `j` taking on values from 0 to 1.
- `j` will reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop (not shown but implied by the context of the for loop given), so `j` starts at 0 when `i` is 2.
- `dp` must have enough space for the new length of `nums`, implying it should accommodate at least 5 elements if `nums` has 5 elements.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`**
