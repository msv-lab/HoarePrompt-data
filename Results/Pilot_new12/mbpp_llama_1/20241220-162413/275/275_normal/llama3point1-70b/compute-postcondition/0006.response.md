According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute because `range(i)` will have at least one element. Given that `i` is 1 before the loop starts, the loop will execute once with `j` being 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where all elements are 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
