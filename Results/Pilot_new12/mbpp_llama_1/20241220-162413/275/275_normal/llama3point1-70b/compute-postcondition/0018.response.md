According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is the length of `nums` and `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, we can conclude that `i` is at least 3. Before the loop starts, `i` is the length of `nums`, `nums` has at least 3 elements, and `dp` is a list where `dp[i-1]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i-1` in `nums`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be initialized to 0.
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list where `dp[i-1]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i-1` in `nums`, `j` is 0**
