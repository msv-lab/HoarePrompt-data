To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is the length of `nums`.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i` in `nums`.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, len(nums)):`. This means the loop will iterate over the indices of `nums` starting from 1 up to, but not including, the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` equals the length of `nums`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `nums` since the loop condition checks if `i` is in the range from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`.
- Since `i` is initially set to the length of `nums` and needs to be less than the length of `nums` for the next iteration, the length of `nums` must increase by at least 1 to allow `i` to be within the loop's range.

Adjusting states for the next iteration:
- `nums` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again because `i` must be less than the length of `nums`, and since `i` starts at 1, having at least 4 elements ensures that `i` can take on values up to the second last index of `nums`.
- `i` should be 1 for the next iteration to start because the loop starts from 1, but to continue the iteration process, `i` needs to be the next index after the previous iteration ended, which was at the end of the list. However, based on the loop's definition, `i` will reset to the starting value of the range (1) after each full iteration over the list. Since we are considering the state for the loop to execute "one more time" after the previous iteration ended, we actually consider the increase in `nums` length and the conditions for `i` and `dp` to make sense in this new iteration.
- `dp` needs to accommodate the increased length of `nums`, meaning it must have enough space to hold the lengths of the longest sequences of divisible numbers ending at each position in the new, longer `nums` list.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is 1 (as the loop restarts from the beginning), and `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisible numbers ending at position `i` in `nums` and has enough space for the new length of `nums`.**
