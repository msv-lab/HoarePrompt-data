Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[2]` is 2, and other elements of `dp` are either 1 or 2; if `nums[3]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[3]` is either 2 or 3, otherwise, the state of `dp[3]` remains unchanged as either 1 or 2.**
