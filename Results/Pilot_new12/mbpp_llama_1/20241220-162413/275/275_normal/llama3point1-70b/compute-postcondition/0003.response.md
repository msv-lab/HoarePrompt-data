The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list of integers `nums` in ascending order. The previous value of `nums` was a list of integers, and the list was not empty. After sorting, the list `nums` is still not empty and still contains integers, but the order of the integers has changed to ascending order. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty**
