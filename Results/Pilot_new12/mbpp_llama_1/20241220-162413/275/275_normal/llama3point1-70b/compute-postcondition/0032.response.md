The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums` at index `i` is a multiple of `nums` at index `j`, this means that the value of `dp[i]` is potentially increased by 1, depending on the current values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp` has enough space for the new length of `nums`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.
