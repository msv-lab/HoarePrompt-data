To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list where if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + 1`.
- `j` is 0.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`. This means the loop will iterate over the indices of the list `nums`, from 0 up to but not including `i`.

Since `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

The other variables' states do not directly depend on the loop counter `j` but on the condition that allows the loop to continue, which is `j` being less than `i`. Since `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i`, and since `j` is now 1, this condition is still met if `i` remains at least 3 or more.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration would consider `j` incremented by 1, without necessarily changing the conditions or values of `nums`, `i`, or `dp`, except that `dp`'s calculation depends on the relationship between `nums` elements and `j`, but that's part of the loop body, not the condition for the loop to start the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `dp` is a list where its values depend on the divisibility of `nums` elements by `nums[0]`, and `j` is 1**
