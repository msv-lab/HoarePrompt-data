To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 1, otherwise all elements in `dp` are 1.

Loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment and still be within the range of `i`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `i` is 1, the next value of `j` would be 1 if `i` were greater than 1. However, `i` itself does not change within this loop; it's `j` that iterates from 0 up to but not including `i`.

Thus, for the loop to potentially execute one more time, `i` must be greater than its current value (1) because `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. If `i` were to increase to 2, then `j` could be 0 or 1 during the next iterations of the outer loop (not shown in this snippet), allowing the loop to execute again.

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to potentially execute one more time:
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` must increase to 2 to allow `j` to range over more than one value.
- `j` would reset to 0 at the start of the next iteration of the outer loop (assuming there is one), given the structure of the provided loop.
- `dp` would need to be recalculated based on the new values of `i` and `j`, following the same rules as before.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 1, otherwise all elements in `dp` are 1**
