To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list where its values depend on the divisibility of `nums` elements by `nums[0]`.
- `j` is 1.

Given Code:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

Analyzing the Code:
- This line of code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- Since `j` is 1, `dp[j]` refers to the second element of the `dp` list (`dp[1]`).
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the value of `dp[1]` plus one.

Considering the initial state and the effect of the code:
- `nums` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the code.
- `i` remains unchanged because it's the length of `nums`, and `nums` hasn't changed.
- `dp` is updated at index `i`, with its new value being the maximum between the old value at `dp[i]` and `dp[1] + 1`.
- `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`, and `j` is 1**
