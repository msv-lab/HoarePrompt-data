According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `j` should be 2. The state of `nums` and `i` remains the same. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is the length of `nums` and is at least 3, `j` is 2**
