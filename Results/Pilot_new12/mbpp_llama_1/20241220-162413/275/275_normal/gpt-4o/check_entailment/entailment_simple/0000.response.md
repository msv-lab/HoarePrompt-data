Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description asks for because it checks if the current number is divisible by any of the previous numbers, not if every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible.

The problem statement requires that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible, but the program only checks if each number is divisible by any of the previous numbers. This is not sufficient to ensure that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible.

For example, if the input is [2, 4, 6, 8], the program will return 4, but the subset [2, 4, 6, 8] does not satisfy the condition that every pair of numbers is divisible (e.g., 2 and 6 are not divisible, and neither are 4 and 8).

To fix this, the program would need to check all possible subsets of the input list and verify that every pair of numbers in each subset is divisible. The current implementation does not do this, so it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    max_size = 0
    for i in range(1 << len(nums)):
        subset = [nums[j] for j in range(len(nums)) if (i & (1 << j))]
        if subset:
            valid = True
            for j in range(len(subset)):
                for k in range(j + 1, len(subset)):
                    if subset[j] % subset[k]!= 0 and subset[k] % subset[j]!= 0:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                max_size = max(max_size, len(subset))

    return max_size
```

This version of the function generates all possible subsets of the input list and checks each subset to see if every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. If it finds a subset that meets this condition, it updates the maximum size if the size of this subset is larger than the current maximum size.
