Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the length of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible. The function first sorts the input list and then uses dynamic programming to find the longest sequence of divisors. 

The function handles edge cases such as an empty input list, lists containing a single element, and cases where the longest sequence of divisors has a length of 1. It also correctly calculates the length of the longest sequence of divisors for the given examples.

The problem description is met as the code finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible, and it does this for every potential case. 

The code is well-structured and readable. The dynamic programming approach is suitable for this problem and the function is correctly implemented.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the cases that the code handles correctly. 

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
