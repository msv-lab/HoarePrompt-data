Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct in finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct since there are no pairs to consider.

2. The function then sorts the input list `nums` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that when checking for divisibility, we are always checking if a larger number is divisible by a smaller number, which is a prerequisite for the divisibility condition.

3. The function uses dynamic programming to build up a solution. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset that can be formed using the numbers up to `nums[i]`. Initially, `dp[i]` is set to 1 for all `i`, since a single number is always a valid subset.

4. The function then iterates over each number in the sorted list. For each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This is because we have found a larger subset that can be formed by adding `nums[i]` to the subset represented by `dp[j]`.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset that satisfies the divisibility condition.

The provided unit tests suggest that the function works correctly for various inputs. After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
