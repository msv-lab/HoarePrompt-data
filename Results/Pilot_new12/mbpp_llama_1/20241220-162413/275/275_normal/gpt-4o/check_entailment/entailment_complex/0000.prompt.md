You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of integers, and the list nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, considering all previous elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list `nums`, where each number in the sequence is a divisor of the next number, and `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. The sequence of divisors is defined as a series of numbers where each number is a divisor of the next number in the sequence. The function sorts the input list in ascending order before determining the longest sequence of divisors. The function covers edge cases such as an empty input list and lists containing a single element. It also handles cases where the longest sequence of divisors has a length of 1, meaning that there are no divisors for any number in the list except for itself. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the input list has been sorted in ascending order, and the function returns either 0 (if the input list was empty) or the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
