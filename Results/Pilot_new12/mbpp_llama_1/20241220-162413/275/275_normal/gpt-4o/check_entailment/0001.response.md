Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function appears to be correct based on the problem description. It attempts to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns 0.
2. It then sorts the input list in ascending order.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` with all elements set to 1, assuming each number can form a subset of size 1 on its own.
4. The function iterates through the sorted list and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the larger number is divisible by the smaller number.
5. If a pair is divisible, it updates the DP table by setting the value at the larger number's index to the maximum of its current value and the value at the smaller number's index plus 1.
6. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the DP table, which represents the size of the largest subset of divisible numbers.

The given unit tests seem to be working correctly with the function. The function is also well-structured and handles edge cases properly.

No specific case has been found where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the code appears to be correct for finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.
