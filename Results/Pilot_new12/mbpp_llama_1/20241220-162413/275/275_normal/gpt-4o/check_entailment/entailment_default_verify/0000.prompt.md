You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct in finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct since there are no pairs to consider.

2. The function then sorts the input list `nums` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that when checking for divisibility, we are always checking if a larger number is divisible by a smaller number, which is a prerequisite for the divisibility condition.

3. The function uses dynamic programming to build up a solution. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset that can be formed using the numbers up to `nums[i]`. Initially, `dp[i]` is set to 1 for all `i`, since a single number is always a valid subset.

4. The function then iterates over each number in the sorted list. For each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This is because we have found a larger subset that can be formed by adding `nums[i]` to the subset represented by `dp[j]`.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset that satisfies the divisibility condition.

The provided unit tests suggest that the function works correctly for various inputs. After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. The sequence of divisors is defined as a series of numbers where each number is a divisor of the next number in the sequence. The function sorts the input list in ascending order before determining the longest sequence of divisors. The function covers edge cases such as an empty input list and lists containing a single element. It also handles cases where the longest sequence of divisors has a length of 1, meaning that there are no divisors for any number in the list except for itself. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the input list has been sorted in ascending order, and the function returns either 0 (if the input list was empty) or the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
