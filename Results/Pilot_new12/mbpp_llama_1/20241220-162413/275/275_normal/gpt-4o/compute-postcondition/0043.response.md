The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the functionality can be described in two cases: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: If the conditions for a sequence of divisors are met, the function returns the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list `nums`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either 0 or the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in `nums` where each number in the sequence is a divisor of the next number.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns either 0 or the length of the longest sequence of divisors.**
