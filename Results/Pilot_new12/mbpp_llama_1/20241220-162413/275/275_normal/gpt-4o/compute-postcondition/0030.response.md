According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute because `j` will range from 0 to `i-1`. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1, which means `i` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` will be in the range from 0 to `i-1`. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` will be in the range from 0 to `i-1`**
