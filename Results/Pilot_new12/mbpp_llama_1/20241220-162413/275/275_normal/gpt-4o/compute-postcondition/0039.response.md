Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` for any `j` where `nums[j]` is a divisor of `nums[i]`, and `i` is greater than its previous value, if `nums[i]` is divisible by any `nums[j]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
