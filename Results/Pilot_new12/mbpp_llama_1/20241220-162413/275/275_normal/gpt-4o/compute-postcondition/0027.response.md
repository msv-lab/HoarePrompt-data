Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`.***
