To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
- `i` is greater than 1.
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for any `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means `j` will iterate over all indices from 0 to `i-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to start with a new iteration where `j` would take the value of `i`, but since the loop only goes up to `i-1`, we consider the conditions under which the outer loop (not shown) would increment `i` and thus allow `j` to potentially reach the next index in a subsequent iteration.

Given that `i` is greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again (considering an outer loop increments `i`), `i` should be incremented by 1. This would mean `i` is now greater than its previous value, and since `j` iterates up to `i-1`, the new value of `i` allows `j` to reach one more index in `nums` in the next iteration.

However, the description doesn't directly mention how `nums` and `dp` are updated outside the loop, but since `i` is moving forward, we assume `nums` remains the same list, and `dp` gets updated based on the new `i`. The condition for `dp[i]` to be updated implies that `nums[i]` and its divisibility by previous `nums[j]` are key, but without explicit loop body details, we focus on the loop control variable `i` and its impact.

Therefore, adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `nums` remains a list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` is updated based on the new `i`, but its exact update depends on the loop body which isn't provided. However, `dp` continues to represent the lengths of the longest sequences of divisors for the corresponding `nums` indices.
- `i` is incremented by 1, as it's the loop control variable that moves forward.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` after considering divisibility up to the new `i`, `i` is greater than its previous value**
