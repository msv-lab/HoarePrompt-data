The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` can be potentially increased by 1 if the sequence ending at `nums[j]` is used as a prefix. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and `dp[i]` is now max(previous `dp[i]`, `dp[j]` + 1), `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
