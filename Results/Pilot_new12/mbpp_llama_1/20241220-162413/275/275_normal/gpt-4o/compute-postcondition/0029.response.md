According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at the end of the previous iteration, so for the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` considering all previous elements in `nums`, `i` is increased by 1**
