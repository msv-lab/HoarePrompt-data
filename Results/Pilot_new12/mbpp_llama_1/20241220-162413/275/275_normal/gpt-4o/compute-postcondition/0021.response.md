Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j]` plus 1**
