`dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The value of `dp[i]` is now at least as large as `dp[j] + 1` if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the previous value of `dp[i]`. The states of the other variables, including `nums`, `i`, and `j`, are not affected. 

The value of `dp[i]` will be `dp[j] + 1` if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the previous value of `dp[i]`. 

`nums` is still a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
