According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the loop counter `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. The state of `nums` and `dp` remains the same, as the loop only depends on the indices `i` and `j`. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
