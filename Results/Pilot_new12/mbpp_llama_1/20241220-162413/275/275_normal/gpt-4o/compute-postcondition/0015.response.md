Postcondition: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length `len(nums)`, `i` is greater than 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains the same as its previous value, which is at least 1 for all `i`.**
