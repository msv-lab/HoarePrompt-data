Postcondition: ***`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`), `i` is greater than 1. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains the same as its previous value, which is at least 1 for all `i`.***
