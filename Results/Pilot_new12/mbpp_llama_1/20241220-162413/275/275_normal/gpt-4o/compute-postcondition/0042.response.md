To determine the output state, let's break down the information provided and the impact of the code on the program.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, considering all previous elements in `nums`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code `return max(dp)` returns the maximum value from the list `dp`.
   - This maximum value represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list `nums` up to any point.

3. **Previous Values and Calculations**:
   - Since `dp` contains lengths of the longest sequences of divisors for each element in `nums`, and `nums` is in ascending order, we can infer that each element in `dp` is calculated based on the divisibility relationships between elements in `nums`.
   - The maximum value in `dp` therefore represents the longest chain of divisors that can be formed using the elements of `nums`.

4. **Output State Calculation**:
   - Given that `dp` stores the lengths of the longest sequences of divisors for each element in `nums`, the `max(dp)` will return the longest sequence length found.
   - This returned value is essentially the length of the longest sequence of numbers in `nums` where each number is a divisor of the next number in the sequence.

Therefore, considering the provided initial state and the code's impact, the output state is described as follows:

Output State: **The program returns the length of the longest sequence of divisors found in the list `nums`, where each number in the sequence is a divisor of the next number, and `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order.**
