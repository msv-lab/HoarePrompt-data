According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`), `i` is greater than 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains the same as its previous value, which is at least 1 for all `i`.**
