To calculate the result, we consider the initial state and how the given code snippet affects it. 

The initial state provides that:
- `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` after considering divisibility up to the new `i`.
- `i` is greater than its previous value.

The code snippet is:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
This line of code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus one. This implies that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` could potentially be extended by one if the sequence ending at `nums[j]` is longer or equally long.

However, the given code snippet does not specify how `j` is determined. In a typical scenario involving sequences of divisors, `j` would likely be an index such that `nums[j]` is a divisor of `nums[i]`, and the update would reflect the potential extension of a divisor sequence.

Given the information, we can infer that the update to `dp[i]` is based on the existence of a divisor sequence ending at some previous index `j` that could be extended to `i` if `nums[j]` is a divisor of `nums[i]`.

The output state, therefore, considering that `dp[i]` has been updated based on the maximum length of a divisor sequence ending at previous indices plus one (if applicable), and considering that `nums` remains unchanged as it's just a list of integers in ascending order, is:

`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp[i]` now holds the maximum length between its previous value and the potential extension of a divisor sequence from any previous `j` where `nums[j]` is a divisor of `nums[i]`, and `i` remains greater than its previous value.

Since `dp[i]`'s update directly depends on the existence and lengths of divisor sequences up to the current `i`, and given that `j`'s determination isn't explicitly provided, we understand that `dp[i]` could be equal to its previous value if no such `j` exists, or `dp[j] + 1` if a divisor relationship allows for sequence extension.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` for any `j` where `nums[j]` is a divisor of `nums[i]`, and `i` is greater than its previous value.**
