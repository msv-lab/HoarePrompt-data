According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is in the range from 0 to `i-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so that `j` can be in the range from 0 to the new `i-1`. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` will be in the range from 0 to the new `i-1`, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1**
