To calculate the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

From this code, we can see that the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. This means that `dp[i]` will store the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

The output state after the loop executes a few times shows that `dp[i]` is updated based on the divisibility of `nums[i]` by `nums[j]`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list. The `dp` list will contain the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at each `nums[i]`.

If the `nums` list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the `dp` list will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` considering all previous elements in `nums`. If `nums` is empty, `dp` remains unchanged.**
