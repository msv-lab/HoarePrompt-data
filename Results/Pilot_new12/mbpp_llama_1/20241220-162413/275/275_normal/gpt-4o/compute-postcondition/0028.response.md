To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
This loop iterates over the range of `i`, which is the index of the current element in the `nums` list. For each iteration, it checks if the current element `nums[i]` is divisible by the element at index `j` (`nums[j]`). If it is, it updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus 1.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can see that:

* `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously.
* `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.
* `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` takes on values from 0 to `i-1`.

After all iterations have finished, we can conclude that:

* `nums` remains a list of integers in ascending order.
* `dp` is updated to reflect the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at each `nums[i]`.
* `i` has taken on all values from 1 to the length of `nums` minus 1 (since the loop iterates over `range(i)`).
* `j` has taken on all values from 0 to `i-1` for each `i`.
* If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `i` is 0), `dp[0]` remains unchanged, and `nums` remains a list of integers in ascending order with at least one element.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` considering all previous elements in `nums`.**
