The code initializes a list `dp` with the same length as the list `nums`, where each element in `dp` is set to 1. 

The initial state is that `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order. After executing the code, the state of `nums` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify `nums`. However, a new variable `dp` is introduced, which is a list of the same length as `nums`, with all elements set to 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`) with all elements equal to 1**
