The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This means that if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current value of `dp[i]`, then `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise it will remain the same.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length `len(nums)`, `i` is greater than 2, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains the same as its previous value, which is at least 1 for all `i`. 

After executing the code, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be at least `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and remains the same otherwise. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length `len(nums)`, `i` is greater than 2, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, and is at least 1 for all `i`.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length `len(nums)`, `i` is greater than 2, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, and is at least 1 for all `i`.**
