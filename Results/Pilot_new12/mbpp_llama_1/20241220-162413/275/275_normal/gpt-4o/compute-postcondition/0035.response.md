The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is in the range from 0 to `i-1` and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. This means that `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[j] + 1` if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` will be in the range from 0 to the new `i-1`.**
