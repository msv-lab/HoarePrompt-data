The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (1) and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp[i]` is initially 1 and `dp[j]` is also 1, `dp[i]` becomes 2 if `dp[j]` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Given that `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order and `i` is greater than 0, and considering that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, this means `nums[j]` must be a factor of `nums[i]`. This implies that `j` must be less than `i` because `nums` is in ascending order.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`) with `dp[i]` equal to 2 and all other elements equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`) with `dp[i]` equal to `dp[j] + 1` and all other elements equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0**
