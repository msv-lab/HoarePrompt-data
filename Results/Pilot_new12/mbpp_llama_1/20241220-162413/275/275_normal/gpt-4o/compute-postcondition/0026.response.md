The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

Given that `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2, 

`dp[i]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`. The values of `nums`, `j`, and the previous values of `dp` (except for `dp[i]`) are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + 1`, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
