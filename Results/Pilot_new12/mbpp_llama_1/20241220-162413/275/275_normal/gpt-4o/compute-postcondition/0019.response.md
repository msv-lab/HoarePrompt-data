Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has been updated accordingly, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder**
