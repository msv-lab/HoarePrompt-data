The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list of integers `nums` in ascending order. The list `nums` is not empty, so it contains at least one integer. 

After sorting, the list `nums` still contains the same integers, but they are now in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **nums is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order**
