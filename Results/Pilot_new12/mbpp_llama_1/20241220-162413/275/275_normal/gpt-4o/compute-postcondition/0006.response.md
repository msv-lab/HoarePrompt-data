According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0, because the range function will generate numbers from 0 up to but not including `i`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which means the loop will not execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0. The list `nums` and `dp` do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`) with all elements equal to 1, `i` must be greater than 0**
