The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp[i]` is initially equal to `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and 1 otherwise, this update will ensure that `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1` whenever `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged if its current value is greater than `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise it gets updated to `dp[j] + 1`. However, since `dp[i]` initially equals 1 when `nums[i]` is not divisible by any `nums[j]`, and `dp[j]` is at least 1 for any `j`, `dp[j] + 1` will be at least 2, thus `dp[i]` will get updated if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` and `dp[i]` was 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`), `i` is greater than 1, and `dp[i]` is equal to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j`, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is at least `dp[j] + 1`.**
