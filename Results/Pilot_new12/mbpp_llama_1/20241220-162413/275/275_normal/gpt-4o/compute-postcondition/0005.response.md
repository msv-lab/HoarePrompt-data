According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, it is already consistent with the state of `nums`. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order and `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`) with all elements equal to 1. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 1 element and `i` should be initialized to 0.
State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`) with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 0**
