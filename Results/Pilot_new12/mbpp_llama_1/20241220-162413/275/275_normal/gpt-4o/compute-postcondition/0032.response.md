The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `dp[i]` is updated based on `dp[j]`, its new value will be at least as large as its previous value, and potentially larger if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current `dp[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` will be in the range from 0 to `i-1`, and `dp[i]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` because `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` will be in the range from 0 to `i-1`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
