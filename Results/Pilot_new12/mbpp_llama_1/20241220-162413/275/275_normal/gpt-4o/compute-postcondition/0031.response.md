Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` will be in the range from 0 to `i-1`. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, meaning `nums[i]` can be divided by `nums[j]` without leaving a remainder.**
