According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Since `nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order and `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`), `i` must be less than len(`nums`) for the loop to execute again. The conditions on `nums` and `dp` remain unchanged.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers in ascending order, `dp` is a list of length len(`nums`), `i` is greater than 1, and if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged with all elements equal to 1**
