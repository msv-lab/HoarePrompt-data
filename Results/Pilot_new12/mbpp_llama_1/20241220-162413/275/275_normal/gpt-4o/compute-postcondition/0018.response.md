According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has been updated accordingly, and `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1` if we were to add an element to `nums` and consider the iteration before the last one. However, since we are looking at the end state and forward, `i` must be less than the new length of `nums` for any subsequent iterations to be possible, but in the context of the loop, `i` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. So, for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` will be initialized to 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has been updated accordingly, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
