To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1` in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `i` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` would be 2. Additionally, since the loop condition is `j` in `range(i)`, for `j` to be 2, `i` must be greater than 2 to include 2 in the range.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least one more element than previously, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
