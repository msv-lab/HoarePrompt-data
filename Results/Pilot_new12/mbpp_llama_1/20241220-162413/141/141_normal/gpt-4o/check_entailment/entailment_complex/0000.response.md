Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description because it accurately checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. The program first converts the integer into a string representation (`digit_str = str(n)`).
2. It then initializes an empty dictionary (`frequency = {}`) to store the frequency of each digit.
3. The program iterates through each character (digit) in the string representation and updates the frequency dictionary accordingly.
4. After counting the frequency of each digit, the program iterates through the dictionary and checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself (`if count > int(digit)`).
5. If any digit count exceeds its digit value, the program immediately returns `False`.
6. If the program finishes checking all digits without finding any count that exceeds its digit value, it returns `True`.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input integer is 0, in which case the string representation will be "0" and the frequency dictionary will be {"0": 1}, and the program will correctly return `True` because 1 is less than or equal to 0 is not true, however since 0 is an integer and int(0) is 0 then count(0) = 1 > 0 is False so return False which is correct.

The program's logic and implementation accurately follow the problem description, ensuring that it behaves as expected for all potential cases. The program assumes that the input will be a non-negative integer, as specified in the problem description, and handles this case correctly. 

However it does not check whether the number is negative and in such a case it simply does not handle this scenario, which is actually correct according to the rules defined at the end of the question since we assume that input will always be valid. But the program does what the problem description says and checks each digit in the integer.
