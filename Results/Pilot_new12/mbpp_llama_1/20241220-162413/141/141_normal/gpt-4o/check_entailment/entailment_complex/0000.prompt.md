You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1234) == True
assert func_1(51241) == False
assert func_1(321) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, if `digit_str` is not empty, then `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and each value is the count of that digit in `digit_str`; otherwise, `frequency` is an empty dictionary.
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of the original value of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and each value is the count of that digit in `digit_str`, and for each key-value pair in `frequency`, the value (count) is less than or equal to the integer value of the key (digit), or the function has returned False.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input, converts it into a string representation, counts the frequency of each digit in the string, and returns a boolean value indicating whether all digit counts are less than or equal to their respective digit values. If any digit count exceeds its digit value, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all digits. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string representation (i.e., when `n` is 0), in which case `frequency` will be an empty dictionary and the function will return `True`. The function does not modify the input `n` and does not perform any actions other than the described digit frequency checks.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
