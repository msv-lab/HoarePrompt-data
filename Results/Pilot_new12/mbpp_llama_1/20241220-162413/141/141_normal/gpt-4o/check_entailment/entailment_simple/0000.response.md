Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately implements the problem description. It checks whether the frequency of each digit in the given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Integer to String Conversion**: The function converts the input integer `n` to a string `digit_str`. This allows for the iteration over each digit in the integer.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Creation**: It then creates a dictionary `frequency` where the keys are the unique digits from the string representation of the integer, and the values are the counts of each digit. This is achieved by iterating over each character (digit) in the string, incrementing its count in the dictionary if it already exists, or adding it to the dictionary with a count of 1 if it doesn't.

3. **Frequency Validation**: After creating the frequency dictionary, the function iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary. For each pair, it checks if the count (value) is greater than the integer value of the digit (key). If such a condition is found, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the frequency of at least one digit exceeds the digit itself.

4. **Return True for Valid Cases**: If the function completes the validation without finding any digit whose frequency exceeds its value, it returns `True`. This indicates that the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself, as required by the problem description.

The function correctly handles the problem description's requirements for every potential case, assuming valid input (non-negative integers) as stated. It accurately checks the condition for each digit in the input integer, ensuring that the frequency of each digit does not exceed its value. Therefore, the correctness of the function is verified as true.
