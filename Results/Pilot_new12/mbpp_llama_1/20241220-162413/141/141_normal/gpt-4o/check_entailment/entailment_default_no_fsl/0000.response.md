Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer as input, converts it to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. If any digit count exceeds its digit value, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all digits.

The code handles edge cases such as an empty string representation (i.e., when `n` is 0), in which case `frequency` will be an empty dictionary and the function will return `True`. This is because the empty dictionary satisfies the condition that all digit counts (which are all zero) are less than or equal to their respective digit values.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code. For example, `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself (1 appears once, 2 appears once, 3 appears once, and 4 appears once). On the other hand, `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the frequency of the digit 1 exceeds its digit value (1 appears twice). 

The code assumes that the input will be a non-negative integer, which is in line with the problem description. It does not handle the case where the input is a negative integer or a non-integer, but this is allowed since we assume that the user will always provide a valid input. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the correctness of the code is **True**.
