Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

Here's why:

1. The function converts the integer into a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It then uses a dictionary `frequency` to count the occurrences of each digit in the string.
3. Finally, it checks for each digit in the `frequency` dictionary if its count is greater than the digit itself. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all digits without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This approach correctly implements the problem description, and the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) validate its correctness for the given cases. Additionally, the function does not contain any obvious edge cases that could cause it to fail, such as negative integers or non-integer inputs, which are not mentioned in the problem description.

The code is simple, readable, and well-structured, making it easy to understand and verify its correctness. Since the function behaves as expected for all the provided test cases and there are no obvious edge cases that could cause it to fail, we can conclude that the program is correct.
