The code converts the integer `n` to a string and assigns it to the variable `digit_str`. 

The value of `n` is still a non-negative integer. 
`digit_str` is assigned the string representation of `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`**
