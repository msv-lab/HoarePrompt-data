To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`
- `frequency` is an empty dictionary

The loop statement is: `for digit in digit_str:`

For this loop to execute, `digit_str` must have at least one character, which implies that `n` must be greater than 0, or `n` could be 0 since the string representation of 0 is '0' and thus still iterable.

However, considering `digit_str` is derived from `n`, if `n` is 0, then `digit_str` would be '0', which is a single character and can be iterated over. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `digit_str` should not be an empty string, which is guaranteed if `n` is any non-negative integer, including 0.

Given this, the loop will execute if `digit_str` is not empty, which is the case here since `n` has a string representation.

At the start of the loop, `digit` will take the value of the first character in `digit_str`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`**
