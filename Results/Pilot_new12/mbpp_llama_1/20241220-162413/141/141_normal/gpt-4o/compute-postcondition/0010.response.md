The code updates the `frequency` dictionary with the count of the `digit`. The value of `frequency[digit]` is set to 1, which means the count of the `digit` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `digit` is the second character in the original `digit_str`, `frequency[digit]` is 1**
