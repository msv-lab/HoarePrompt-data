Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and each value is the count of that digit in `digit_str`, `digit` is the next unique digit from `digit_str`, `count` is the frequency of this new `digit` in `digit_str`. If the frequency `count` of the digit is greater than the digit itself, the program returns False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
