Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.***
