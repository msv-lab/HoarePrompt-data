The value of `frequency[digit]` is assigned to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is still a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, and `digit` is still the third character in the `digit_str`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is 1**
