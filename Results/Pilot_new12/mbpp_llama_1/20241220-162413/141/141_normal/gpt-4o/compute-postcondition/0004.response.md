The value of `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `frequency[digit]` is at least 1 because `frequency` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where the first character `digit` of `digit_str` is a key, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`, and the value of `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where the first character `digit` of `digit_str` is a key, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is the previous value of `frequency[digit]` plus 1**
