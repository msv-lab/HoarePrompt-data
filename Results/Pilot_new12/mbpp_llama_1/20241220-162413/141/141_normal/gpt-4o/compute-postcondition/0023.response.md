Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and each value is the count of that digit in `digit_str`, `digit` is the next unique digit from `digit_str`, `count` is the frequency of this new `digit` in `digit_str`. If the frequency of this new `digit` in `digit_str` is greater than the integer value of this new `digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.**
