The given code increments the value of `frequency[digit]` by 1. The initial state provides information about `n`, `digit_str`, and `digit`. However, the code snippet only affects the `frequency` dictionary, specifically the value associated with the key `digit`. 

The value of `n` and the string `digit_str` remain unchanged, as does the fact that `digit` is the third character in `digit_str`. The only change is in the `frequency` dictionary, where the count for `digit` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1**
