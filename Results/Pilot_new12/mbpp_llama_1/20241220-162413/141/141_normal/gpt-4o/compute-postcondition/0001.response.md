The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `frequency`. This dictionary is not related to any previous variables, so it will be a new variable in the output state.

`n` is a non-negative integer and `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`. The values of `n` and `digit_str` are not affected by the code, so they remain the same.

The newly introduced `frequency` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary**
