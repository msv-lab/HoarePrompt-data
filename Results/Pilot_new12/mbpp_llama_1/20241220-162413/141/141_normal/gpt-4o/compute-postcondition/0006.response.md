The code `frequency[digit] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `digit` in the dictionary `frequency`. 

The value of `n` is still a non-negative integer. 
The value of `digit_str` is still a non-empty string representation of `n`. 
The value of `digit` is still the first character in `digit_str`.
The dictionary `frequency` now has `digit` as a key with a value of 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`, `frequency` is a dictionary with `digit` as a key and a value of 1**
