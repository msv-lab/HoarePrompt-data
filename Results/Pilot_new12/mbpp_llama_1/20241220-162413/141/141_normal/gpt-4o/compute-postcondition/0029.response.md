The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value. The return value depends on certain conditions, but the specific conditions are not provided. However, it is stated that there are four cases, and in three of them (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3), the function returns `False`, while in one case (Case_4), it returns `True`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `True` or `False` based on the conditions that are not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter n and returns a boolean value, either True or False, based on unspecified conditions.**
