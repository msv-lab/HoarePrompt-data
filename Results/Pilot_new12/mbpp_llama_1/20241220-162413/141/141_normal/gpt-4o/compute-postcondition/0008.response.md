To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

1. **Given State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`.
   - `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`.
   - `frequency` is a dictionary where `digit` is a key. If `digit` was already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is the previous value of `frequency[digit]` plus 1; otherwise, `frequency` has `digit` as a key with a value of 1.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for digit in digit_str:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This loop iterates over each character `digit` in the string `digit_str`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it must not have reached the end of `digit_str` yet.
   - Since `digit` is the first character in `digit_str` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `digit` must become the second character in `digit_str`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it's just used to form `digit_str` initially.
   - `digit_str` will still be a non-empty string, but since we've moved past the first character, it will either remain the same length (if we're considering its original length) or we think of it as the remaining string after removing the first character.
   - `frequency` will be updated based on the new `digit`, so if the new `digit` was already a key, its count increases by 1; if not, it's added with a count of 1.

Given these considerations, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the loop iteration directly.
- `digit_str` conceptually becomes the string after removing the first character (though its original value doesn't change, we're considering the next character in the sequence).
- `digit` becomes the next character in `digit_str`.
- `frequency` is updated based on the new `digit`.

So, the adjusted states are:
- `n` is still a non-negative integer.
- `digit_str` is still a non-empty string (conceptually considering the remaining part).
- `digit` is now the second character in the original `digit_str` (or the first character in the remaining part of `digit_str`).
- `frequency` has been updated with the new `digit` either by incrementing its count if it exists or adding it with a count of 1 if it's a new digit.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `digit` is the second character in the original `digit_str`, `frequency` is updated with the count of the new `digit`**
