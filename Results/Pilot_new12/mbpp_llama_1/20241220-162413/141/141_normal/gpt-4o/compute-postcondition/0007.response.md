Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`, and `frequency` is a dictionary where `digit` is a key, if `digit` was already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is the previous value of `frequency[digit]` plus 1, otherwise `frequency` has `digit` as a key with a value of 1**
