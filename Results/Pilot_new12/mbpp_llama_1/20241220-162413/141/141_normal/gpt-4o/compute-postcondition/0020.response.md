Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique digit from `digit_str` and each value is the count of that digit in `digit_str`, `digit` is a unique digit from `digit_str`, `count` is the frequency of `digit` in `digit_str`, and the frequency of `digit` in `digit_str` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`**
