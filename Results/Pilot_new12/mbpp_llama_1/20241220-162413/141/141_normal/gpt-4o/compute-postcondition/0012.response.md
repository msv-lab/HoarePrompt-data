According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digit_str`. If `digit_str` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again for the third character. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the second character in the original `digit_str`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `digit_str` must have at least 3 characters and `digit` is the third character in the `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is the previous count of `digit` plus 1. Otherwise, `frequency[digit]` is 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digit_str`.**
