The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input, converts it into a string representation, counts the frequency of each digit in the string, and returns a boolean value indicating whether all digit counts are less than or equal to their respective digit values. If any digit count exceeds its digit value, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all digits. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string representation (i.e., when `n` is 0), in which case `frequency` will be an empty dictionary and the function will return `True`. The function does not modify the input `n` and does not perform any actions other than the described digit frequency checks.
