You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and for every digit in `str_n`, the count of the digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit, or the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True for a non-negative integer `n` where for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of the digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `True` if the count of each digit in `n` is less than or equal to the digit's value, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits greater than 9 (in which case the comparison will always be false because the digit count cannot exceed the digit value, which is at most 9). For example, the function will return `True` for inputs like 12, 123, or 9, but `False` for inputs like 11, 22, or 111. The function does not modify the input integer `n` and only uses it to calculate the return value. The final state of the program after execution is that the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and a boolean value (`True` or `False`) is returned based on the digit count comparison.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
