Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function iterates over each digit in the string representation of `n` and uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of each digit. If the count of any digit exceeds the digit's value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the function iterates over all digits without finding any that exceed their count, it returns `True`.

This function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It checks every digit in the input integer `n` and compares its frequency to its value. The function works for single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits greater than 9, as the comparison will indeed always be false for the latter case because the digit count cannot exceed the digit value (which is at most 9).

The output hints provided align with the functionality of the code. For example, the function will return `True` for inputs like 12, 123, or 9, as the frequency of each digit does not exceed its value. Conversely, it will return `False` for inputs like 11, 22, or 111, as the frequency of the repeated digit exceeds its value.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description, and it does not modify the input integer `n` while correctly computing and returning the boolean value based on the digit count comparison, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
