Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the given problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n` to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It then iterates over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit, it checks if the count of the digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the digit.
3. If the count is greater, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the condition is not met for the given integer.
4. If the loop completes without finding any digit with a count greater than its value, the function returns `True`, indicating that the condition is met for all digits in the integer.

The program correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases because:

- It checks every digit in the integer.
- It correctly counts the occurrences of each digit.
- It compares the count of each digit with its integer value.
- It returns `True` only if the condition is met for all digits, and `False` otherwise.

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-negative integer) means that the program does not need to handle cases like negative integers, non-integer inputs, or empty inputs, which could otherwise cause errors or incorrect results. Given this assumption, the program accurately implements the logic specified in the problem description.
