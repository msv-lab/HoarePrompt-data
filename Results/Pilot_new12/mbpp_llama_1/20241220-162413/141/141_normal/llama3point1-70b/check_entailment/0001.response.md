Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly implement the problem description. It converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n`, then iterates over each digit in the string. For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in the string is greater than the digit itself (converted back to an integer). If it finds any digit that appears more times than its value, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all digits without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This logic directly follows the problem description, ensuring that the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function handles all possible cases correctly, including single-digit numbers, numbers with repeating digits, and numbers with digits that are zero (since the count of '0' in a string cannot exceed 0, any occurrence of '0' will always satisfy the condition).

I have not been able to find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct for all potential inputs and cases.
