Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, converts it to a string `str_n`, and then checks the frequency of each digit in the string. For each digit, it counts the occurrences of the digit in the string using `str_n.count(digit)` and compares it to the integer value of the digit using `int(digit)`. If the count of any digit is greater than its value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such digit, the function returns `True`.

This logic is consistent with the problem description, which requires that the frequency of each digit in the integer be less than or equal to the digit itself. The program correctly handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits greater than 9.

For example, the program will return `True` for inputs like 12, 123, or 9, but `False` for inputs like 11, 22, or 111, which is in line with the expected behavior described in the problem description. Overall, the program accurately implements the required logic and returns the correct result for all valid inputs.
