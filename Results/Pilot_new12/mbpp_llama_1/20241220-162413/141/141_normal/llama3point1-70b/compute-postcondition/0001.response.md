According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `str_n`. If `str_n` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, for `str_n` to be not empty, `n` must be greater than 0 or `str_n` must be '0'. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer and `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `str_n` must have at least one character, and `digit` is the first character in `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n` and must have at least one character, `digit` is the first character in `str_n`**
