According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `str_n`. If `str_n` has at least two characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `str_n` has at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `str_n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `str_n` must have at least three characters (since the first character has already been processed and the second character has just been processed), and `digit` must be the third character in `str_n`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n` with at least three characters, and `digit` is the third character in `str_n`**
