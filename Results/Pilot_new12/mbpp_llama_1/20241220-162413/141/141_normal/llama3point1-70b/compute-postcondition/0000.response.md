The code assigns the string representation of `n` to the variable `str_n`. 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` will be a string of digits representing the value of `n`. 

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is only used to compute the value of `str_n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`**
