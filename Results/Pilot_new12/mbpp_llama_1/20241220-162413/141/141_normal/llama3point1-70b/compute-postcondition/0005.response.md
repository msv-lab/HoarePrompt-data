According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `str_n`. If `str_n` has at least two characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` has at least one character, `digit` is the first character in `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. For the loop to execute one more time, `str_n` must have at least two characters, `digit` must be the second character in `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in the remaining string (from the second character to the end) is less than or equal to the integer value of the new `digit`. Also, since `n` is the integer representation of `str_n`, it does not need to change because it is derived from `str_n`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n` and must have at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `str_n`, and the count of `digit` in the remaining string (from the second character to the end) is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`**
