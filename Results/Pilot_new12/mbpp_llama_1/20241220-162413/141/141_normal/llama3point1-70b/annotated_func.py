#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and for every digit in `str_n`, the count of the digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit, or the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True for a non-negative integer `n` where for every digit in the string representation of `n`, the count of the digit is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `True` if the count of each digit in `n` is less than or equal to the digit's value, otherwise it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as single-digit numbers, numbers with repeated digits, and numbers with digits greater than 9 (in which case the comparison will always be false because the digit count cannot exceed the digit value, which is at most 9). For example, the function will return `True` for inputs like 12, 123, or 9, but `False` for inputs like 11, 22, or 111. The function does not modify the input integer `n` and only uses it to calculate the return value. The final state of the program after execution is that the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and a boolean value (`True` or `False`) is returned based on the digit count comparison.
