The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the original strings sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The original list of lists remains unchanged. The function handles lists of varying lengths and sublists with varying numbers of strings, including empty sublists. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function does not perform any validation on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input contains non-string elements or non-list structures, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.
