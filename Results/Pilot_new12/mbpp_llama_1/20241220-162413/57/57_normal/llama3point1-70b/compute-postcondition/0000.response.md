To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. 

The code snippet is: 
```python
return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```
This code snippet uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it sorts the strings in the sublist in a case-insensitive manner (due to `key=str.lower`) and then returns a new list of these sorted sublists.

Therefore, the program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as in the original sublists but sorted in a case-insensitive manner.

Output State: **The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings sorted in a case-insensitive manner.**
