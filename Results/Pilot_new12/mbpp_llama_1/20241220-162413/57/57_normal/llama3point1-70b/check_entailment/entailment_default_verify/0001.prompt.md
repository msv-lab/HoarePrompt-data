You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted.

Here is why the code is correct:
- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists.
- For each sublist, it uses the built-in `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to sort the strings in a case-insensitive manner.
- The sorted sublists are then returned as a new list of lists.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:
- Empty sublists: These are simply returned as empty lists.
- Sublists with a single element: These are returned as is, since they are already sorted.
- Sublists with multiple elements: These are sorted correctly using the `sorted` function.
- Sublists containing duplicate elements: These are also handled correctly, since the `sorted` function is stable and preserves the order of equal elements.
- Sublists containing elements with different cases: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the original strings sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The original list of lists remains unchanged. The function handles lists of varying lengths and sublists with varying numbers of strings, including empty sublists. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function does not perform any validation on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input contains non-string elements or non-list structures, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
