Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function `func_1` utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it applies the built-in `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to perform a case-insensitive sort. This ensures that the original case of the strings is preserved, but the sorting is done without considering the case.

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case:
- It handles lists of varying lengths and sublists with varying numbers of strings.
- It correctly sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner.
- If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list.
- It does not modify the original list of lists, returning a new list of lists instead.

Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list of lists of strings), the program does not include error checking for invalid input types or structures. However, under the premise that valid input is guaranteed, the program functions as intended and correctly sorts each sublist of strings. 

Therefore, the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
