Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

- The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist in a case-insensitive manner. The `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.
- The function returns a new list of lists, leaving the original list of lists unchanged.
- It handles lists of varying lengths and sublists with varying numbers of strings, including empty sublists.
- If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.

For every potential case, the program will work as expected because it correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, handles lists of varying lengths, and returns a new list of lists without modifying the original input. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the program will not encounter any errors due to invalid input.
