Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling lists of varying lengths, sublists with varying numbers of strings, and empty sublists.

The reason I maintain the original assessment is that the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist, sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument, and returns a new list of lists without modifying the original list.

The output hints also support the correctness of the program. They indicate that the function handles various cases correctly, including empty sublists, sublists with a single element, and sublists with multiple elements. The hints also mention that the function does not perform any validation on the input, which is in line with the assumption that the input will be valid.

The only potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results if the input contains non-string elements or non-list structures. However, this is not a correctness issue, as the problem description assumes that the input will be a list of lists of strings.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
