Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it calls the built-in `sorted` function with the `key` argument set to `str.lower`. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

The function will work correctly for all possible inputs, including empty sublists, sublists with duplicate elements, and sublists with elements of different lengths. It will also handle sublists containing strings with non-English characters or special characters.

Here are some example inputs and their expected outputs:

* Input: `[["hello", "World"], ["apple", "Banana"], ["xyz", "ABC"]]`
  Output: `[["hello", "World"], ["apple", "Banana"], ["ABC", "xyz"]]`
* Input: `[["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"], []]`
  Output: `[["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"], []]`
* Input: `[["London", "Paris", "Rome"], ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"]]`
  Output: `[["London", "Paris", "Rome"], ["Chicago", "Los Angeles", "New York"]]`

In all these cases, the function sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description. Since the function works correctly for all possible inputs, its correctness is **True**.
