Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted.

Here is why the code is correct:
- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists.
- For each sublist, it uses the built-in `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to sort the strings in a case-insensitive manner.
- The sorted sublists are then returned as a new list of lists.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including:
- Empty sublists: These are simply returned as empty lists.
- Sublists with a single element: These are returned as is, since they are already sorted.
- Sublists with multiple elements: These are sorted correctly using the `sorted` function.
- Sublists containing duplicate elements: These are also handled correctly, since the `sorted` function is stable and preserves the order of equal elements.
- Sublists containing elements with different cases: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
