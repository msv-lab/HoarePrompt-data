The original assessment states that the program is correct, and based on the provided code and problem description, this assessment seems accurate. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. 

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. The annotation before the function call states that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings, which matches the expected input. The annotation after the function call states that the program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings sorted in a case-insensitive manner, which matches the expected output.

The original assessment provides a detailed explanation of why the code is correct, including its handling of empty sublists, sublists with a single element, sublists with multiple elements, sublists containing duplicate elements, and sublists containing elements with different cases. This explanation is thorough and accurate, and it confirms that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the original assessment, the annotated code, and the problem description, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
