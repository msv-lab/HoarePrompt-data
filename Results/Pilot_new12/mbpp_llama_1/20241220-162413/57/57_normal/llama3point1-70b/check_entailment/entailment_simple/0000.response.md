The given Python program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The problem description requires a function to sort each sublist of strings, and this program does exactly that.

Here is why the program is correct:

- The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains strings.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the list of lists.
- For each sublist, it applies the built-in `sorted` function with a `key` argument set to `str.lower`. This means that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner, treating 'a' and 'A' as equal.
- The results of sorting each sublist are collected in a new list of lists, which is then returned by the function.
- The program handles the sorting of sublists correctly and does not modify the original list of lists but returns a new sorted list of lists instead.

Since the program does what the problem description asks for every potential case (sorting each sublist of strings in a list of lists in a case-insensitive manner), it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
