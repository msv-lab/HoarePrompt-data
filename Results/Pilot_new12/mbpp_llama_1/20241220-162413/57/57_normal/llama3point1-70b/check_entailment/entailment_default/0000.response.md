Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it performs the specified task of sorting each sublist of strings in the input list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The function uses list comprehension and the built-in `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument to achieve this. This approach ensures that the sorting is performed without considering the case of the strings.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that it handles various edge cases, including lists of varying lengths, sublists with varying numbers of strings, and empty sublists. The function also returns an empty list when the input list is empty.

Since we assume that the input will be valid, the code's lack of input validation does not affect its correctness. The code will work correctly as long as the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings, and will not cause any errors due to invalid input.

Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
