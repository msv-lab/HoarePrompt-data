The problem description requires a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1` meets this requirement, and its correctness is **True**.

Upon examining the code and the annotations, it appears that the function indeed sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner. The use of the `key=str.lower` argument in the `sorted` function ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, which aligns with the expected behavior.

The annotations provided also support the correctness of the function. Before the function call, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing strings, and after the function call, the program returns a list of lists where each sublist contains strings sorted in a case-insensitive manner.

Given the information available, the original assessment seems accurate. The function works as expected, sorting each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, and the annotations confirm this behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
