The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code successfully sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists and calls the built-in `sorted` function with the `key` argument set to `str.lower`, ensuring that the sorting is case-insensitive.

The output hints provided align with the expected behavior of the function. They indicate that the function accepts a list of lists of strings, returns a new list of lists with sorted sublists, and handles lists of varying lengths, including empty lists. The hints also mention that the original list remains unchanged, which is consistent with the implementation of the function.

The only potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function does not perform input validation and may raise an error or produce unexpected results if the input contains non-string elements or non-list structures. However, based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input will always be valid (a list of lists of strings), so this does not affect the correctness of the function within the specified constraints.

Given that the function correctly implements the required behavior for the specified input type and the original assessment accurately reflects this, there's no reason to change the assessment.

Final: **True**
