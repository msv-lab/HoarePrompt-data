#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but the strings are sorted in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but in ascending order. The function preserves the original list and its sublists, and does not modify them. It handles empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, returning empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings in sorted order, respectively. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input is not in this format, the function may raise an exception or behave unexpectedly.
