You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem. The problem asks for a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists, and sorts each sublist using the built-in `sorted` function. This results in a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs, including lists with different numbers of sublists and sublists with different numbers of strings. The function handles these cases correctly, sorting each sublist in lexicographical order.

In general, the function should work correctly for any list of lists of strings, regardless of the number of sublists or the length of the strings. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists where each inner list contains only strings. However, this is a reasonable assumption given the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem and handles all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but in ascending order. The function preserves the original list and its sublists, and does not modify them. It handles empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, returning empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings in sorted order, respectively. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input is not in this format, the function may raise an exception or behave unexpectedly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
