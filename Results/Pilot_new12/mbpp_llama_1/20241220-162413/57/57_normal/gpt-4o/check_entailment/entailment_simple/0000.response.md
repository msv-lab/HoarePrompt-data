Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists and applies the built-in `sorted` function to sort the strings in ascending order.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Iteration over sublists**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. This ensures that every sublist is processed.
2. **Sorting of strings**: The `sorted` function is used to sort the strings in each sublist. By default, `sorted` sorts strings in lexicographical (alphabetical) order, which meets the problem's requirements.
3. **Preservation of original list structure**: The program returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input list, but in sorted order. This preserves the original list structure.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the program's correctness for various input scenarios, including lists with different numbers of sublists and strings with varying lengths and contents.

Since the program meets the problem description's requirements for every potential case, it is correct.
