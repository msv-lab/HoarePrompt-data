Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists` and sorts the strings in each sublist using the `sorted` function.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

* Sublists with duplicate strings: The `sorted` function returns a new list with the strings in sorted order, including duplicates.
* Empty sublists: The `sorted` function returns an empty list when given an empty list as input.
* Sublists with strings in any order: The `sorted` function returns a new list with the strings in sorted order, regardless of their original order.

The function also preserves the original list and its sublists, as required by the problem description, because it creates a new list of lists with the sorted sublists, rather than modifying the original list.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, as specified in the problem description.
