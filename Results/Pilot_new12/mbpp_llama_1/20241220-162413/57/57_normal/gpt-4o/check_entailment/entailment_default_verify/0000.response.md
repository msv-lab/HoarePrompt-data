Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** appears to be accurate. 

The problem description asks for a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists and sorts each sublist using the built-in `sorted` function. This results in a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted, which meets the requirements described in the problem.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, preserving the original list and its sublists, handling empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, and returning a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but in ascending order.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function does not perform any error checking on the input, but since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
