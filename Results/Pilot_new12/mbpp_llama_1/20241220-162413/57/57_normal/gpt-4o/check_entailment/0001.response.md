Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a simple and efficient solution to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and the built-in `sorted` function to sort the strings in ascending order.

The code works as follows:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input.
- It iterates over each sublist in the input list using a list comprehension.
- For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function, which returns a new list containing the elements of the sublist in ascending order.
- The sorted sublists are then collected into a new list, which is returned as the result.

The program correctly handles the sorting of sublists containing strings, including cases with leading or trailing whitespace and different casing. The `sorted` function in Python is stable and sorts elements based on their lexicographical order, which is suitable for sorting lists of strings.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the program's correctness for various input scenarios. Since the code is straightforward and the `sorted` function is a well-tested and reliable part of the Python standard library, it is reasonable to conclude that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
