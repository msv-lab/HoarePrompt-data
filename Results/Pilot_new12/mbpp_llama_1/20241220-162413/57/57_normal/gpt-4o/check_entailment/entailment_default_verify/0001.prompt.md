You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a simple and efficient solution to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and the built-in `sorted` function to sort the strings in ascending order.

The code works as follows:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input.
- It iterates over each sublist in the input list using a list comprehension.
- For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function, which returns a new list containing the elements of the sublist in ascending order.
- The sorted sublists are then collected into a new list, which is returned as the result.

The program correctly handles the sorting of sublists containing strings, including cases with leading or trailing whitespace and different casing. The `sorted` function in Python is stable and sorts elements based on their lexicographical order, which is suitable for sorting lists of strings.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the program's correctness for various input scenarios. Since the code is straightforward and the `sorted` function is a well-tested and reliable part of the Python standard library, it is reasonable to conclude that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but in ascending order. The function preserves the original list and its sublists, and does not modify them. It handles empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, returning empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings in sorted order, respectively. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input is not in this format, the function may raise an exception or behave unexpectedly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
