Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code looks correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in the input list of lists. The `sorted` function is used to sort each sublist, and the result is a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but in ascending order. 

The function preserves the original list and its sublists, and does not modify them. It handles empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, returning empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings in sorted order, respectively.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs, including lists with different lengths and strings. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function does not need to perform any error checking on the input. 

Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
