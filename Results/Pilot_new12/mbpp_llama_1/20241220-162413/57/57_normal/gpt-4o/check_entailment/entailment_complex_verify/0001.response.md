Based on the provided information, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The program sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists correctly. The annotated version of the code does not reveal any new issues or inconsistencies with the problem description. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the program's correctness for various input scenarios, including cases with leading or trailing whitespace and different casing. The `sorted` function in Python is stable and sorts elements based on their lexicographical order, which is suitable for sorting lists of strings.

The annotated code states that the function preserves the original list and its sublists, and does not modify them, which is consistent with the problem description. It also mentions that the function handles empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, returning empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings in sorted order, respectively.

One potential issue mentioned in the annotated code is that the function does not perform any error checking on the input. However, as stated in the problem description, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

In conclusion, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and the annotated version of the code does not provide any evidence to contradict this assessment.

Final: **True**
