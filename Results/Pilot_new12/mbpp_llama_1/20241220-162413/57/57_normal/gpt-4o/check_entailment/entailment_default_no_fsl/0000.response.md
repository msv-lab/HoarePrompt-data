Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description, which is to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The code uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist, which returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order.

The output hints and the provided unit tests suggest that the function handles various cases correctly, such as:

* Non-empty sublists with multiple strings
* Sublists with duplicate strings
* Sublists with different lengths
* Lists containing multiple sublists

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of lists where each sublist contains only strings), the function does not need to perform any error checking.

The code does not modify the original list or its sublists, which is also in line with the problem description.

Overall, based on the provided information, the code appears to correctly implement the problem description and handles various potential cases correctly.
