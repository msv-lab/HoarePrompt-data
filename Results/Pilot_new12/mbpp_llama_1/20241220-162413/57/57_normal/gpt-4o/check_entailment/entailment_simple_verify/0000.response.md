The original assessment of the program's correctness appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

The annotated version of the code provides further confirmation of the program's correctness. The annotation states that the program returns a list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but the strings are sorted in ascending order. This matches the expected behavior described in the problem description.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs, including lists with different numbers of sublists and sublists with different numbers of strings.

One potential concern could be that the function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing non-string elements. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
