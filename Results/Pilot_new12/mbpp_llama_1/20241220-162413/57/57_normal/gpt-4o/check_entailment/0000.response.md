Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem. The problem asks for a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, and the provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists, and sorts each sublist using the built-in `sorted` function. This results in a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different inputs, including lists with different numbers of sublists and sublists with different numbers of strings. The function handles these cases correctly, sorting each sublist in lexicographical order.

In general, the function should work correctly for any list of lists of strings, regardless of the number of sublists or the length of the strings. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists where each inner list contains only strings. However, this is a reasonable assumption given the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem and handles all potential cases correctly.
