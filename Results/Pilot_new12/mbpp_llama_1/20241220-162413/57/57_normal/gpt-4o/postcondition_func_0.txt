The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but in ascending order. The function preserves the original list and its sublists, and does not modify them. It handles empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings correctly, returning empty sublists and sublists with duplicate strings in sorted order, respectively. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists, where each sublist contains only strings. If the input is not in this format, the function may raise an exception or behave unexpectedly.
