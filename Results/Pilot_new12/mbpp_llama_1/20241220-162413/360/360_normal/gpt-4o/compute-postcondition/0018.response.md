To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information and code.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `list_of_lists` is a non-empty list of lists containing numbers.
   - `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity.
   - `max_list` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it calculates the sum of the elements (`current_sum = sum(sublist)`).
   - If `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.

3. **Output State After Loop Execution**:
   - Given that `list_of_lists` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once.
   - After the loop finishes executing, `max_sum` will hold the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`.
   - `max_list` will be the sublist with the maximum sum.
   - If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max_list` will be the last sublist encountered with this maximum sum during the iteration.
   - `sublist` will be the last sublist processed in the loop.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop will not execute. In this case, `max_sum` remains negative infinity, and `max_list` remains an empty list.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be summarized as follows:

- `list_of_lists` remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum.
- The state of `sublist` is determined by the last iteration of the loop, but its value after the loop is not as significant as `max_sum` and `max_list` for understanding the outcome of the loop.

Therefore, the output state can be described in terms of the final values of `max_sum` and `max_list`, considering the initial state and the loop's behavior.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` is negative infinity and `max_list` is an empty list.**
