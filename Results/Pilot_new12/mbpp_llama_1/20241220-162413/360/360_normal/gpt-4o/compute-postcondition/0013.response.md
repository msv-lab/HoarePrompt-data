According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 sublists, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 sublists and the `sublist` is the third sublist in the `list_of_lists`. 
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` and `max_list` are based on the first two sublists, and `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the second sublist**
