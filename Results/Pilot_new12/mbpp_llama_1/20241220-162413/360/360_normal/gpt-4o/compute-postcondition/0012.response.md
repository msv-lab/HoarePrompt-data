Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the sum of the elements in `sublist` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the sum of the elements in `sublist` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged from their previous values based on the first sublist, and `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.***
