The code calculates the sum of the elements in the `sublist` and assigns it to the variable `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` is now equal to the sum of the elements in the second sublist of `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain as previously determined based on the first sublist, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
