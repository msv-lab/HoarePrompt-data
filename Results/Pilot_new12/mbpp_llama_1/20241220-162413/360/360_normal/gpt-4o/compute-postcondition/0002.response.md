According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `list_of_lists` is not empty, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to provide a complete state, we need to consider the state of the variables `sublist`, `max_sum`, and `max_list` at the start of the loop.

At the start of the loop, `sublist` should be the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is negative infinity, and `max_list` is an empty list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list**
