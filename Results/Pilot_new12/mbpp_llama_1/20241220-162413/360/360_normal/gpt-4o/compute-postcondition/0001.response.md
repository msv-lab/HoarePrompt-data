The code initializes an empty list `max_list`. The initial state's information about `list_of_lists` being a non-empty list of lists with numbers and `max_sum` being negative infinity remains unchanged, as the code does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty; `max_sum` is negative infinity; `max_list` is an empty list**
