The code `max_list = sublist` assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is now equal to the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the third sublist, and `max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the third sublist**
