The code initializes a new variable `max_sum` and assigns it the value of negative infinity. This new variable `max_sum` will be used to keep track of the maximum sum found. 

The variable `list_of_lists` remains unchanged as it is a list of lists where each sublist contains numbers and is not empty. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty; `max_sum` is negative infinity.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty; `max_sum` is negative infinity**
