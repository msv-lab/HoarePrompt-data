The code `max_list = sublist` assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. Given that `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` will now be equal to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is equal to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
