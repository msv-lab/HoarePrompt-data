`max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`, which is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_list` remains as previously determined based on the first sublist, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`.
