According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 sublists and the `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The values of `max_sum` and `max_list` also need to be considered, but their update depends on the comparison with the sum of elements in the current `sublist`, not on the loop iteration itself. Therefore, their state remains dependent on the previous iteration's outcome and the new `sublist`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain as previously determined based on the first sublist**
