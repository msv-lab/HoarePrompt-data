Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `current_sum` (the sum of the elements in the third sublist) is greater than `max_sum` (originally based on the first two sublists), then `max_list` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists` and `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`. Otherwise, the state of `max_sum` and `max_list` remains unchanged, with `max_sum` and `max_list` still based on either the first two sublists or previously updated values.***
