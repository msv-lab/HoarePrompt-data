You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, and list_of_lists is not empty.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` is negative infinity and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns max_list, which is the sublist with the maximum sum from list_of_lists. If list_of_lists is empty, max_list is an empty list. Otherwise, max_list is a sublist of numbers from list_of_lists with a sum equal to max_sum, the maximum sum of all sublists in list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_list, which is the sublist with the maximum sum from list_of_lists. If list_of_lists is empty, max_list is an empty list. Otherwise, max_list is a sublist of numbers from list_of_lists with a sum equal to max_sum, the maximum sum of all sublists in list_of_lists.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
