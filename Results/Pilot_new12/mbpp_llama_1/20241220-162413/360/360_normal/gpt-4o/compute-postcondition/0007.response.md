Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, if the sum of the elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists` is greater than the initial `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists` and `max_list` is equal to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged, with `max_sum` being negative infinity and `max_list` being an empty list.***
