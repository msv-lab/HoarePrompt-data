`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `sublist`. The value of `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, so `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first sublist of `list_of_lists`**
