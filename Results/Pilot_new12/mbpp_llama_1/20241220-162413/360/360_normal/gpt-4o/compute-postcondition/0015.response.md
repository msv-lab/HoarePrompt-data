The code updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third sublist (`sublist`). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The `list_of_lists` is still a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is still the third sublist, and `max_list` is still based on the first two sublists.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is based on the first two sublists, `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the elements in the third sublist, and `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of the elements in the third sublist**
