Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function iterates over each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list, a list containing empty sublists, and a list containing sublists with negative numbers. After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function returns the first one encountered. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains numbers.**
