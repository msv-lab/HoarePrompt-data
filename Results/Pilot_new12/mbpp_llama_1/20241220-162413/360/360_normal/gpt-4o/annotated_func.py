#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, and list_of_lists is not empty.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` is negative infinity and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns max_list, which is the sublist with the maximum sum from list_of_lists. If list_of_lists is empty, max_list is an empty list. Otherwise, max_list is a sublist of numbers from list_of_lists with a sum equal to max_sum, the maximum sum of all sublists in list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function iterates over each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list, a list containing empty sublists, and a list containing sublists with negative numbers. After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function returns the first one encountered. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains numbers.
