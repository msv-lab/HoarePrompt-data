Correctness: **True**.

The program seems to handle all cases correctly. It iterates over each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of its elements, and checks if this sum is greater than the current maximum sum found. If it is, the program updates the maximum sum and stores the current sublist as the list with the maximum sum.

The use of `float('-inf')` as the initial maximum sum ensures that the first sublist's sum will always be greater, and therefore, the first sublist will be initially considered as the list with the maximum sum.

The program's logic is straightforward and does not contain any apparent flaws. It handles list of lists with any number of sublists and any number of elements in each sublist, including empty sublists. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns the first one it encounters.

I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

Here are some additional test cases that demonstrate the program's correctness:
```python
assert func_1([[]]) == []
assert func_1([[1], [2]]) == [2]
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) == [5, 6]
```
