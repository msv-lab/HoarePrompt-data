Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks to write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

The given Python function, `func_1`, iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. 

After iterating through all sublists, it returns the sublist with the maximum sum. 

This is exactly what the problem description asks for. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. This is a good starting point because any sum will be greater than negative infinity.

2. The function then iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of the elements in the sublist.

3. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to the current sum and `max_list` to the current sublist.

4. After iterating through all sublists, `max_sum` will hold the maximum sum of all sublists and `max_list` will hold the sublist with the maximum sum.

5. The function then returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the maximum sum.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function will return the first one it encounters. This is a valid interpretation of the problem description, which does not specify what to do in case of a tie.

- If the input list of lists is empty, the function will return an empty list. However, as per the problem description, this case is not expected to occur, and we assume that the input will always be valid.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
