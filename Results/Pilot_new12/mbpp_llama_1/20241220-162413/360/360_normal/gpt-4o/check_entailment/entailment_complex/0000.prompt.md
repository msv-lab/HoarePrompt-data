You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers, and list_of_lists is not empty.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` is negative infinity and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns max_list, which is the sublist with the maximum sum from list_of_lists. If list_of_lists is empty, max_list is an empty list. Otherwise, max_list is a sublist of numbers from list_of_lists with a sum equal to max_sum, the maximum sum of all sublists in list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists of numbers as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list. The function iterates over each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list, a list containing empty sublists, and a list containing sublists with negative numbers. After the function concludes, the input list remains unchanged, and the function returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function returns the first one encountered. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains numbers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
