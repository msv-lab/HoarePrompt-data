The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the program correctly implements the functionality to return the sublist with the highest sum of elements from a given list of lists.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum of elements, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far. The use of `float('-inf')` to initialize `max_sum` ensures that the first sublist's sum will be greater than `max_sum`, allowing the program to correctly handle the case where all sums are negative.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one sublist, as demonstrated by the unit test `assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]`. Additionally, the program handles potential edge cases such as an empty input list, a list containing empty sublists, and a list containing sublists with negative numbers.

The only potential issue mentioned in the annotated code is that the function does not perform any error checking on the input, assuming that the input is a list of lists where each sublist contains numbers. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.

Final: **True**
