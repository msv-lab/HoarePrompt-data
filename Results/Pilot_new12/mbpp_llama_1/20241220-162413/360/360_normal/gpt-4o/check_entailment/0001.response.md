Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in the current sublist, and checks if this sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far. If it is, the program updates the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist. This process ensures that the sublist with the highest sum of elements is returned.

The use of `float('-inf')` to initialize `max_sum` guarantees that the first sublist's sum will be greater than `max_sum`, allowing the program to correctly handle the case where all sums are negative. Additionally, the program handles the case where there is only one sublist, as demonstrated by the unit test `assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]`.

In the provided unit tests, the function behaves correctly and returns the expected results. After reviewing the code and considering potential edge cases, no scenario was found where the program does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
