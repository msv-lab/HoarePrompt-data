Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements from the input list of lists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that the first sublist encountered will have a higher sum and will be stored in `max_list`.

2. **Iteration over sublists**: The program iterates over each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements using the built-in `sum` function.

3. **Comparison and update**: If the sum of the current sublist is greater than the current `max_sum`, the program updates `max_sum` with the new sum and stores the current sublist in `max_list`.

4. **Return**: After iterating over all sublists, the program returns `max_list`, which contains the sublist with the highest sum.

The program handles edge cases implicitly:

- **Empty input list**: Although the problem statement and the code's comments mention the possibility of an empty input list, the code does not explicitly handle this case. However, due to the assumption that the input will be valid and non-empty, this case is not considered.

- **Sublists with the same maximum sum**: The program returns the first sublist encountered with the maximum sum, which aligns with the problem description's requirement to return the sublist with the highest sum.

- **Negative numbers**: The program correctly handles sublists containing negative numbers, as the `sum` function works with both positive and negative numbers.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and returns the correct result for all valid inputs.
