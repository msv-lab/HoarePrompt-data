Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements. The function uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which calculates the sum of each sublist and returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

The code correctly handles various cases, including:

1.  **Multiple sublists with the same maximum sum**: The function returns one of the sublists with the maximum sum, as stated in the output hints.
2.  **Empty sublists**: The function considers empty sublists as having a sum of 0, which is the expected behavior.
3.  **Integers and floats**: The function handles both integers and floats as valid numbers in the sublists, as mentioned in the output hints.
4.  **Return value**: The function returns a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy, as stated in the output hints.

The only potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty. However, this behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description as an expected outcome, and it can be argued that the function is still correct according to the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid and non-empty.

Overall, based on the provided information, the code seems to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and no counterexamples can be found within the given constraints.
