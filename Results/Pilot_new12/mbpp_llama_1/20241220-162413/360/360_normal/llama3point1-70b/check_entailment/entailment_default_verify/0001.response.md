The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality by returning the sublist with the highest sum of elements. 

The output hints support this assessment, as they confirm that the function behaves as expected: it returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements, does not modify the original list, handles empty sublists and both integers and floats, and raises a ValueError when given an empty list.

The provided code is straightforward and utilizes built-in Python functions, such as `max` and `sum`, which are well-tested and reliable. The use of the `key` parameter in the `max` function ensures that the sublists are compared based on the sum of their elements.

One potential concern could be the handling of edge cases, such as empty lists or lists containing non-numeric values. However, as per the problem description, it is assumed that the user will provide valid input, which means these edge cases are not expected to occur.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I maintain the original assessment of the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
