Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The `max` function in Python is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which means that `max` will return the sublist that has the maximum sum.

This code works correctly for all potential cases because:

1. The `max` function can handle empty lists, returning `None` or raising a `ValueError` if the input is empty, but it's not a problem here since the function is expected to return a list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
2. The `sum` function can handle lists of different lengths and will sum all the elements in a sublist.
3. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the `max` function will return the first one it encounters.

The only potential case where the function might not work as expected is when the input list is empty. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, and the function's behavior in this case (raising a `ValueError`) may be considered correct.

Here are some example test cases that demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])` returns `[7, 8, 9]`
* `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]])` returns `[3, 4, 5]`
* `func_1([[]])` returns `[]` (note: this is not the only possible correct behavior)

In general, the code is correct because it uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument to compare the sums of the sublists, and this approach works for all possible inputs.
