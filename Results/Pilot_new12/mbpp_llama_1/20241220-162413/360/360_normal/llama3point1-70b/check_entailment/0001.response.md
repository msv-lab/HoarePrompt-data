Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct as it successfully implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as an input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. 

Here's why it works:

- The built-in `max` function is used to find the maximum item in an iterable (in this case, `lists`).
- The `key` parameter of the `max` function is a function that takes one argument and returns one value. It is used to determine the sort order.
- By setting `key=sum`, the `max` function compares the sums of the sublists when determining which sublist is the maximum.
- If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max` will return the first one it encounters, as it stops comparing as soon as it finds the first maximum.

There are no edge cases or potential cases that the code does not handle. For example, it correctly handles empty sublists (sum of an empty list is 0), sublists containing non-numeric values (this would raise a TypeError, which is the expected behavior since the problem description doesn't specify what to do in this case), and an empty list of lists (this would raise a ValueError, which is the expected behavior since the problem description doesn't specify what to do in this case). 

Even though there are some edge cases where the program raises an exception, like an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values, the program description does not specify the expected behavior in these cases. However, the program can be considered correct for the specified problem description, considering that the user will provide valid input. 

It is also worth noting that Python's built-in functions and data structures are usually well-tested and reliable, so unless there is a specific reason to believe otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that `max` and `sum` will work as expected. 

Finally, without any additional information about the expected behavior in edge cases, the program can be considered correct according to the problem description.
