Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The provided function, `func_1`, uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements. 

This solution works as expected for all potential cases, including:

- When there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them.
- When the input list contains empty sublists, they are considered with a sum of 0.
- When the input list contains sublists with integers or floats, the function handles both cases correctly.
- The function does not modify the original list of lists.

The function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty because the `max` function requires at least one element to operate. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this edge case is not considered an issue in this context.

Overall, the function correctly implements the behavior described in the problem description, making the correctness of the program **True**.
