You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The `max` function in Python is used with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which means that `max` will return the sublist that has the maximum sum.

This code works correctly for all potential cases because:

1. The `max` function can handle empty lists, returning `None` or raising a `ValueError` if the input is empty, but it's not a problem here since the function is expected to return a list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
2. The `sum` function can handle lists of different lengths and will sum all the elements in a sublist.
3. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the `max` function will return the first one it encounters.

The only potential case where the function might not work as expected is when the input list is empty. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, and the function's behavior in this case (raising a `ValueError`) may be considered correct.

Here are some example test cases that demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])` returns `[7, 8, 9]`
* `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]])` returns `[3, 4, 5]`
* `func_1([[]])` returns `[]` (note: this is not the only possible correct behavior)

In general, the code is correct because it uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument to compare the sums of the sublists, and this approach works for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not modify the original list of lists. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If the input list contains empty sublists, they will be considered with a sum of 0. The function handles both integers and floats as valid numbers in the sublists. The return value is a reference to one of the original sublists, not a copy.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
